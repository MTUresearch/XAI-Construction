AB  - Uncertainty quantification is a vital aspect of explainable artificial intelligence that fosters clinician trust in medical applications and facilitates timely interventions, leading to safer and more reliable outcomes. Although deep learning models have reached clinically acceptable accuracy in anatomical landmark detection, their predictions remain susceptible to contextual noise due to the small size of the target structures, making uncertainty quantification more challenging than in classification and segmentation tasks. This paper presents an end-to-end uncertainty quantification method tailored for heatmap-based anatomical landmark detection models, designed to improve both interpretability and controllability in clinical applications. Leveraging Dempster-Shafer Theory and Subjective Logic Theory, we implement probability assignment and uncertainty quantification through a single forward pass to ensure computational efficiency. We introduce an evidence map that captures the strength of landmark evidence, alongside an uncertainty map that calibrates predicted probabilities within the Subjective Logic framework. The interaction between these two components, facilitated by a cross-attention mechanism, further improves landmark detection accuracy and enhances the effectiveness of uncertainty quantification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method maintains detection accuracy, even in noisy environments, while outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of uncertainty quantification and quality control. Furthermore, the model effectively identifies out-of-distribution data solely through calibrated probabilities when encountering inconsistencies in multi-center data and novel data, underscoring its potential for clinical applications.

AB  - Humans are experts at making decisions for challenging driving tasks with uncertainties. Many efforts have been made to model the decision-making process of human drivers at the behavior level. However, limited studies explain how human drivers actively make trustworthy sequential decisions to complete interactive driving tasks in an uncertain environment. This paper argues that human drivers intently search for actions to reduce the uncertainty of their perception of the environment, i.e., perceptual uncertainty, to a low level that allows them to make a trustworthy decision easily. This paper provides a proof-of-concept framework to empirically reveal that human drivers’ perceptual uncertainty decreases when executing interactive tasks with uncertainties. We first introduce an explainable-artificial intelligence approach (i.e., SHapley Additive exPlanation, SHAP) to determine the salient features on which human drivers base decisions. Then, we use entropy-based measures to quantify the drivers’ perceptual changes in these ranked salient features across the decision-making process, reflecting the changes in uncertainties. The validation and verification of our proposed method are conducted in the highway on-ramp merging scenario with congested traffic using the INTERACTION dataset. Experimental results support that human drivers intentionally seek information to reduce their perceptual uncertainties in the number and rank of salient features of their perception of environments to make a trustworthy decision.

AB  - This research introduces a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-enabled framework to enhance the cybersecurity of Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM) systems. While AIM systems optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion, their reliance on interconnected networks makes them vulnerable to cyberattacks. Using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C), the framework dynamically detects, mitigates, and responds to cyber threats in a simulated AIM environment. Tested in a digital-twin intersection simulation, the RL agents effectively balanced traffic efficiency and security, handling threats like denial of service (DoS) attacks, data manipulation, and malware.Looking ahead, this framework sets the stage for scalable and adaptive cybersecurity solutions in intelligent transportation systems. It highlights RL’s potential to create resilient systems that evolve with emerging threats and emphasizes the value of explainable AI for transparency and trust. Future research can explore hybrid learning models, real-world datasets, and collaborations to establish robust security standards for AIM systems. This work underscores RL’s transformative potential to secure AIM systems and advance cybersecurity in transportation and critical infrastructure.

AB  - As a key technology of intelligent transportation system, the intelligent vehicle is the carrier of comprehensive integration of many technologies. Although vision-based autonomous driving has shown excellent prospects, there is still a problem of how to analyze the complicated traffic situation by the collected data. Recently, autonomous driving has been formulated as many tasks separately by using different models, such as object detection task and intention recognition task. In this study, a vision-based system was developed to detect and identity various objects and predict the intention of pedestrians in the traffic scene. The main contributions of this research are (1) an optimized model was presented to detect 10 kinds of objects based on the structure of YOLOv4; (2) a fine-tuned Part Affinity Fields approach was proposed to estimate the pose of pedestrians; (3) Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) technology is added to explain and assist the estimation results in the risk assessment phase; (4) an elaborate self-driving dataset that includes several different subsets for each corresponding task was introduced; and (5) an end-to-end system containing multiple models with high accuracy was developed. Experimental results proved that the total parameters of optimized YOLOv4 are reduced by 74%, which satisfies the real-time capability. In addition, the detection precision of the optimized YOLOv4 achieved an improvement of 2.6% compared to the state-of-the-art.

AB  - The democratic welfare government is equally committed to quality-driven, impartial, and egalitarian education. The major contribution of this study is to examine the problems and opportunities posed by the incorporation of digital technology in the classroom via the lens of Classroom 4.0 (CLSR4) and education 4.0. The commitment of the democratic welfare government to equitable and quality education is investigated, in line with the Global Agenda SDG 4 goal of ensuring comprehensive and lifelong education for everyone. The modern classroom is witnessing a clash between traditional teaching methods and the digital competency of today’s tech-savvy generation. The goal of this study is to examine the connections between education 4.0 and classroom 4.0 by looking at developments in classroom architecture and the use of digital platforms. The biggest issue found is instructors’ inability to adjust to changing conditions. In terms of methodology, confirmatory factor analysis is used in this work to investigate the dynamics of correlations in the context of Classroom 4.0. This method offers insights into the variables influenced by metaverse technology, resulting in a thorough comprehension of the evolving educational scene. This study’s findings shed insight into how students see the changing classroom and the role that various platforms play in engaging them. The study underscores the need for educators to effectively integrate these tools and address this digital transformation to improve teaching and learning experiences. However, there are study constraints, most notably the limited contextual scope, which is exclusively focused on the Indian educational setting. Further research in other worldwide contexts is required to generalize the findings. In the future, it is critical to investigate and build creative instructional practices that effectively synergize with Classroom 4.0. Furthermore, further research should be conducted to determine how governments and educational institutions might adapt to this paradigm shift, ensuring a smooth and effective transition into the digital era of education.

AB  - As electricity systems evolve in the light of increased volatility and market variety, understanding market dynamics through simulations becomes crucial. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in combination with agent-based models (ABM) progressively garners attention as it allows the modeling of strategic bidding behavior of electricity market participants. However, as DRL is a black-box model, the learned behavior of market participants is hardly explainable nor interpretable for modelers. We bridge the gap in explainability of DRL in agentbased electricity market simulations by leveraging explainable DRL methods. The reviewed literature underscores the novelty of this approach, especially in multi-agent DRL settings. A case study comparing DRL and rule-based bidding strategies within the German electricity market showcases our method's potential. By analyzing DRL bidding strategies of 118 competitive DRL agents with clustering approaches and DeepSHAP, we investigate the underlying factors driving agent decisions, contributing to the development of transparent ABMs.

AB  - The Loess Plateau (LP), with an area of 6.4 × 105 km2, has experienced numerous landslides triggered by earthquakes, rainfall, and anthropogenic activities for long history. However, it still lacks a comprehensive investigation on both the spatial distribution and inherent influencing factors of potential landslides across the entire LP due to its vast extension, active tectonic movement, diverse geomorphic types, and climate variations. We first apply interferometric synthetic aperture radar technology to identify 2052 potential landslides across the LP, which exhibit three landslide concentrated zones. Then, we adopt XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) to model the effects of topographic, geomorphic, geological, hydrological factors on the landslides, and SHAP (Shapley additive explanation) algorithm to boost the interpretability and diaphaneity of modeling process. Considering the spatial differentiation of influencing factors for a wide area, we compare the patterns revealed by whole region modeling and subregion modeling. The results indicate that the subregion modeling is superior to whole region modeling, especially in revealing the distribution patterns of influencing factors with spatial heterogeneity. The influencing factors can be divided into two categories, those with spatial heterogeneity (i.e., elevation, fault, and road) and those without spatial heterogeneity (i.e., rain, river, and NDVI). The subregion modeling results indicate that rainfall has the greatest contribution to landslide development in all zones, and fault, NDVI and elevation are the subdominant factors in three zones, respectively. These findings can provide a reference framework for landslide detection and influencing factors analysis over large area.

AB  - The research presents a comprehensive framework that integrates spatio-temporal techniques with machine learning algorithms to compare crime rates in urban and rural areas. This framework employs hybrid algorithms, including neural networks, decision trees, and ensemble approaches, to analyze the complex relationship between geographic distribution and crime patterns. By leveraging diverse geo-spatial data from satellite imagery, census reports, and crime statistics, the framework uncovers meaningful correlations that enable accurate crime rate predictions. Advanced machine learning models provide precise crime hotspot detection with an 88% accuracy rate and urban growth predictions with a 92% success rate, showcasing robust analytical capabilities for crime trend assessment in both settings. Experimental evaluations on real-world data from metropolitan and rural regions validate the framework's reliability and scalability. The combination of spatio-temporal analysis with interconnected datasets ensures applicability to both urban and rural safety management. Designed to offer actionable insights, this framework supports policymakers and law enforcement agencies in implementing targeted crime prevention strategies tailored to urban and rural contexts. The study emphasizes how modern crime analysis and urban planning rely on spatio-temporal and machine learning methodologies to enhance public safety and resource allocation. Through scalable, data-driven solutions, this framework serves as a transformative tool for developing safer and more sustainable communities, bridging the gap between urban and rural crime dynamics.

AB  - The determination of criteria weights is known to be a challenging and complex issue, particularly for the Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problems involved in the assessment of Cyber Physical Power Systems (CPPS). Traditionally, assessment methodologies for CPPS have often leveraged a Multi-Index Assessment Framework (MIAF) approach, whose involved MCDM problems have various competing objectives and/or attributes that need to be optimized concurrently; yet, the utilized Adaptive Weighting Methodologies (AWM) have often been beset with selection bias (e.g., particular indices utilized, heuristics formulated, parameters selected, etc). The selection bias issue has been compounded even further when the utilized Artificial Intelligence (AI) decision-support mechanisms also have inherent selection bias; this phenomenon has contributed to the Explainable AI (XAI) movement. This paper’s mitigation approach is two-pronged. First, a mitigation approach to the AWM selection bias centers upon the use of an AWM that considers/hybridizes various subjective and objective approaches. For example, a bespoke Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)-CRiteria Importance through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) et al. hybridized construct (C#1) conjoined with a bespoke R-Fuzzy Set (RFS), Adaptation of the Grey Relational Analysis (AGRA), and New Normalized Projection Entropy Weighting Model (NNP-EWM) et al. construct (C#2) can reduce the AWM selection bias. Along with AGRA, C#2 can leverage Type-2 Fuzzy Sets (T2FS) and Spherical Fuzzy Set (SFS) AWM-derived entropy weights to support C#1. This paper further facilitates the C#1 and C#2 constructs with an Extended Matrix Shanks Transformation Accelerant (EMSTA). Second, a mitigation approach to the involved AI selection bias is to leverage a bespoke AWM Support Layer (ASL) in the form of a Particle Swarm Optimization-based Robust Convex Relaxation (PSO-RCR) pseudo-white-box construct, which operationalizes the tightest possible relaxation for the involved successive neural network convolutional layers (which contain the cascading of ever-smaller Continuous Wavelet Transform-like convolutional filters). Hence, both the AWM and AI selection bias are reduced, and a principal contribution of this paper is the enhanced efficacy of the MIAF for use with CPPS, particularly those which are potentially vulnerable to a Sequential Topology Attack (STA) effectuated by an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Insider Threat Paradigm (ITP). Preliminary results indicate that the C#1 and C#2 amalgam has high efficacy, and the performance, numerical stability, and consistency of the results — when leveraging EMSTA — is promising.

AB  - Soybean is a crucial agricultural crop, but its productivity is significantly affected by leaf diseases such as Bacterial Blight, Downy Mildew, Septoria Brown Spot, Cercospora Leaf Spot, and Anthracnose. Traditional disease detection methods are time-consuming and subjective, necessitating an automated, accurate, and real-time solution. This study proposes a hybrid CNN-LSTM deep learning model that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for spatial feature extraction with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for sequential learning, enhancing disease classification performance. The model is trained on a dataset of 14,950 soybean leaf images, where 70% is used for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. Experimental results demonstrate that the CNN-LSTM model achieves an overall accuracy of 92.6%, outperforming standalone CNN (88.2%) and LSTM (85.3%) models, as well as traditional machine learning classifiers such as Support Vector Machines (76.8%) and Random Forest (81.2%). The ROC-AUC score of 0.96 indicates strong class separability, while class-wise analysis shows Healthy Leaves achieving 97.8% accuracy and Anthracnose reaching 94.3% precision. The model’s efficiency is validated with an inference time of 48 milliseconds per image, making it feasible for real-time smart agriculture deployment. Furthermore, Grad-CAM and SHAP-based explainability techniques confirm that the model focuses on disease-relevant leaf regions, ensuring transparency and interpretability.

AB  - Compared to the generations up to 4G, whose main focus was on broadband and coverage aspects, 5G has expanded the scope of wireless cellular systems toward embracing two new types of connectivity: massive machine-type communications (mMTCs) and ultrareliable low-latency communications (URLLCs). This article discusses the possible evolution of these two types of connectivity within the umbrella of 6G wireless systems. This article consists of three parts. The first part deals with the connectivity for a massive number of devices. While mMTC research in 5G predominantly focuses on the problem of uncoordinated access in the uplink for a large number of devices, the traffic patterns in 6G may become more symmetric, leading to closed-loop massive connectivity. One of the drivers for this type of traffic pattern is distributed/decentralized learning and inference. The second part of this article discusses the evolution of wireless connectivity for critical services. While latency and reliability are tightly coupled in 5G, 6G will support a variety of safety-critical control applications with different types of timing requirements, as evidenced by the emergence of metrics related to information freshness and information value. In addition, ensuring ultrahigh reliability for safety-critical control applications requires modeling and estimation of the tail statistics of the wireless channel, queue length, and delay. The fulfillment of these stringent requirements calls for the development of novel artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques, incorporating optimization theory, explainable AI (XAI), generative AI, and digital twins (DTs). The third part analyzes the coexistence of massive connectivity and critical services. Specifically, we consider scenarios in which a massive number of devices need to support traffic patterns of mixed criticality. This is followed by a discussion about the management of wireless resources shared by services with different criticality.

AB  - In the realm of smart manufacturing, Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) play a critical role in supervising essential operations across various manufacturing facilities. As ICSs become increasingly integral to critical infrastructure, their susceptibility to cyber threats escalates. Despite the positive impact of abundant digital data communication on ICS performance, rising concerns about data security underscore the pivotal role of intrusion detection systems (IDS) in averting the consequences of network security attacks. However, challenges persist, particularly in the detection of zero-day attacks. Furthermore, while many IDSs exhibit high performance for known attack patterns, they often function as black boxes, presenting interpretability challenges for network operators to take appropriate actions. This paper introduces a novel zero-day intrusion detection system, thoughtfully crafted to address the interdependence within ICS network traffic. Our approach designs a multi-head-attention mechanism, not only for precise classification of network traffic but also to mitigate zero-day attacks. Subsequently, we incorporate a novel autoencoder architecture, purposefully designed to capture distinctive patterns present in both known attacks and normal traffic, leveraging the output from the attention layer. Furthermore, our approach integrates Explainable Artificial Intelligence mechanisms, employing the multi-head attentions model to offer a more detailed description of the underlying process involved in traffic categorization. The model’s efficacy is demonstrated through experiments conducted using water system ICS testbeds, underscoring its performance and reliability in detecting diverse cyber-attacks and inferring zero-day attacks with an accuracy surpassing 89%, while also providing interpretable results.

AB  - Prior studies have shown the importance of classroom dialogue in academic performance, through which knowledge construction and social interaction among students take place. However, most of them were based on small scale or qualitative data, and few has explored the availability and potential of big data collected from online classrooms. To address this issue, this paper analyzes dialogues in live classrooms of a large online learning platform in China based on natural language processing techniques. The features of interactive types and emotional expression are extracted from classroom dialogues. We then develop neural network models based on these features to predict high- and low-academic performing students, and employ interpretable AI (artificial intelligence) techniques to determine the most important predictors in the prediction models. In both STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) and non-STEM courses, it is found that high-performing students consistently exhibit more positive emotion, cognition and off-topic dialogues in all stages of the lesson than low-performing students. However, while the metacognitive dialogue illustrates its importance in non-STEM courses, this effect cannot be found in STEM courses. While high-performing students in non-STEM courses show negative emotion in the last stage of lessons, STEM students show positive emotion.

AB  - Machine learning (ML)-based models are often black box, making it challenging to understand and interpret their decision-making processes. Surrogate models are constructed to approximate the behavior of a target model and are an essential tool for analyzing black-box models. The construction of a surrogate model typically includes querying the target model with carefully selected data points and using the responses from the target model to infer information about its structure and parameters.In this paper, we propose an approach to surrogate model construction using combinatorial testing and active learning, aiming to efficiently capture the essential interactions between features that drive the target model’s predictions. Our approach first leverages t-way testing to generate data points that capture all the t-way feature interactions. We then use an iterative process to isolate the essential feature interactions, i.e., those that can determine a model prediction. In the iterative process, we remove nonessential feature interactions, generate additional data points to contain the remaining interactions, and employ active learning techniques to select a subset of the data points to update the surrogate model. This process is continued until we construct a surrogate model that closely mirrors the target model’s behavior. We evaluate our approach on 4 public datasets and 12 ML models and compare the results with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. Our experimental results show that our approach can perform in most cases better than the SOTA approaches in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

AB  - Fuzzy integral fusion has been shown as an effective tool for enhancing classification accuracy while also achieving explainability. With the deep learning boom in the past decade, many researchers have investigated the advantages of fusing various deep neural networks (DNNs) with fuzzy integral techniques in computer vision. However, recent studies focus on only the explainable fusion process. Thus, features learned by each DNN are difficult to understand. Moreover, DNNs are usually trained on the ImageNet dataset, whereas the effectiveness of applying the fuzzy integral methods to this dataset is yet to be investigated. This is the gap that motivates our research study. To address this issue, we explore fuzzy integral fusion classification models that make both the fusion process and extracted features explainable. Specifically, we use two well-known fuzzy integral fusion methods [i.e., Sugeno integral (SI) and Choquet integral (ChI)] to combine three explainable deep learning features (i.e., shape, texture, and color) in a manner that mimics the human visual recognition process. The originality of our work includes the emphasis on complete explainability in the classification process, the investigation of applying fuzzy integral methods to the ImageNet dataset, and extensive experimental validation of the effectiveness of fuzzy integral. Computational experiments show that fuzzy integral fusion can improve classification accuracy by 14.6% compared with an individual DNN on subsets derived from the ImageNet dataset. Furthermore, fuzzy integral fusion helps understand contributions, relationships, and interactions among the three features (shape, texture, and color) for each class, providing convincing evidence for the final classification result. Consequently, the proposed models not only achieve impressive performance, but also provide a thorough understanding of how these models work.

AB  - The Indian options market and in particular, the National Stock Exchange (NSE) segment of this marketspace poses a number of challenges when it comes to pricing option trades under high volatility regimes, low liquidity environments as driven by retail volume traders/ long positions and also rapidly changing regulatory ecosystems amongst others. These dynamics are often not captured by traditional pricing models such as the Black-Scholes model, therefore leading to inefficiencies in their prices. Deep learning, which can capture the non-linearities in data and handle quite a large set of features backed by parallel processing power promises to fill that void. There are several factors that any valid pricing model will have to take into account. These factors are underlying asset, strike price, time to expiration, volatility, interest rates, expected dividends and still there is a lot need in order to be able simulate option prices. which then encompass their significance when pricing an option. Furthermore, given their ability to integrate real-time market data (incorporating the India VIX), liquidity measures and economic indicators, these models can tackle some of the shortcomings that plague conventional methodologies. The other ultimate tools to achieve this goal are Option Greeks which plays a very important role in Options Pricing & Risk Management. This paper presents a detailed literature review of latest deep learning architectures applied on option pricing. This study addresses these issues while also bringing novel contributions to an important area of research that has not received attention yet, e.g., market specific models nuanced with the Indian scenario and necessity for a hybrid deep learning approach combining state-of-the-art volatility forecasting alongside data driven methods.

AB  - Physical injuries induced by lifting are commonly reported in the workplace. Early risk detection is essential for reducing lifting injuries but requires trained observers to perform assessments manually. Machine learning and computer vision techniques have been proposed to aid ergonomists in lifting risk assessments. However, these methods may not bring the practitioners into the decision-making process and frequently not interpretable to practitioners. We conducted a user study with a proposed risk assessment system that consists of a prediction module, explanation module, and prototype user interface. The prediction module consists of a logistics regression model capable of distinguishing the injury risk levels induced by different levels of force exertion in common lifting tasks. The logistics regression model makes predictions based on explainable body motion, posture, and facial features extracted through computer vision techniques. The explanation module makes up of explainable AI techniques. Specifically, a surrogate model provides local explanations for presenting how the system makes each prediction to users. The prototype interface presents the system’s predictions and explanations. A usability study shows that the proposed system increases crowd-workers’ and domain scholars’ performance in assessing workers’ injury risks in lifting. Furthermore, the usability study also shows that the proposed system increases their confidence in the assessment tasks when the system’s evaluations agree with their subjective evaluations.

AB  - There has been a meteoric rise in the application of AI during the past decade. Researchers are looking into using AI algorithms in almost every domain. AI algorithms are being used in modern agricultural research and practices for a variety of tasks, from quality control to increasing agricultural production. Using Deep Learning algorithms can be difficult because of their heuristic character. Class Activation based approaches like CAM and Gradient based CAM have emerged and greatly improved the model's explainability. In this paper we have classified rice grain based on their images and showed that the convolutional neural networks capture the shape of these grains for the classification task based on their quality whereas researchers have use morphological based features for classifying the rice grains based on their quality. We have used Grad-CAM, to show that the CNN captures the shape of the rice grains. We have explored state of the art CNN architectures like AlexNet, ResNet18 and VGG-16 along with a four convolutional layer CNN for the work. We show how the Grad-CAM localizes the shape of the various rice grains and the class for which it fails.

AB  - The broader ambition of this article is to popularize an approach for the fair distribution of the quantity of a system's output to its subsystems while allowing for underlying complex subsystem level interactions. Particularly, we present the use of this framework on a very specific (but generalizable) application, interesting for a more general AI audience. We detail a data-driven approach to vehicle price modeling and its component price estimation by leveraging a combination of concepts from machine learning and game theory. We show an alternative to common teardown methodologies and surveying approaches for component and vehicle price estimation at the manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) level that has the advantage of bypassing uncertainties involved in gathering teardown data, the need to perform expensive and biased surveying, and the need to perform retail price equivalent or indirect cost multiplier adjustments to mark up direct manufacturing costs to MSRP. This novel exercise not only provides accurate pricing of the technologies at the customer level, but also shows the, a priori known, large gaps in pricing strategies between manufacturers, vehicle classes, market segments, etc. There is also clear interaction between the price of technologies and other specifications present in vehicles. Those results are indication that old methods of manufacturer-level component costing, aggregation, and application of flat and rigid adjustment factors should be carefully examined. The findings are based on a database developed by Argonne, which includes over 64 000 vehicles covering MY1990 to MY2020 with hundreds of vehicle specs.

This program is seen as important for AI adoption, in this case to include the needs of warfighters to effectively collaborate with AI “partners.” Technology adoption is often promoted based on beliefs, which bears little relationship to the benefit a technology will provide. These beliefs include “progress,” technology superiority, and technology as cornucopia. The XAI program has widely promoted a new belief: that AI is in general explainable. As AI systems often have concealed or black box characteristics, the problem of explainability is significant. This paper argues that due to their complexity, AI systems should be approached in a way similar to the way the scientific method is used to approach natural phenomena. One approach encouraged by DARPA, model induction, is based on post-hoc reasoning. Such inductive reasoning is consistent with the scientific method. However, that method has a history of controls that are applied to create confidence in an uncertain, inductive, outcome. The paper proposes some controls consistent with a philosophical examination of black boxes. As AI systems are being used to determine who should have access to scarce resources and who should be punished and in what way, the claim that AI can be explained is important. Widespread recent experimentation with ChatGPT has also highlighted the challenges and expectations of AI systems.

AB  - Employee turnover is one of the central facets of personnel management that can affect organizational performance significantly. In this study, the author discusses the use of artificial neural networks to point out the possibility of employee turnover and the way to improve the retention rate as well. To address the research questions posed by this investigation, the study acquires and integrates several features that are demographic, job-related, performance-related, and engagement-related data of a large organization. The approach entails data preparation analysis, model creation, and assessment by utilization of a multi-layered pattern neural network. The analysis reveals that the deep learning model achieves superior predictive performance to conventional ML models including logistic regression and decision trees concerning identifying employee turnover. To be precise, for the model based on the structure of a neural network, the efficiency was tested with 91% accuracy, 89% of precision, 86% of recall, and 87% of the F1-score. Importantly, the results presented above demonstrate that the model developed in the current research is highly useful in everyday practice, particularly in terms of accurately identifying employees at risk for turnover to the organization. Such insights into the subject contribute to understanding the ability of deep learning to revolutionize HRM, as it offers more accurate insights into the behavior of employees. Using such enhancements in the course of predictive analytics, HR professionals are capable of enhancing interventions together with proactive retention mechanisms which in turn leads to low rates of turnover costs and foster productivity of qualified workforce. The given research adds to the knowledge in the area of predictive analytics in the context of HRM and paves the way for the development of further research in the field.

AB  - Pathogen control is a critical aspect of modern poultry farming, providing important benefits for both public health and productivity. Effective poultry management measures to reduce pathogen levels in poultry flocks promote food safety by lowering risks of food-borne illnesses. They also support animal health and welfare by preventing infectious diseases that can rapidly spread and impact flock growth, egg production, and overall health. This study frames the search for optimal management practices that minimize the presence of multiple pathogens as a combinatorial optimization problem. Specifically, we model the various possible combinations of management settings as a solution space that can be efficiently explored to identify configurations that optimally reduce pathogen levels. This design incorporates a neural network feedback-based method that combines feature explanations with global sensitivity analysis to ensure combinatorial optimization in multiobjective settings. Our preliminary experiments have promising results when applied to two real-world agricultural datasets. While further validation is still needed, these early experimental findings demonstrate the potential of the model to derive targeted feature interactions that adaptively optimize pathogen control under varying real-world constraints.

AB  - Interpretability of machine learning (ML) models represents the extent to which a model’s decision-making process can be understood by model developers and/or end users. Transcriptomics-based cancer prognosis models, for example, while achieving good accuracy, are usually hard to interpret, due to the high-dimensional feature space and the complexity of models. As interpretability is critical for the transparency and fairness of ML models, several algorithms have been proposed to improve the interpretability of arbitrary classifiers. However, evaluation of these algorithms often requires substantial domain knowledge. Here, we propose a breast cancer metastasis prediction model using a very small number of biologically interpretable features, and a simple yet novel model interpretation approach that can provide personalized interpretations. In addition, we contributed, to the best of our knowledge, the first method to quantitatively compare different interpretation algorithms. Experimental results show that our model not only achieved competitive prediction accuracy, but also higher inter-classifier interpretation consistency than state-of-the-art interpretation methods. Importantly, our interpretation results can improve the generalizability of the prediction models. Overall, this work provides several novel ideas to construct and evaluate interpretable ML models that can be valuable to both the cancer machine learning community and related application domains.

AB  - Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) communication underpins intelligent transportation systems but remains susceptible to spoofing attacks that inject false information, compromising safety and reliability. While traditional cryptographic security verifies sender credentials, it cannot assure the veracity of message content if credentials are compromised. Physical Layer Security (PLS) provides a complementary defense by analyzing inherent wireless signal characteristics. This paper details the implementation and simulation of an SDR-DL (Software-Defined Radio and Deep Learning) framework for C-V2X spoofing detection, inspired by recent research. The Pythonbased simulation, utilizing TensorFlow/Keras for the Position-Change Detector (PCD) and PyTorch Geometric for the Graph Neural Network (GNN), demonstrates the framework’s feasibility, achieving high detection accuracy for the modeled spoofing scenarios based on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) patterns. We discuss implementation details, highlight challenges including data requirements and computational complexity, and propose future research directions such as multi-feature fusion and explainable AI integration.

EnDL-Migrate represents an Ensembled Transformer-XGBoost Framework which identifies and predicts labor rights violations in Thiruvalluvar District’s Construction Industry. EnDL-Migrate uses Transformer-based NLP models to handle labor law analysis and legal case reports in combination with structured socioeconomic data analysis through XGBoost-based predictive analytics. An extensive dataset received training while incorporating three interpretability enhancements through categorical encoding and feature scaling alongside legal policy embeddings. Experimental testing establishes that EnDL-Migrate obtains 97.69% accuracy which exceeds baseline performance levels of Logistic Regression (85.32%) and Random Forest (91.47%) and SVM (89.21%). SHAP analysis determines wage disparities, contract enforcement and workplace safety ratings as the most influential factors which affect labor rights. The developed system offers an advanced AI platform which helps monitor legal compliance and generates recommendations alongside providing support tools for decision-making stakeholders. The explainable AI approach of EnDL-Migrate pushes transformative changes to labor rights protection while supporting data-based developments of legal reforms. Future investigations concentrate on broadening the model across various industries and integrating real-time legal updates as well as refining model generalization by using federated learning methods.

AB  - Summary <p>AI systems rely on vast amounts of data to train effectively, which can raise concerns about data collection, storage, and usage. One of the primary concerns is the lack of transparency in how AI systems collect and use personal data. Striking the right balance between encouraging innovation in AI and ensuring its responsible development and use is crucial for regulations to be accepted by all parties. This chapter looks at how AI may spill over our current established ethical and safety standards and which new challenges they bring up. It discusses two areas that illustrate specific regulations that will be needed: military weapons and finance. Ethics and accountability come into play when we bring AI into the realm of military applications. In finance, AI regulation aims to address challenges related to algorithmic trading, risk management, and consumer protection. Transparency and explainability take center stage in AI regulation for the finance sector.</p>

AB  - This paper, for the very first time, introduces human sketches to the landscape of XAI (Explainable Artificial Intelligence). We argue that sketch as a “human-centred” data form, represents a natural interface to study explainability. We focus on cultivating sketch-specific explainability designs. This starts by identifying strokes as a unique building block that offers a degree of flexibility in object construction and manipulation impossible in photos. Following this, we design a simple explainability-friendly sketch encoder that accommodates the intrinsic properties of strokes: shape, location, and order. We then move on to define the first ever XAI task for sketch, that of stroke location inversion (SLI). Just as we have heat maps for photos, and correlation matrices for text, SLI offers an explainability angle to sketch in terms of asking a network how well it can recover stroke locations of an unseen sketch. We offer qualitative results for readers to interpret as snapshots of the SLI process in the paper, and as GIFs on the project page. A minor but interesting note is that thanks to its sketch-specific design, our sketch encoder also yields the best sketch recognition accuracy to date while having the smallest number of parameters. The code is available at https://sketchxai.github.io.

AB  - Meteorological conditions have a strong influence on air quality and can play an important role in air quality prediction. However, due to the “black-box” nature of deep learning, it is difficult to obtain trustworthy deep learning models when considering meteorological conditions in air quality prediction. To address the above problem, in this paper, we reveal the influence of meteorological conditions on air quality prediction by utilizing explainable deep learning. In this paper, (1) the source data from air pollutant datasets, including PM2.5, PM10, SO2 hourly concentration, and the meteorological condition datasets measuring the temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure are obtained; (2) the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models are established for air quality prediction in 4 conditions; (3) the SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method is employed to analyze the explainability of the air quality prediction models. We find that the prediction accuracy is not improved by considering only meteorological conditions. However, when combining meteorological conditions with other air pollutants, the prediction accuracy is higher than considering other air pollutants. In addition, the largest contribution to air quality prediction is atmospheric pressure, followed by humidity and temperature. The reason for the different accuracies of the prediction may because of the interaction between meteorological conditions and other air pollutants. The investigated results in this paper can help improve the prediction accuracy of air quality and achieve trusted air quality predictions.

All these circumstances generate significant risk factors that drastically influence peoples' bad health status and conditions.On the other hand, in a lot of, even highly developed countries, health and medical support is getting more and more limited and out of normal working conditions due to different reasons.So, a very important question in this highly technologically developed society is if and how information communication technologies, artificial intelligence, and virtual agent technologies can help in changing and improving the current situation.One important scientific and research direction is oriented towards the development of high quality and reliable personalized medical and health services. The development of sophisticated, intelligent virtual agents i.e. a specific kind of medical e-coaching can help people in getting adequate advices and recommendations in order to improve their health conditions and quality of key life indicators.The use of agents in personalized and social medical and health platforms can open new possibilities for producing tailored recommendations during human-intelligent virtual agents' conversation and support. Some opportunities and challenges of human-agent communication are considered in order to increase human living and health conditions. Several paradigmatic cases of intelligent virtual agents are presented and challenges for future development.

AB  - Traditional wireless network design relies on optimization algorithms derived from domain-specific mathematical models, which are often inefficient and unsuitable for dynamic, real-time applications due to high complexity. Deep learning has emerged as a promising alternative to overcome complexity and adaptability concerns, but it faces challenges such as accuracy issues, delays, and limited interpretability due to its inherent black-box nature. This article introduces a novel approach that integrates optimization theory with deep learning methodologies to address these issues. The methodology starts by constructing the block diagram of the optimization theory-based solution, identifying key building blocks corresponding to optimality conditions and iterative solutions. Selected building blocks are then replaced with deep neural networks, enhancing the adaptability and interpretability of the system. Extensive simulations show that this hybrid approach not only reduces runtime compared to optimization theory based approaches, but also significantly improves accuracy and convergence rates, outperforming pure deep learning models.

AB  - The growing demand for deploying deep learning (DL) models for cyber-attack detection on consumer devices is constrained by their limited memory and computational resources. High-performing DL models are often too resource-intensive for on-device deployment. Knowledge distillation (KD) offers an alternative by transferring knowledge from a complex teacher model to a smaller, lightweight student model, reducing model size and inference time with minimal accuracy loss. In this paper, a KD-based framework is utilized to design and train both teacher and student models for intrusion detection using the N-BaIoT and CIC-IDS 2023 datasets. The student model achieves comparable performance to the teacher, with accuracies of 99.87% and 98.71% on the utilized datasets. It maintains accurate classification across various attack classes, achieving F1-scores above 0.98, while reducing computational complexity from 263k to 120k trainable parameters, model size from 1.00 MB to 471.67 KB, and inference time from 48 ms to 34 ms. Moreover, SHAP-based explainable AI techniques are employed to interpret both models, demonstrating that the distilled student model retains key feature attributions of the teacher model.

AB  - This study combines the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network with Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation (LIME) to enhance both predictive accuracy and interpretability in financial risk assessment, specifically loan default prediction. For instance, considering the ability of LSTM neural networks to capture temporal dynamics and long-range dependencies in data, they can excel with tasks such as credit risk prediction in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending platforms. Nonetheless, a common criticism of LSTMs is that they are too much like a “black box” because it can be hard to interpret how the model came up with an output. This is limited to a black box for selfinterpretation and by means of LIME we tackle this providing insights into the model decision by highlighting key features like loan amount, interest rate and annual income. The LSTM model was also successful with a training accuracy of 0.89 and testing accuracy of 0.85, ensuring precision, recall, and $F 1$-scores which closely corresponded to each other. LIME was employed to clarify individual predictions and improve trust and transparency in AIdriven financial decision-making. A hybrid method that employs the prediction strength of LSTM with the interpretability of LIME provides a more transparent and interpretable tool to financial institutions in assessing loan default risks. In addition, the conclusions drawn in this study may be quite helpful for enhancing credit risk models and adoption processes of financial sector. This in turn lends credence to the pragmatic portability of this methodology across other financial products, like credit cards and mortgages. Finally, we discuss the potential for real-time deployment, future research directions, and limitations, including computational complexity and dataset specificity.

AB  - Abnormal financial data detection in companies is very important to secure financial stability, avoid fraud, and uphold conformity to regulatory requirements. Conventional auditing procedures based on rule systems and manual inspections tend to be labor-intensive, prone to error, and less capable of capturing sophisticated financial irregularities. This research therefore advocates for an intelligent mining approach with association rule algorithms to identify unusual financial patterns automatically. The suggested model uses large-scale enterprise financial data to unveil concealed correlations, identify fraudulent transactions, and pinpoint unusual financial behaviors. The system improves financial risk assessment and fraud detection with high precision using advanced data mining methodologies. Experimental findings on actual financial datasets indicate that the suggested approach has a classification accuracy of 96%, surpassing traditional methods in detecting financial anomalies with enhanced precision and recall. This paper presents a scalable and adaptive enterprise financial anomaly detection solution that supports improved financial transparency and risk reduction.

Generative AI, beyond the breakthroughs associated with large language models or foundational models, has popularized and made entirely new populations aware of and comfortable with conversational interfaces. It has provided an accessible path to encoding a significant portion of the information available on the internet in one model. Causal discovery is intended to expose the underlying causal structure that generated the data. This can be useful for prediction, decision&#x2010;making, and understanding the mechanisms underlying a system. In the future, reinforcement learning will become an important tool to support causal AI. Probabilistic Programming Languages are used to create flexible causal models. These languages are designed to help develop and test causal AI algorithms.</p>

AB  - The Control Room plays a central role in the operation and supervision of the Fuel Handling System in CANDU-600 nuclear reactor, being responsible for critical decision-making during system exploitation. The current state of the workforce and the limited number of highly trained personnel in this field highlight the need to optimize and simplify operator workload by developing systems capable of taking over parts of their tasks. Romania must develop new electricity generation capacities to support the transition toward a low-carbon economy while ensuring stability, security, and availability within the National Energy System, as well as generating socio-economic benefits. The completion of Units 3 and 4 Project at the Cernavodă Nuclear Power Plant is positioned to deliver these outcomes. This paper aims to explore new solutions for improving the Human-Machine Interaction in Fuel Handling Systems by investigating the implementation of modern display, data acquisition, and control systems suitable for use in the Fuelling Machine Testing Rig located in the Institute for Nuclear Research Pitești. This work addresses the selection of relevant design requirements and standards for nuclear Human-Machine Interfaces, the identification of operational issues encountered in the Control Room, the proposal of improvement solutions, as well as the definition of objectives, while considering the necessity of preparing and optimizing the testing facility for the acceptance and pre-acceptance tests of the Fuelling Machines for Units 3 and 4.

AB  - In the production process of hot-rolled strip steel plate, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) improves the quality and efficiency of production and manufacturing products, but also because of the large amount of data generated by its equipment, resulting in a significant decline in plate crown fault diagnosis and decision-making ability. To improve the yield and quality of hot strip steel plate, in this article, an intelligent algorithm based on the hippopotamus optimization algorithm-kernel extreme learning machine (HOA-KELM) is proposed. Adaptive synthetic sampling technology (ADASYN) resampling technique is used to deal with multiclass unbalance of data. At the same time, InterpretML and SHapley additive stripping (SHAP) methods based on game theory were introduced to analyze the crown diagnosis model of hot strip, and the influencing factors of the strip in hot rolling were studied. To verify the applicability of the model, the model was tested on the hot rolling production dataset and UCI dataset. In the hot rolling dataset, the model performance Kappa Coefficient, F1 Score, and Accuracy were 0.988, 0.993, and 0.992, respectively, indicating a good effect. It is compared with the common mathematical model. The findings indicate that this model significantly outperforms the conventional approach in solving the problem of strip convexity diagnosis in the hot rolling process, and can be proposed as an effective mathematical model for plate convexity diagnosis to realize the intelligent management of industrial production.

By embedding a class token into the input feature sequence and leveraging a novel multi-head attention mechanism, this model captures both local and global image features, leading to a significant enhancement in diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Our approach involves a meticulous configuration process that adjusts hyperparameters such as the number of transformer encoder layers and attention heads to optimize performance. Rigorous testing on a meticulously curated and pre-augmented dataset underscores the model’s superiority over existing methodologies, demonstrating its readiness for real-world agricultural applications.

AB  - Intelligent algorithms through the recent developments of Artificial Intelligence (AI) are making enormous progress in providing intelligence to the decision-making process for space vehicles descending on the Moon. However, the trust in freely deploying them on space vehicles to increase their autonomy is still questionable by the most qualified scientists in the space domain. This paper therefore delves into explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for vision-based crater detection and navigation, to offer clear and comprehensible predictions to facilitate intelligent lunar landings. We incorporate an attention mechanism into the backbone architecture during the network construction phase, delivering an attention-enhanced Darknet53 (XAttDnet) for explainable feature extraction. Further, we replaced the XAttDnet with the backbone of YOLOv3 and developed the XAttDnet-LSTM models for crater detection and pose estimation tasks. Synthetic datasets generated by PANGU software are used to train and evaluate the proposed networks, showing competitive accuracy in detecting craters and estimating relative poses with RGB images-driven descent scenarios. The roles played by the different convolutional layers in concentrating and extracting features for two tasks are suggested by Visualising the attention maps of each trained convolutional layer. A quantitative assessment of the explainability is attempted by employing the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), which further reveals the evolution of the relationship among the feature extraction layers and inputs/outputs.

AB  - Previous studies in predicting crash risks primarily associated the number or likelihood of crashes on a road segment with traffic parameters or geometric characteristics, usually neglecting the impact of vehicles’ continuous movement and interactions with nearby vehicles. Recent technology advances, such as Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) and drones, are able to collect high-resolution trajectory data, which enable trajectory-based risk analysis. This study investigates a new vehicle group (VG) based risk analysis method and explores risk evolution mechanisms considering VG features. An impact-based vehicle grouping method is proposed to cluster vehicles into VGs by evaluating their responses to the erratic behaviors of nearby vehicles. The risk of a VG is aggregated based on the risk between each vehicle pair in the VG, measured by inverse Time-to-Collision (iTTC). Logistic Regression and a Graph Neural Network (GNN) are used to predict VG risks based on both aggregated and disaggregated VG information. Both methods achieve excellent performance with AUC values exceeding 0.93. For the GNN model, GNNExplainer with feature perturbation is applied to identify critical individual vehicle features and their directional impact on VG risks. Overall, this research contributes a new perspective for identifying, predicting, and interpreting traffic risks.

AB  - This study proposes the SS-XceVNet meta-architecture, which integrates Xception and VGG16 to detect structural peeling in rigid pavements in an automated manner, thereby reducing the reliance on large, labeled datasets. With increasing traffic and exposure to environmental factors, failures in rigid pavement joints and corners are becoming increasingly frequent, making manual inspections time consuming, dangerous, and subjective. To address this problem, a method was developed in four phases. First, photogrammetry and data augmentation techniques are used to collect and increase the variety of images. Self-supervised learning was then applied to unlabeled data to reduce reliance on manual annotations. SS-XceVNet was then trained on labeled data, combining the robustness of Xception and VGG16 to refine the accuracy. Finally, the results were compared with those of the XceVNet-based model. Evaluations showed that SS-XceVNet achieved 80.43% accuracy, surpassing 47.83% of the base model. This underscores the usefulness of self-supervised learning and integration of advanced architectures in pavement failure detection. In conclusion, this approach improves efficiency in the functional evaluation of road infrastructures while reducing costs and occupational risks, laying the foundation for future research that contributes to the implementation of proactive maintenance systems. Automated detection thus strengthens the quality control of pavements, favoring road safety, and prolonging the useful life of roads.

AB  - The problem of explaining learning considered in this paper is based on Vapnik’s learning machine model and is that of choosing from the given set of functions the one that best approximates the supervisor’s response. We define that family in the rigorous way using a set of partial differential equations. Such a formulation of the family of functions together with a risk functional allows to apply tools from optimal control theory. We build a new dynamic programming method to derive verification theorem for approximate solution to that new control problem. That approach to machine learning enables a construction of a numerical algorithm to compute a function which approximates supervisor set.

AB  - The prediction and identification of key factors in road traffic accidents are crucial for accident prevention, yet previous studies have often examined these aspects separately. To comprehensively assess the risk level of road traffic accidents and their key determinants, this paper proposes a comprehensive forecasting and analysis framework that offers a novel perspective for identifying key risk factors from a modeling standpoint compared to existing methods. The CNN-BiLSTM-Attention model was developed for predicting the risk value of road accidents, and DeepSHAP was employed to interpret the model and extract the key factors contributing to traffic accidents. This deep learning framework combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), while incorporating a spatial-temporal local attention mechanism to enhance its capability in capturing spatiotemporal features. Through analysis and experimentation on real-world datasets, our model demonstrates superior accuracy in predicting traffic accident risk compared to the benchmark model, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.2475 on the UK dataset and 0.2683 on the US dataset. The results obtained from DeepSHAP were found to be more rational and informative in identifying key factors of different severity levels using four methods. To verify the rationality and stability of obtaining these key factors, the first 15 factors were reintegrated into the prediction model, resulting in almost unchanged accuracy and reduced model iteration time. By improving the influential factors, road traffic accidents can be effectively mitigated.

AB  - The recent surge of interest in explainability in artificial intelligence (XAI) is propelled by not only technological advancements in machine learning but also by regulatory initiatives to foster transparency in algorithmic decision making. In this article, we revise the current concept of explainability and identify three limitations: passive explainee, narrow view on the social process, and undifferentiated assessment of explainee’s understanding. In order to overcome these limitations, we present explanation as a social practice in which explainer and explainee co-construct understanding on the microlevel. We view the co-construction on a microlevel as embedded into a macrolevel, yielding expectations concerning, e.g., social roles or partner models: typically, the role of the explainer is to provide an explanation and to adapt it to the current level of explainee’s understanding; the explainee, in turn, is expected to provide cues that direct the explainer. Building on explanations being a social practice, we present a conceptual framework that aims to guide future research in XAI. The framework relies on the key concepts of monitoring and scaffolding to capture the development of interaction. We relate our conceptual framework and our new perspective on explaining to transparency and autonomy as objectives considered for XAI.

AB  - The objective of this research is to present the state of the art of the safety assurance of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based systems and guidelines on future correlated work. For this purpose, a Systematic Literature Review comprising 5090 peer-reviewed references relating safety to AI has been carried out, with focus on a 329-reference subset in which the safety assurance of AI-based systems is directly conveyed. From 2016 onwards, the safety assurance of AI-based systems has experienced significant effervescence and leaned towards five main approaches: performing black-box testing, using safety envelopes, designing fail-safe AI, combining white-box analyses with explainable AI, and establishing a safety assurance process throughout systems’ lifecycles. Each of these approaches has been discussed in this paper, along with their features, pros and cons. Finally, guidelines for future research topics have also been presented. They result from an analysis based on both the cross-fertilization among the reviewed references and the authors’ experience with safety and AI. Among 15 research themes, these guidelines reinforce the need for deepening guidelines for the safety assurance of AI-based systems by, e.g., analyzing datasets from a safety perspective, designing explainable AI, setting and justifying AI hyperparameters, and assuring the safety of hardware-implemented AI-based systems.

AB  - Credit scoring has become an important risk management tool for money lending institutions. Over the years, statistical and classical machine learning models have been the most researched risk management tools in credit scoring literature, and recently the focus has turned to deep learning models. This transition is due to better performances that are shown by deep learning models in different domains. Despite deep learning models' superior performances, there is still a need for explaining how these models make their predictions. The non-transparency nature of deep learning models has created a bottleneck for their use in credit scoring. Explanations of decisions are important for lending institutions since it is a requirement for automated decisions that are generated by non-transparent models to be explained. The other issue in using deep learning models, specifically 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), in credit scoring is the need to have the data in image format. We propose an explainable deep learning model for credit scoring which can harness the performance benefits offered by deep learning and yet comply with the legislation requirements for the automated decision-making processes. The proposed method converts tabular datasets into images and thus allowing the application of 2D CNNs in credit scoring. Each pixel of the image corresponds to a feature bin of the tabular dataset. The predictions from the 2D CNNs were explained using state-of-the-art explanation methods. Furthermore, explanations were evaluated using a sanity check methodology and also performances of the explanation methods were compared quantitatively. The proposed explainable deep learning model outperforms the other credit scoring methods on publicly available credit scoring datasets.

AB  - We introduce the concept of an  $\varepsilon $ -semimetric that satisfies the same axioms as a topological metric, except for an arbitrarily small allowance to violate the triangle inequality. Under this modification, we demonstrate the possibility of taking arbitrary points in space, assigning arbitrary desired distances between them (independent of their geometric location relative to each other, that is, independent of their “features”), and constructing an  $\varepsilon $ -semimetric that measures exactly the desired distances in the point cloud. This results in a threat to fairness and objectiveness in applications of clustering algorithms: suppose that an adversary subjectively classifies people according to its whim or discriminatory preferences. Upon accusations of unethical behavior, the malicious data processor can plausibly deny these as follows: it designs a distance function (an  $\varepsilon $ -semimetric) that is (up to a fully controllable numeric “round-off-error”  $\varepsilon $ ) equivalent to a standard distance like the Euclidean. However, this crafted distance will exactly reproduce the (malicious) results and thus confirm them while pretending objectivity and transparency, since only standard and explainable artificial intelligence was used. This demonstration works without any data poisoning. We illustrate the method on randomly chosen points with stochastically independent random classifications assigned to them. Then, we apply standard implementations of k-Means and DBSCAN on the data points, which both exactly reproduce the desired (randomly chosen) classes. We also discuss non-adversarial applications of  $\varepsilon $ -semimetrics, and corroborate the construction with examples and implementation in Octave.

AB  - Explaining what does a data-driven control algorithm learns play a crucial role for safety critical control of autonomous platforms in transportation. This is more acute in reinforcement learning control algorithms, where the learned control policy depends on various factors that are hidden within the data. Explainable artificial intelligence methods have been used to explain the outcomes of machine learning methods by analysing input-output relations. However, data-driven control does not pose a simple input-output mapping and hence, the resulting explanations lack depth. To deal with this issue, this paper proposes a explainable data-driven control method that allows to understand what the data-driven method is learning from the data. The model is composed by a Q-learning algorithm enhanced by a dynamic mode decomposition with control (DMDc) algorithm for state-transition function estimation. Both the Q-learning and DMDc provides the elements that are learned from the data and allow the construction of counterfactual explanations. The proposed approach is robust and does not require hyperparameter tuning. Simulation experiments are conducted to observe the benefits and challenges of the method.

AB  - Explanations of deep learning fault diagnosis models have been crucial for risk management and subsequent maintenance actions. Furthermore, purely data-driven approaches for fault diagnosis in industrial processes, without integrating process knowledge or guidance, are limited in generalization ability. This article proposes a graph-based self-explanatory fault diagnosis model. The model employs a graph attention mechanism on a constructed graph data representation of the industrial process, facilitating to capture the causal relationships between process variables. Once the model is fully trained, variations in attention coefficients from normal operating condition are used to identify the root cause of the faulty scenario. This self-explanatory methodology elucidates the model's actual reasoning, obviating the need for additional separate explainable AI methods. Validations through benchmark processes demonstrate significant improvement in fault classification accuracy. Furthermore, variations in attention coefficients effectively identified precise origins of various fault types, including faults that had not been encountered during model training phase.

AB  - We propose the concept of “explainergy”, a new way of including explainability in the metaheuristic performance of algorithms solving problems in the energy domain. To this end, we open the discussion around eXplainable computational Intelligence (XCI), focusing on using metaheuristic optimization for complex energy-related problems. It is well known that computational intelligence applied to optimization cannot guarantee optimality theoretically and also faces issues related to premature convergence, tuning parameters, and variability of the results. These aspects slow the adoption of such methods by energy industry practitioners. Our proposal considers incorporating ideas already applied to the artificial intelligence paradigm, namely those related to eXplainable AI, to motivate current research in this field and provide solutions from metaheuristics with explainability character-istics. Through a case study solving a bidding problem in local electricity markets, we shed light on some ideas that might be advantageous to understanding the metaheuristic performance for energy experts unfamiliar with approximate algorithms. If an XCI framework is successfully developed, it can increase metaheuristic adoption, reliability, and broader success.

AB  - Cyber-Pyshical Systems (CPS) are increasingly vulnerable to worst-case cyberattacks, where adversaries exploit both cyber and physical components to maximize disruption while avoiding detection. Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) struggled against these adaptive threats due to their resilience on static rules and black-box models. This paper proposes an Explainable Artificial Intelligence-Based Intrusion Detection System (XAI-IDS) tailored for CPS security. By leveraging SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), our approach enhances threat visibility, enabling security practitioners to understand, trust, and refine attack mitigation strategies. The system dynamically detects cyber-physical anomalies, prioritizing high-risk attack paths, that reduce system resilience by 19% in worst-case scenarios. Experimental results show that Random Forest achieves 98.2% accuracy, Decision Tree 95.7%, and Logistic Regression 91.4%, with SHAP analysis identifying network traffic rate, sensor anomalies, and unauthorized access attempts as the most critical threat indicators. By reducing detection latency and improving interpretability, the proposed XAI-IDS ensures proactive real-time security industrial control systems against sophisticated adversarial threats.

AB  - Automated welding defect detection has emerged as a pivotal aspect of quality assurance in high-stakes industries such as aerospace, oil and gas, and construction. This paper presents a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art Deep Learning (DL) models tailored for welding defect detection, segmentation, and classification, emphasizing technical advancements and persistent challenges. A critical analysis of single-stage and two-stage architectures is conducted to evaluate their ability to address issues like small defect sizes, low image contrast, and diverse defect geometries. The study also highlights the integration of advanced preprocessing techniques, such as noise reduction and contrast enhancement, within DL workflows to improve feature extraction and detection accuracy. Persistent challenges, such as the scarcity of large, labeled datasets, lack of real-time applicability, and limited model interpretability, are explored in depth. To address these gaps, the survey proposes future directions, including the use of self-supervised learning, domain adaptation, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and explainable AI techniques to enhance the robustness, scalability, and transparency of welding defect detection systems. By synthesizing insights from more than a decade of research, this paper provides a detailed roadmap for advancing automated welding inspection technologies, enabling reliable deployment in real-world industrial environments.

AB  - The best-performing machine learning (ML) models suffer from a lack of interpretability. This study conducted an empirical evaluation of two interpretability techniques, global surrogate and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME). Experiments on two black boxes, a multilayer perceptron, and support vector machines were carried out on two breast cancer tabular datasets. The results show that local interpretability can work along the global one to provide insights into the model. Quantitative evaluations show that the global surrogate slightly outperforms LIME. Interpretability techniques have the potential to fix the interpretability trade-off for opaque models.

AB  - Deep Learning (DL) based artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming pervasive in almost all the day to day applications. These DL algorithms require large amounts of data, which can be easily collected nowadays by deploying sensors in the environment of the system under observation. These DL algorithms however, suffer from drawbacks such as being criticised as ‘black-boxes’, being biased to generating predictions based on past data and ignoring the human expertise. Hence, an architecture of Enhanced eXplainable Digital Twins (EXDTs) was proposed. EXDTs remove ‘black-boxness’ of DL algorithms by using the XAI approaches. Further, the digital twins (DTs) underlying the EXDTs are constructed through the sensor data and depict the real-time simulatability. Also, to improve the explainability and use the human expertise/ experience, EXDTs use the domain experts’ qualitative data. EXDTs are a class of Hybrid AI systems, that use the numeric data for underlying DL algorithms and subjective knowledge of the domain expert. This multimodal data in EXDTs opens up new attacks fronts for data manipulation and change the EXDTs’ outputs. In this manuscript, we discuss about the data protection in EXDTs, by simulating various types of attacks and suggesting possible ways the system can counter them. We feel our proposed framework is useful for the involved stakeholders in various domains like precision agriculture, healthcare, manufacturing, etc.

AB  - Traditional methods of pressure measurement of buildings are costly and time consuming. As an alternative to the traditional methods, this study developed a fast and computationally economical machine learning-based model to predict surface-averaged external pressure coefficients of a building with an unconventional configuration using three tree-based regressors: Adaboost, Extra Tree, and Random Forest. The accuracy and performance of the tree-based regressors were compared with a fourth-order polynomial function and a high-order non-linear regression proposed by an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The comparison revealed random forest and extra tree models were simpler and more accurate than the polynomial functions and the ANN model. Alternatively, a machine learning interpretability method-Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) – was used to quantify the contribution of each parameter to the models' outcomes. LIME identified the most influential parameter, the variation in the influence of parameters with their values, and interactions of parameters. Moreover, LIME confirmed the tree-based regressors closely follow the flow physics in predicting external wind pressures rather than solely relied on training data.

AB  - It is crucial to distinguish the network entities (NEs) behind NAT devices for tasks such as information gathering, asset management, and legal interception. The current mainstream approach has the problem of erroneously clustering traffic from a sparsely communicating NE as traffic from multiple NE. This leads to current algorithms not being able to be applied effectively in real environment. To address this issue, we propose a Linux NEs traffic clustering method based on TCP/IP features in this paper. We integrate multiple hidden level features such as operating system and timestamp and freely cluster the data set based on the density of spatial distribution. We use the datasets from the real campus network and public dataset to evaluate the performance of our method, and the results show that our method overcomes the problem erroneously clustering traffic from a sparsely communicating NE as traffic from multiple NEs. For the current mainstream Linux types, the purity of each version exceeds 0.91, RI exceeds 0.98, ARI exceeds 0.88, and FMI exceeds 0.89. Our method can accurately calculate the number of hosts behind NAT and cluster traffic accordingly.

AB  - Farmers have faced several difficulties as a result of the traditional techniques to identify leaf diseases, which have led to significant losses. Thankfully, technological developments have allowed us to effectively create leaf disease monitoring devices that help with early disease diagnosis. This paper investigates the realm of crop pest as they cause significant economic, social and environmental losses globally, making precise identification crucial for pest control in agriculture. Effective pest and disease management requires accurate and timely detection and classification of these pests and diseases. Deep learning techniques, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and YOLOv8 algorithms, have emerged as highly accurate and efficient tools for image-based pest and disease detection. Using CNN and YOLOv8 algorithms, this project aims to create a robust and efficient crop pest detection and classification system. To accomplish this goal, a large dataset of labelled images of various crop pests and diseases will be collected and preprocessed. Following that, using the prepared dataset, a CNN architecture will be designed and trained with the goal of extracting and analyzing key features from pest and disease images. Furthermore, the YOLOv8 object detection algorithm will be used to detect and classify pests and diseases in images. The trained CNN and YOLOv8 models will be integrated into an easy-to-use interface that will allow farmers and agricultural professionals to detect and identify crop pests and diseases in their fields. The proposed system’s performance will be measured using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP). The successful development of this crop pest detection and classification system will provide farmers with a valuable tool for timely and accurate pest and disease identification, ultimately contributing to improved crop health, yields, and agricultural productivity.

AB  - Employee turnover remains a important assignment for organizations, impacting productivity, morale, and operational continuity. Traditional strategies for predicting turnover regularly depend on demographic and task-related variables, yet fail to seize nuanced insights from unstructured statistics sources together with worker sentiment and engagement. This takes a look at proposes a singular technique utilizing autoencoders, a type of artificial neural network capable of mastering efficient representations of enter statistics, to uncover hidden styles inside various datasets associated with worker turnover. By leveraging anonymized textual statistics from employee surveys, overall performance reviews, and social media sentiments, the autoencoder model extracts latent features that reflect underlying elements contributing to turnover. The encoded representations are then utilized as inputs to predictive models, enhancing the accuracy and interpretability of turnover predictions. Through a comprehensive empirical analysis, the use of actual-global organizational information, we show the effectiveness of our technique in outperforming traditional methods, reaching better prediction accuracy and supplying actionable insights for HR practitioners. Furthermore, interpretability strategies inclusive of feature importance evaluation and visualization of latent spaces permit stakeholders to understand the driving forces behind turnover, facilitating proactive interventions and strategic choice-making. This research contributes to the sphere through bridging the space among superior machine gaining knowledge of strategies and human useful resource management, offering a robust framework for groups to preemptively cope with turnover challenges and foster a extra stable and engaged staff.

AB  - In precision livestock farming, accurate cattle identification is essential for enhancing animal welfare, health monitoring, and productivity, while also supporting traceability and minimizing false insurance claims. This paper presents a novel approach for cattle identification using muzzle prints, with a focus on both efficiency and explainability. Taxicab metric, employed for efficient annotation of muzzle patterns significantly reduces the labeling time for training of YOLOv8 model. YOLOv8 is utilized for detecting muzzle prints in images, followed by SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) for feature extraction and matching. The incorporation of Explainable AI (XAI) methods, particularly Grad-CAM, further enhances the transparency and interpretability of the SIFT model.

AB  - This is paper proposes a knowledge construction system. The key objective of the system is to extract knowledge from structured data which is generally available in the form of electronic medical records (EMR). In this regard, the main focus of the research is to design and develop a domain-independent system that is capable of assisting the domain expert(s) in gaining non-trivial insights from the underlying EMR data. It is important to note that most of the research in the domain of cost-sensitive feature selection relies on black-box models which only provide a prediction of a final class label. Whereas, the goal of this research is to acquire insights for domain experts such as chronic kidney disease classification. This goal is achieved by designing and developing a knowledge construction system that is based on a two-stage methodology. Stage one deals with identifying salient cost-sensitive features in the EMR data, whereas, stage-two deals with consolidating knowledge (i.e. in the form of production rules) from a set of interpretable machine learning models. Finally, in order to demonstrate the efficacy of the system a chronic kidney disease case study is adopted.

AB  - Summary <p>The healthcare sector is one of the biggest digital data providers, accounting for one third of global digital data volumes. This chapter aims to identify relevant artificial intelligence (AI) use cases that really move the needle for health insurers and give an overview on key strategic imperatives to derive an AI strategy that can best utilize their untapped data treasures. A wealth of use cases for AI has emerged that are gaining increasing traction both outside and inside health insurance. In general, use cases can be classified into three different levels: standard AI solutions, tailor&#x2010;made AI solutions, and explainable AI solutions. There is no right or wrong approach; however, health insurers need to start treating AI as a strategic asset that can help them in achieving their overall strategic goals. The chapter provides a four&#x2010;step approach that can help decision&#x2010;makers find the right starting point, and to plot a way forward.</p>

Here, how to build a trustworthy-AI framework based on the power system is the focus. Due to the multidimensional and heterogeneous information of power grid data, the heterogeneous graph attention network (HGAT) model of power grid dispatching is established, and the corresponding explainer (HGAT-Explainer) for the model of power equipment faults is proposed to provide more favorable support for the trustworthy-AI systems.

AB  - Liver transplantation is a critical, life-saving procedure for individuals with advanced liver disease or acute liver failure, but the outcomes can vary greatly. Accurate prediction of these outcomes is essential for optimizing organ allocation and enhancing patient management. Traditional methods, which rely on clinical scoring systems, often fall short due to subjective evaluations and their limited ability to process large-scale data. This study introduces an AI-driven approach to predict liver transplant outcomes using machine learning algorithms. The model was developed and validated with a comprehensive dataset of liver transplant cases, including donor and recipient characteristics, laboratory results, and clinical parameters. Advanced AI techniques, such as Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) and survival analysis through the Kaplan-Meier estimator, were employed to identify complex patterns and interactions within the data. The AI model significantly outperformed traditional scoring systems, achieving an AUCROC of 93.11% for 1-year post-transplant survival, thus enabling effective identification of high-risk patients and providing personalized risk assessments. By incorporating diverse pre-transplant clinical data, the model captures the multifactorial nature of liver transplant outcomes, offering insights that go beyond traditional methods. Its potential to transform clinical workflows includes facilitating data-driven decisions in organ allocation and supporting personalized care strategies. This innovation highlights the potential of AI to refine liver transplant predictions, optimize patient outcomes, and advance organ allocation policies.

AB  - The goal of portfolio optimization in investment management deals with combining return objectives with risk control under conditionally changing and volatile market environments. Standard optimization procedures fail to capture market dynamics alongside financial market non-stationarity patterns since they result in inferior decisions. Building a system of continuous learning models that makes data-driven decisions in real time represents the main challenge in this task. The proposed solution meets these challenges through an RL algorithm integration with LSTM networks for stock price forecasting accuracy and Deep Q-Networks (DQN) implemented for instant Buy, Hold or Sell decisions. The model achieves portfolio return maximization by minimizing risk through adaptive performance that tracks market changes and improves its decisions continuously. The hybrid model functions better than traditional systems in handling market fluctuations because it simultaneously advances portfolio returns while managing real-time risk proportions effectively. Based on its R2 value of 0.78 the LSTM model demonstrates adequate performance in detecting stock price connections but the DQN model relies on cumulative reward to optimize trading decisions.

AB  - This paper addresses the interpretability and transparency behind the random forest model predictions. Random forest is an ensemble of bootstrapped independent decision trees that are trained on subsets of input data to make predictions. Although random forest is a robust model that can overcome bias, its inherent complexity, and poor interpretability can make it challenging to apply in many application domains that require transparency and explainability in the model’s predictions. This lack of transparency in the decision-making process can prevent users from analyzing what makes the model arrive at a specific prediction. The paper presents a visual analytic application to overcome transparency challenges by providing a clear structure of individual decision trees and hierarchical relationships between features. This allows users to analyze latent information and instils trust in the random forest model. Additionally, statistical analysis of feature ranking agreement and prediction popularity reduces mental burden of the user. The paper includes two case studies to evaluate model’s uncertainty, bias, and variances in predictions with explainability at local and global scales of decision paths. The visual analytics application provides a coordinated multiple-view system to instil trust in random forest models.

AB  - The Metaverse is an online universe that combines virtual reality and augmented reality, linked together via a network.It has generated novel experiences that are fully engaging and transpire in real time, facilitating interpersonal communication and dialogue. Virtual environments with 3D space and avatars can boost patient-facing platforms, operational utilisation, digital education, diagnostics, and treatment choices in medicine and ophthalmology. Globally, there is an increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, with an estimated 25 percent of individuals presently contending with multiple chronic health issues. The management of chronic diseases is currently being rethought in light of the development of technology known together as “Smart Healthcare.” A prime example is state-of-the-art wearable technology that incentivizes people to embrace healthier lifestyles through the monitoring of physiological indicators and metabolic processes. With better data organisation and analysis, chronic disease patients may benefit from improved health, privacy, and quality of life. Through the examination of physiological data acquired from wearable devices on a patient, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the capability to generate informed recommendations pertaining to the diagnosis and treatment of illness. These recommendations can be provided by AI. The adoption of blockchain technology (BC) has the potential to significantly advance healthcare in a variety of ways, including decentralised data sharing, user privacy, user empowerment, and dependability in data administration. The potential impact of Wearable Technologies (WT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Blockchain Technology (BC) on Chronic Disease Management (CDM) could be a transition in emphasis from the hospital to the patient. This article provides a patient-centered technical framework for controlling chronic diseases using artificial intelligence, blockchain, and wearable technologies. Our proposed architecture depends on Metaverse environment. In order to participate in the Metaverse, both patients and physicians need to sign up on the Blockchain network. After entering, customers will be accompanied by avatars throughout the experience. A comprehensive record of all information gathered during doctor-patient consultations, including text, videos, images, audio, and clinical data, will be compiled, uploaded to the blockchain, and stored in perpetuity. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) algorithms examine these particulars in order to diagnose and forecast the progression of diseases. We conclude with a discussion of the constraints of this novel paradigm and recommendations for future research.

AB  - This study addresses the critical global issue of food security, particularly under the influence of climate change on agricultural land suitability. The primary objective of our research is to predict the risks associated with land suitability degradation and changes in irrigation patterns, directly impacting food security. This research aligns with the United Nations’ sustainable development goals to reduce hunger and malnutrition. Central Eurasia, a region facing unique economic and social challenges, serves as the focal point of our investigation, providing a pertinent example for analyzing the effects of climate change on food security. In our approach, we employ interpretable machine learning techniques to analyze the impact of climate change on agricultural land suitability under different carbon emission scenarios. The developed model demonstrates strong performance, evidenced by an accuracy of 86% and a mean average precision of 72% in a multi-class land suitability classification task. Focusing on the most vulnerable regions in Eastern Europe and Northern Asia, our research provides crucial insights for policymakers. These insights are instrumental for strategic planning, including the allocation of critical resources like water and fertilizers, to prevent humanitarian crises. The results demonstrate that machine learning can be a powerful tool in predicting and managing the impacts of climate change on food security.

AB  - Autonomous predictive maintenance (PMx) is increasingly recognized as essential for optimizing reliability, minimizing downtime, and reducing operational costs. However, the concept of “autonomy” remains loosely defined, leading to inconsistent implementation across industries. At the same time, digital twins (DTs) hold promise for enabling advanced autonomy by offering real-time data integration, dynamic simulation, lifecycle monitoring, and advanced analytics. Yet, the absence of a structured roadmap for development prevents these capabilities from driving autonomous PMx solutions. This paper addresses both of these challenges with a dual contribution. First, it adapts a well-established Levels of Autonomy (LoA) framework-originally developed for autonomous vehicle standards-and maps it to defined informational requirements (IRs) and functional requirements (FRs) in PMx, offering a standardized method for systematically advancing autonomy. Second, we illustrate how to apply these guidelines to support DT-based PMx solutions across an asset or system's lifecycle, progressively fulfilling LoA-specific IRs and FRs at each stage. An illustrative example focused on a pedestrian steel truss bridge contextualizes how this progressive approach fosters more structured and uniform DT implementation and higher PMx autonomy.

AB  - As advertisers increasingly shift their budgets to-ward digital advertising, accurately forecasting advertising costs becomes essential for optimizing marketing campaign returns. This paper presents a comprehensive study that employs various time-series forecasting methods to predict daily average CPC in the online advertising market. We evaluate the performance of statistical models, machine learning techniques, and deep learning approaches, including the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT). Our findings reveal that incorporating multivariate models, enriched with covariates derived from competitors' CPC patterns through time-series clustering, significantly improves forecasting accuracy. We interpret the results by analyzing feature importance and temporal attention, demonstrating how the models leverage both the advertiser's data and insights from the competitive landscape. Additionally, our method proves robust during major market shifts, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, consistently outperforming models that rely solely on individual advertisers' data. This study introduces a scalable technique for selecting relevant covariates from a broad pool of advertisers, offering more accurate long-term forecasts and strategic insights into budget allocation and competitive dynamics in digital advertising.

AB  - The integration of carbon markets with the electricity sector represents a crucial development in aligning economic activities with environmental goals, particularly in China. Generation companies (GenCos) navigate these coupled markets through strategic bidding behaviors influenced by various carbon emission allowance (CEA) allocation methods. This study explores how different market conditions and regulatory policies shape GenCo bidding strategies, employing deep learning models like GAN to model these behaviors. To enhance interpretability, we utilize Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and introduce a Bayesian extension (BayLIME), which leverages empirical data and prior knowledge for a more robust analysis. The results demonstrate significant correlations between operational features and strategic dimensions, providing insights that could aid in optimizing market performance and ensuring compliance. The application of BayLIME particularly enhances the reliability and consistency of model explanations, offering a clearer understanding of market dynamics for stakeholders. The findings contribute to both strategic planning and policy-making efforts aimed at fostering a sustainable energy market.

AB  - Deep learning methods have shown significant performance in medical image analysis tasks. However, they generally act like ”black box” without explanations in both feature extraction and decision processes, leading to lack of clinical insights and high risk assessments. To aid deep learning in envisioning diseases with visual clues, we propose Representation Group-Disentangling Network (RGD-Net), which can completely disentangle feature space of input X-ray images into several independent feature groups, each corresponding to a specific disease. Taking several semantically related and labeled X-ray images as input, RGD-Net firstly extracts completely group-disentangled representations of diseases through Group-Disentangle Module, which applies group-swap and linking operations to construct latent space by enforcing semantic consistency of attributes. To prevent learning degenerate representations defined as shortcut problem, we further introduce adversarial constricts on mapping from features to diseases, thus avoiding model collapse with former free-form disentanglement. Experiments on chestxray-14 and ChestXpert datasets demonstrate that RGD-Net are effective in predicting diseases with remarkable advantages, which leverage potential factors contributing to different diseases, thus enhancing interpretability in working patterns of deep learning methods.

AB  - Effective risk management and compliance adherence are paramount for the success of financial institutions and organizations. However, they often face significant challenges due to fraudulent activities, with ATM fraud, among others, emerging as a prevalent issue in today’s banking landscape. We proposed a novel profiling-based one-class classification (OCC) method to solve this problem. Then training phase of our approach employs the K-Means clustering algorithm to cluster non-fraudulent transactions exhibiting similar characteristics and patterns. A rule is generated from each cluster, thereby in a rule set comprising K rules, each consisting of conditions based on the lower and upper bounds on all features. This rule set is employed to identify fraudulent transactions presented in the test phase because ours is an OCC method. One distinctive feature of our approach is its interpretability and explainability, which is crucial for understanding the model's predictions. Overall, our proposed approach demonstrates the best performance vis-à-vis that of various state-of-the-art OCC methods in terms of classification rate. Additionally, we provide sensitivity analysis by varying the number of conditions violated across the K rules.

AB  - Existing models have obtained satisfactory results on whether users have fallen or not. However, in our lives, due to the unpredictability of falls, the binary fall detection models cannot identify different patterns of falls and thus cannot take corresponding protective measures. Therefore, the recognition of more subtle falls has become an urgent challenge. Moreover, the complexity of fall detection models makes it difficult to explain the decision process. In this paper, we propose a new interpretable fine-grained fall detection network, called ProtoPLSTM. The model consists of three main modules: CNN-LSTM encoder backbone network, contextual enhancement module, and ProtoPNet-based network. The first module learns a multi-sensor feature representation through a carefully designed embedding network. The contextual enhancement module expands the receptive field to capture more discriminative features through contextual information and then mines the inter-class differences and intra-class associations of different kinds of falls. The last module globally explains why a fall is detected as some kind of fall from the prototype’s perspective. Our experiments on SisFall, a publicly available dataset with the largest number of fall classes, demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform state-of-the-art methods while having interpretability. The visualization and qualitative analysis explained the important factors and decision-making processes for the occurrence of different kinds of falls from a prototypical perspective.

AB  - In this study, the performance of an L-shaped front wall OWC (Oscillating Water Column) device is investigated in the presence of irregular incident waves. To efficiently explore the complex interactions between input features and the target variable, two supervised machine learning models: (i) a decision tree model and (ii) an XGBoost model are considered. The input parameters selected for this analysis are: OWC Front wall Draft, OWC Duct Length, Chamber Length, ripple Number, and ripple amplitude of the sinusoidal seabed. The output attribute is the maximum power extracted by the OWC device. The XG Boost model is used to identify critical input regions where power extraction peaks, while the decision tree model further aids in understanding the parameter influences on power extraction. A dataset of 3125 samples was generated for training, validation, and testing. By employing accumulated local effect plots with the XG Boost model, five specific regions in the input space were identified that maximize annual average power extraction. The results indicate that optimal power extraction is achieved for a specific value of each parameter, thereby validating the influence of each on OWC device performance.

AB  - Industry 5.0 is a new paradigm that seeks to improve production via the use of cutting-edge technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing. Distributed denial of service (DDoS) assaults, for example, may severely harm industrial processes and disrupt the whole supply chain, but this integration of technology also presents significant security issues. Therefore, it is crucial in the age of Industry 5.0 to create reliable DDoS attack detection systems. In this research, we offer a DDoS attack detection system for the Industry 5.0 environment that makes use of Digital Twins (DTs) and Machine Learning (ML). Our method takes use of the strengths of DTs to model the production flow virtually, which can then be used to track the system’s behaviour and spot any hiccups. For further analysis of the DTs’ output data in order to spot possible DDoS assaults, we use explicable ML algorithms like the decision tree classifier.

AB  - Monitoring Industrial tool wear is important in predictive maintenance as it helps in drilling process productivity and the quality of products. In this case, high-resolution images showing the state of the machining tools were taken under various conditions, making it possible to predict tool wear using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The trained CNN model segments predicts worn out regions and subsequently provides the possibility of unobtrusive site monitoring. This method of requesting a socalled buffer to avoid critical failure of a tool presages traditional techniques greatly. The experiments showed that the set of algorithms developed under the task have increased accuracy upto 90% in defect detection, decreased the system idle time, and improved the schedule of the tool's operational lifetime. These results confirm the assumption about the applicability of deep learning for increasing effectiveness and reliability of manufacturing processes.

AB  - Software maintenance and support efforts consume a significant amount of the software project budget to operate the software system in its expected quality. Manually estimating the total hours required for this phase can be very time-consuming, and often differs from the actual cost that is incurred. The automation of these estimation processes can be implemented with the aid of machine learning algorithms. The maintenance and support effort prediction models need to be explainable so that project managers can understand which features contributed to the model outcome. This study contributes to the development of the maintenance and support effort prediction model using various tree-based re-gression machine-learning techniques from cross-company project information. The developed models were explained using the state-of-the-art model agnostic technique SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to understand the significance of features from the developed model. This study concluded that staff size, application size, and number of defects are major contributors to the maintenance and support effort prediction models.

We employed six machine learning algorithms: decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), adaptive boosting (Ad-aBoost), gradient boosting (GB), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), and extreme gradient boosting machine (XGBoost). By employing this rigorous approach to hyperparameter tuning based on Bayesian optimization, the XGBoost method was found as the best method for both mid-season and end-season cotton yield prediction. Furthermore, we investigated the global importance of temporal and static features using the Shapley Additive Global importancE (SAGE) method to understand the driving factors of cotton yield prediction. As a result of global feature importance analysis, precipitation (P), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and leaf area index (LAI) were found as the most important temporal features, while silt and pH were found as the most important soil properties.

AB  - Cotton, a vital crop in the global textile industry, faces challenges from climate and ecosystem changes. Accurate cotton yield prediction is crucial for the economy and environmental sustainability, and it requires a deep understanding of the complex relationship between its parameters and yield. To achieve this, a comprehensive approach integrating climatic factors, soil parameters, and biophysical parameters observed through high-resolution remote sensing satellites was employed. This study utilized a multisource dataset to develop a predictive model for cotton yield over Turkiye, allowing accurate yield estimation and understanding the impact of the Earth Observation (EO)-based yield predictors on the model. Specifically, we utilized the Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) algorithm to model and predict cotton yield while offering insights into selecting EO predictors. Additionally, we conducted a performance evaluation of our proposed approach in comparison to popular boosting-based algorithms like eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), and Light gradient boosting (Light-GBM).

AB  - The efficacy of any machine learning model is largely contingent on the quality of the features used for training. Hence, the extraction of robust and discriminative features from raw data is a critical step. This task, however, presents significant challenges. Although modern deep learning models are very advanced, they are often criticized for their black-box nature. The predictions made by these models are not readily interpretable in terms of the features that influenced them. In our research, we propose a novel framework that innovatively combines the prowess of convolutional layers for feature extraction with robustness of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model the relationships of neuron activations for better interpretability. The proposed architecture initially generates features to produce class-based neuron activations, these activations are then incorporated into graph structure. The GNN incorporates the relationship between neuron activations to produce final classifications. The proposed model provides explainability as in the predictions can be traced back to the specific neurons that contributed to them. The proposed model not only matches the accuracy of state-of-the-art models but also provides explainability through target class-specific feature importance.

AB  - This study investigated the influence of built environment features on crosswalk safety in dense urban settings, with a focus on visual streetscape characteristics extracted from street-view imagery using both semantic and instance segmentation. It used data from 36,750 crosswalks in Seoul, South Korea, to rigorously evaluate multiple machine learning algorithms for predicting pedestrian crash risk. Among the models assessed, the Random forest (RF) demonstrated the highest precision, aligning with the objective of enhancing pedestrian safety through accurate risk identification. The RF model enhanced by SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) achieved strong predictive performance (precision: 0.91), and SHAP analysis identified visual features, particularly sky openness ratio, building coverage, and sidewalk ratio, as influential factors affecting crash risk. A lower sky openness ratio combined with a higher building ratio was associated with increased crash likelihood, whereas greater sidewalk coverage and the presence of traffic control measures, including traffic lights and crosswalk time indicators, mitigated risk. Interaction effects further highlighted the complexity of urban safety, showing that combinations of streetscape and infrastructural elements can amplify or reduce hazards. These results highlight the importance of combining visual and structural data for thorough risk assessment and further the use of interpretable machine learning in urban safety research. The findings imply that to address particular combinations of built environment elements that increase the risk of crosswalk crashes, policy and planning initiatives should concentrate on context-sensitive interventions, particularly by placing bus stops strategically, maintaining tree canopies for visibility, clearing visual clutter, and improving pedestrian infrastructure.

AB  - In this case study, we introduce two ML techniques, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and an optimized Random Forest (RF), to address challenges related to capacity and cost, by addressing problems of unscheduled downtime and Process Time (PT) variation in the case of a complex chamber processing tool. We show that by using these ML techniques, traditional methods of Predictive Maintenance (PdM) and PT analysis can be enhanced with new insights and lead to significant productivity improvements. We demonstrate that, with these methods, by detecting states and attributes of the tool, trends in the tool’s behavior can be more effectively identified to reduce its unscheduled downtime and improve its run-rate, thereby resulting in significant capacity and cost improvements. This is achieved by reducing the variability of availability; extending the Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF); and removing variability in PT between lots and chambers.

AB  - Accurate travel time prediction is essential for road users, logistic operators, and public transportation planners for efficient route planning, fleet management, and timely arrival estimation of goods and passengers. This paper aims to advance travel time prediction by quantifying uncertainties arising from traffic demand, weather conditions, and incidents. The study uses a Bayesian Neural Network with Monte Carlo dropout to enhance the prediction accuracy, robustness, and reliability for applications in dynamic and complex traffic conditions. The results show that the dropout probability rate and activation functions are the two most important factors affecting the model’s performance in uncertainty quantification is particularly important for our downstream decision-making process. Additionally, uncertainty quantification leads to more explainable and actionable decisions. This approach can improve operational planning and ensure better service delivery and user satisfaction, highlighting its critical role in the advancement of intelligent transportation systems.

AB  - Detecting bid-rigging in public procurement is crucial for identifying collusive behaviors in bidding activities. However, the well-accepted cartel-like detection methods based on machine learning are not efficient to identify complex relationships between features associated with collusive behaviors. Further, the detection methods based on deep learning are not competent at interpretability and transparency, which are critical to support decision-making to clarify why the transaction entities are announced to be bid-rigging. Addressing this gap, we propose a novel detection approach that enhances interpretability by integrating deep learning with case-based reasoning. Our deep learning model learns complex patterns and nonlinear relationships in the data, while case-based reasoning provides interpretability through analogies to previous cases. Evaluation on a Japanese public procurement dataset demonstrates that our method not only achieves superior performance but also ensures interpretability. This study is a new and practical attempt to apply deep learning to detect bid-rigging activities with explainable decisions.

AB  - Memristive LSTM networks have been proven as a powerful Neuromorphic Computing Architecture (NCA) for various time series forecasting tasks and are recognized as the next generation of AI. However, a lack of model explainability makes it hard to properly interpret forecasting results for existing memristive LSTM networks, which makes this NCA unreliable, unaccountable and untrustworthy. In this paper, an interpretable memristive (IM) LSTM network design is proposed for time series forecasting, where the mixture attention technique is embedded into IM-LSTM cells for characterizing the variable-wise feature and the temporal importance. The updating rules and training approach are also presented for this interpretable memristive LSTM network. We evaluate this approach on a probabilistic residential load forecasting task incorporating PV. By improving model interpretability, the most influential predictive factors can be verified by Built Environment domain experts, demonstrating the effectiveness of our design.

AB  - Since deep learning may increase prediction accuracy and improves decision-making, its application in credit risk assessment has gained a lot of attention recently. However, using deep learning models in critical domains such as finance calls for a more thorough examination of their reliability, comprehensibility, and ethics. In order to overcome the problem of limited model transparency and interpretability, this study investigates the application of deep learning and Explainable AI (XAI) methodologies for credit risk assessment. With accuracies ranging from 0.249 to 0.819, implementation and assessment of classic machine learning models was performed first, such as Logistic Regression, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Extra Trees Classifier, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Dummy Classifier, and Decision Tree Classifier. After that, deep learning models with accuracies ranging from 0.667 to 0.777, including LSTMs, MLPs, and Autoencoders, were investigated. In order to improve performance and resilience even more, a combination of LSTMs, MLPs, and Autoencoders was used to create a hybrid model that outperformed both conventional and lone deep learning models, achieving an accuracy of 0.78. XAI approaches, notably LIME and SHAP, were employed to promote trust and offer insights into the ensemble model's decision-making process. The usefulness of the suggested explainable ensemble approach for credit risk assessment is demonstrated by evaluation on the “Default of Credit Card Clients” dataset, which contains 30,000 data points and 23 features.

AB  - Purpose - Perception has been identified as the main cause underlying most autonomous vehicle related accidents. As the key technology in perception, deep learning (DL) based computer vision models are generally considered to be black boxes due to poor interpretability. These have exacerbated user distrust and further forestalled their widespread deployment in practical usage. This paper aims to develop explainable DL models for autonomous driving by jointly predicting potential driving actions with corresponding explanations. The explainable DL models can not only boost user trust in autonomy but also serve as a diagnostic approach to identify any model deficiencies or limitations during the system development phase. Design/methodology/approach - This paper proposes an explainable end-to-end autonomous driving system based on "Transformer," a state-of-the-art self-attention (SA) based model. The model maps visual features from images collected by onboard cameras to guide potential driving actions with corresponding explanations, and aims to achieve soft attention over the image's global features. Findings - The results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model as it exhibits superior performance (in terms of correct prediction of actions and explanations) compared to the benchmark model by a significant margin with much lower computational cost on a public data set (BDD-OIA). From the ablation studies, the proposed SA module also outperforms other attention mechanisms in feature fusion and can generate meaningful representations for downstream prediction. Originality/value - In the contexts of situational awareness and driver assistance, the proposed model can perform as a driving alarm system for both human-driven vehicles and autonomous vehicles because it is capable of quickly understanding/characterizing the environment and identifying any infeasible driving actions. In addition, the extra explanation head of the proposed model provides an extra channel for sanity checks to guarantee that the model learns the ideal causal relationships. This provision is critical in the development of autonomous systems.

AB  - Sorghum is a vital crop known for its resilience in harsh environmental conditions, playing a key role in food security and bioenergy production across the globe. Accurate sorghum weed classification is crucial for efficient agricultural management, yet traditional methods are labour-intensive and resource-heavy. This research presents the first work on the sorghum weed classification dataset, introducing a novel deep-learning model using a customised DenseNet-169, enhanced with two innovative feature extraction blocks: Dimensional Convolutional Feature Fusion (DCFF) and Deformable Multi-Kernel Channel Fusion (DMKCF). These blocks improve multi-scale feature extraction and adaptively capture complex patterns from the weed images. The model also integrates Triplet Attention (TA) to refine feature representations and employs Grad-CAM and LIME for visual interpretability, offering insights into the classification process. The proposed network, when tested on the SorghumWeedDataset_Classification, achieved a testing accuracy of 99.07%, surpassing several state-of-the-art CNN models. The proposed model provides a robust solution for sorghum weed classification, advancing agricultural monitoring and management practices. Additionally, the model achieved 100% accuracy for the broad leaf weed class, further underscoring its effectiveness in identifying and classifying sorghum weeds with absolute precision.

AB  - The interpretation of deep learning network is an important part in understanding the convolutional neural networks (CNNs). As an exploratory research, this article explored the interpretation method in 3-D point cloud deep learning networks, for the purpose of evaluating the performance of convolution functions in 3-D point cloud CNNs. Specifically, a 3-D point cloud classification network with two branches is used as the interpretation network in two aspects; 1) information entropy is introduced to diagnose the internal representation in the middle layer of CNN; and 2) the external consistency of convolution function is measured by per-point classification accuracy with class activation mapping technique. Four typical convolution functions are tested by the interpretation network on ModelNet40 dataset and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed evaluation method is reliable. Feature transformation ability and feature recognition ability of convolution functions are extracted by visualization evaluation and proposed measurable metrics evaluation.
