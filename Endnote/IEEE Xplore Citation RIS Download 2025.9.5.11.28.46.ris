AB  - The increasing complexity and dynamism of modern digital infrastructures have significantly elevated the difficulty of anticipating and mitigating cyber threats. Traditional risk assessment methods, often based on static rules and signature matching, fail to provide sufficient predictive capabilities in scenarios characterized by high-volume, heterogeneous data and evolving attack patterns. Furthermore, conventional machine learning models lack architectural flexibility and contextual awareness to detect stealthy or multi-stage attacks across distributed environments. This paper proposes a hybrid model for predictive cyber risk assessment that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for relational pattern modeling, a Transformer-based language model (CyberBERT) for semantic representation of logs and traffic data, and a Federated Learning framework to preserve data privacy during training. The model was trained and evaluated using public datasets (CIC-IDS2017, UNSW-NB15, MITRE ATT&CK, TON_IoT) and synthetically generated traffic from honeypots and real anonymized networks. The system achieved an average F1-score of 0.947, significantly outperforming traditional classifiers such as SVM (0.836), Random Forest (0.873), and standard deep neural networks (0.901). Including adversarial training improved attack detection by 21.3 % under evasion scenarios. Furthermore, the model supports interpretability through SHAP and LIME, reaching an 83.5 % concordance in explanation consistency. The architecture demonstrates scalability and low-latency inference on edge and cloud platforms, making it suitable for real-time deployment in heterogeneous environments. These results highlight the model’s capability to deliver accurate, resilient, and privacy-preserving predictions of cyber risks across dynamic and distributed infrastructures.

AB  - Hand gesture recognition using multichannel surface electromyography (sEMG) is challenging due to unstable predictions and inefficient time-varying feature enhancement. To overcome the lack of signal-based time-varying feature problems, we propose a lightweight squeeze-excitation deep learning-based multi-stream spatial-temporal dynamics time-varying feature extraction approach to build an effective sEMG-based hand gesture recognition system. Each branch of the proposed model was designed to extract hierarchical features, capturing both global and detailed spatial-temporal relationships to ensure feature effectiveness. The first branch, utilizing a Bidirectional-TCN (Bi-TCN), focuses on capturing long-term temporal dependencies by modelling past and future temporal contexts, providing a holistic view of gesture dynamics. The second branch, incorporating a 1D Convolutional layer, separable CNN, and Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) block, efficiently extracts spatial-temporal features while emphasizing critical feature channels, enhancing feature relevance. The third branch, combining a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), captures bidirectional temporal relationships and time-varying patterns. Outputs from all branches are fused using concatenation to capture subtle variations in the data and then refined with a channel attention module, selectively focusing on the most informative features while improving computational efficiency. The proposed model was tested on the Ninapro DB2, DB4, and DB5 datasets, achieving accuracy rates of 95.31%, 92.40%, and 93.34%, respectively. Additionally, we visualize the attention maps across various classes. These results demonstrate the system’s capability to handle complex sEMG dynamics, offering advancements in prosthetic limb control and human-machine interface technologies with significant implications for assistive technologies.

AB  - Interpretable machine learning models have recently received a considerable attention for their capability to provide understandable explanations of predictions evoked from complex systems. In this paper a novel automatic interpretable classification scheme is introduced based on a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM). The proposed approach aims to address the problem of image classification using high-level features, extracted from a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The proposed FCM constitutes a fuzzy-graph structure for representing causal reasoning concerning semantic concepts of the real world, as these are depicted within different images. An advantage over current classifiers is that the proposed FCM embeds a mechanism for automatic determination of its structure from the datasets used in each experiment. More importantly, it provides interpretable classification results, whereas it is simple to implement. Experimental results using publicly available datasets show that the proposed approach efficiently extends the application of the traditional FCMs into image classification problem.

AB  - Bean rust and angular leaf spot pose significant challenges to bean cultivation, impacting yields. Prompt disease identification maximizes productivity, but traditional methods need specialized expertise. This research presents an explainable deep learning model that combines the Pyramid Vision Transformer (PVT) and Group Context Aware Depthwise Shuffle Network (GCADSN). The PVT effectively models long-range dependencies, identifying disease patterns across larger leaf areas, while the GCADSN focuses on capturing nuanced, context-specific features. This combined approach leads to a richer representation of the input image, resulting in improved disease classification. Model explainability is provided through GradCAM visualizations, highlighting the image regions crucial for the model’s predictions and enabling transparent, class-specific insights. The model’s performance was rigorously tested using the IBean dataset, a collection of images depicting various bean leaf diseases, including common rust, angular leaf spot, and healthy leaves. Our proposed network achieved a high accuracy of 97.66%, outperforming many current state-of-the-art deep learning models. Furthermore, it demonstrated strong performance across other key metrics, with an F1 score of 97.67%, precision of 97.83%, and recall of 97.67%. Importantly, the model’s computational efficiency makes it well-suited for practical application in real-world agricultural scenarios.

AB  - Concrete architectural structures are widely used in urban construction, making the health diagnosis and maintenance of these structures increasingly essential and urgent. Crack identification is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and safety of buildings. Traditional methods rely on manual inspection, which is plagued by low accuracy, inefficiency, and safety hazards. This paper proposes a technique combining an attention-based SqueezeNet network with Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) for automatically recognizing and visually explaining building cracks. By integrating the Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) attention mechanism with the lightweight SqueezeNet network, this method can adaptively adjust the importance of feature channels by learning global information, effectively improving the network’s accuracy and efficiency. The experimental results show that the Att-SqueezeNet model achieved a high precision of 0.995, a training time of only 133 seconds, and a model size of 4.9M, significantly outperforming models such as SqueezeNet, RF, CNN, VGG-19, and B-CNN. This demonstrates its robustness, rapid identification and suitability for practical applications and building crack identification. Moreover, the utilization of Grad-CAM for visualization not only offers an intuitive explanation of the model’s decision-making process but also provides a more comprehensible understanding of crack detection results. This is crucial for advancing building maintenance automation, reducing reliance on manual labor, and increasing the precision and reliability of detection tasks.

AB  - Epigenetics encompasses dynamic and reversible modifications that regulate gene activity without altering the underlying DNA sequence. Epigenetic processes, including non-coding RNA interactions, and DNA methylation regulate patterns of gene expression by responding to cellular signaling, environmental stimuli, and developmental cues. The balance of histone acetylation is maintained by histone deacetylase (HDAC) and histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activities. Aberrant HDAC upregulation, often seen in cancer cells, disrupts this balance. HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) are thus used in cancer treatment. However, most synthetic HDACis are not specific to HDAC classes or individual members, highlighting the need for highly selective HDAC inhibitors. Machine learning (ML)-driven methods are now recognized as rapid and cost-efficient tools in drug discovery and development, capable of identifying inhibitors solely from SMILES notation, without requiring the 3D ligand structure. Here, we present a novel and interpretable deep learning-based framework, DeepHDAC3i, for accurate in silico identification of HDAC3i using only the SMILES notation. Firstly, we employed five molecular encoding methods, namely CDKExt, KR, KRC, Pubchem, and RDKIT, to extract the biological and structural information in HDAC3i. These molecular representations were then fused to generate multi-view features. Secondly, elastic net was employed to determine the optimal feature subset and enhance prediction performance. Thirdly, a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) coupled with the optimal feature set was chosen for the construction of the final model. Finally, our framework leveraged the Shapley Additive exPlanation algorithm to disclose the most important features for identifying HDAC3i. On the independent test dataset, DeepHDAC3i achieved an accuracy of 0.965, MCC of 0.930, and AUC of 0.985, which were significantly higher than several conventional machine learning and deep learning models. In addition, upon comparison with the existing methods, DeepHDAC3i secured the best performance with improvements of approximately 4.80, 4.70, 6.50, and 9.50% in accuracy, F1, AUC, and MCC, respectively. Taken together, DeepHDAC3i is superior to other compared models and can be a useful tool for precisely identifying HDAC3i.

AB  - This article introduces a new iterative approach to explainable feature learning. During each iteration, new features are generated, first by applying arithmetic operations on the input set of features. These are then evaluated in terms of probability distribution agreements between values of samples belonging to different classes. Finally, a graph-based approach for feature selection is proposed, which allows for selecting high-quality and uncorrelated features to be used in feature generation during the next iteration. As shown by the results, the proposed method improved the accuracy of all tested classifiers, where the best accuracies were achieved using random forest. In addition, the method turned out to be insensitive to both of the input parameters, while superior performances in comparison to the state of the art were demonstrated on nine out of 15 test sets and achieving comparable results in the others. Finally, we demonstrate the explainability of the learned feature representation for knowledge discovery.

AB  - This study presents a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to predict the effective CBR (ECBR) of soil subgrade stabilized with recycled plastic waste under repeated loading (RL) conditions. Univariate and bivariate GAM were explored to evaluate the influence of parameter interactions on ECBR predictions. The Bivariate GAM model demonstrated superior performance, achieving a cross-validation mean squared error of  $9.2203\times 10^{-5}$ , mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.007, root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.009, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.077 and percentage bias (PBIAS) of 0.00026% indicating minimal deviation and high accuracy. Localized interpretability analysis yielded ECBR predictions closely aligned with the actual values, highlighting the model’s robustness. Further interpretability analysis through mutual information and partial dependence plots identified resilient modulus ( $\text{M}_{\mathrm {r}}$ ), optimum moisture content (OMC), maximum dry density (MDD) and content of plastic waste (CP) as key predictors influencing ECBR. Among these Mr demonstrated the highest mutual information score (1.00), emphasizing its critical role and direct association with RL conditions. The Predicted ECBR values, with a 1.130% average deviation from literature-derived values, confirm the bivariate GAM’s exceptional accuracy and reliability in handling the diverse, unseen datasets. These findings underscore the model’s potential as a trustworthy, interpretable and efficient alternative to traditional methods for road pavement applications.

AB  - For investors seeking solutions to optimize their portfolio of assets to generate profits and minimize losses, choosing a sophisticated model to evaluate the risk of corporate financial distress will be crucial to support their asset management and investment decisions. Both the machine learning and the newly developed deep learning techniques have been employed to construct bankruptcy prediction models for decades. However, applying the deep learning models might increase the predictive accuracy in exchange for losing model interpretability, because the structure and parameters of the model are not easy to provide accountability for investors. In this study, a hybrid approach integrating the decision tree with the deep neural network was proposed to provide a compromise solution for investors. The decision tree was adopted as the primary model to provide explainable ability, while the deep neural network was chosen to improve predictive accuracy. The decision fusion of two models was designed with the compensatory and non-compensatory approaches. The hybrid model was implemented by concatenating the deep neural network to the selected branches of decision tree that perform poor predictive accuracy during model training. The empirical results showed that the predictive accuracy of the deep neural network and the decision tree were 80% and 87% respectively, and the overall accuracy was improved to 91% by the hybrid model.

AB  - Efficient research and development (R&D) workflows are critical in industries where early-stage results influence downstream outcomes. This study develops a predictive model to enhance R&D efficiency for a leading integrated device manufacturer specializing in printed circuit board design. To address challenges of limited data, noise and collinearity, we apply sparse principal component analysis (SPCA) to simplify simulation data, followed by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression to predict later-stage physical testing performance. Our SPCA-LASSO model reduces prediction errors by 22%–41% compared to direct LASSO regression while offering interpretable insights for engineers. In contrast, sparse principal component regression, which integrates dimension reduction and prediction, yields higher errors and unstable factor loadings. This empirical comparison between reduce-then-predict and simultaneous reduce-and-predict approaches contributes to sparse modeling and engineering analytics, offering actionable insights for improving sequential R&D processes across high-tech industries, software engineering, construction, and other sectors where early performance predictions are critical.

AB  - Model Interpretability is critical for analyzing the potential risks inherent to the utilization of black-box neural networks in the medical domain. The current methodologies for Parkinson's disease (PD) detection require expertise from medical professionals alongside an expensive and time-consuming procedure. AI-driven Deep Learning (DL) models have generated state-of-the-art performance and have the potential to improve the process of PD detection by leveraging the early stage symptom of vocal deterioration to enable early identification of the disease. However, the potential of DL for PD selection has remained untapped thus far because of the lack of model interpretability and the possibility of even an accurate model failing to capture the correct causal relationship between the input signal and the prediction. This work implements a neural network that contains vowel phonations. The model achieved a classification accuracy of 90.32% with a precision, recall and F1 Score of 0.91, 0.90 and 0.905. A novel model interpretation algorithm is proposed that divides the audio file into logical chunks and provides a category label identifying the productivity of each chunk towards correct inference. This is based on its interactions with every other audio region in the file, and the effective change of model performance and confidence with its inclusion. An audio instance within a clip is significant for desired output only in conjunction with other audio regions that together generate a meaningful pattern indicating the existence of PD. The algorithm also ranks all audio chunks in the order of their importance to the correct prediction by analyzing the degree in which their impact varies when combined with other audio regions. This paper demonstrates that DL can be leveraged to create a reliable, accurate, and efficient method for PD Detection and the model can be extended to provide interpretability to the inferences in a way that is scalable, and free from bias.

AB  - Credit risk prediction is a critical task in the financial industry, allowing lenders to assess the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. Traditional machine learning (ML) classifiers have been widely used for this purpose, and they often struggle with imbalanced data and lack interpretability, making it challenging for financial institutions to make informed decisions. This article explores the use of ensemble classifiers and Synthetic minority over-sampling Edited nearest neighbor (SMOTE-ENN) technique in credit risk prediction, aiming to improve the classification performance. The ensemble classifiers include Random Forest, adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM). The study addresses the class imbalance issue by leveraging ensemble classifiers and the SMOTE-ENN technique while employing Shapley additive exPlanations (SHAP) for model interpretability. The experimental results showed that the proposed approach resulted in improved classification performance. Specifically, on the German credit dataset, XGBoost outperformed the other models with a Recall of 0.930 and a Specificity of 0.846, while Random Forest obtained the best performance on the Australian dataset, achieving a Recall of 0.907 and Specificity of 0.922. Additionally, the integration of SHAP enhanced the models’ transparency by providing valuable insights into the contribution of individual features, which is crucial for informed financial decision-making.

AB  - This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the evolution of Machine Learning (ML), from traditional to advanced, in its application and integration into unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication frameworks and practical applications. The manuscript starts with an overview of the existing research on UAV communication and introduces the most traditional ML techniques. It then discusses UAVs as versatile actors in mobile networks, assuming different roles from airborne user equipment (UE) to base stations (BS). UAV have demonstrated considerable potential in addressing the evolving challenges of next-generation mobile networks, such as enhancing coverage and facilitating temporary hotspots but pose new hurdles including optimal positioning, trajectory optimization, and energy efficiency. We therefore conduct a comprehensive review of advanced ML strategies, ranging from federated learning, transfer and meta-learning to explainable AI, to address those challenges. Finally, the use of state-of-the-art ML algorithms in these capabilities is explored and their potential extension to cloud and/or edge computing based network architectures is highlighted.

AB  - In recent times, both geopolitical challenges and the need to counteract climate change have led to an increase in generated renewable energy as well as an increased demand for clean electrical energy. The resulting variability of electricity production and demand as well as an overall demand increase, put additional stress on the existing grid infrastructure. This leads to strongly increased maintenance demands for distribution system operators (DSOs). Today, condition monitoring is used to address these challenges. Researchers have already explored solutions for monitoring critical assets like switchgear and circuit breakers. However, with a shrinking knowledgeable technical workforce and increasing maintenance requirements, mere monitoring is insufficient. Already today, DSOs ask for actionable recommendations, optimization strategies, and prioritization methods to manage the growing task backlog effectively. In this paper we propose a vision of a grid-level cognitive assistance system that translates the outcome of diagnosis and prognosis systems into actionable work tasks for the grid operator. The solution is highly interdisciplinary and based on empirical studies of real-world requirements. We also describe the related work relevant to the multi-disciplinary aspects and summarize the research gaps that need to be closed over the next years.

AB  - There is a direct correlation between noise and human health, while negative consequences may vary from sleep disruption and stress to hearing loss and reduced productivity. Despite its undeniable relevance, the underlying process governing the relationship between unpleasant sound events, and the annoyance they may cause has not been systematically studied yet. In this context, this work focuses on the disturbance caused by interfloor sound events, i.e., the audio signals transmitted through the floors of a building. Activities such as walking, running, using household appliances or other daily actions generate sounds that can be heard by those on an adjacent floor. To this end, we implemented a suitable dataset including diverse interfloor sound events annotated according to the perceived disturbance. Subsequently, we propose a framework able to quantify similarities exhibited by interfloor sound events starting from standardized time-frequency representations, which are processed by a Siamese neural network composed of a series of convolutional layers. Such similarities are then employed by a $k$-medoids regression scheme making disturbance predictions based on interfloor sound events with neighboring latent representations. After thorough experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of such a framework and its superiority over popular regression algorithms. Last but not least, the proposed solution offers interpretable predictions, which may be meaningfully utilized by human experts.

AB  - Bearing systems are critical components in smart manufacturing conveyors, where unplanned failures can lead to significant downtime and costs. Traditional condition-based maintenance (CBM) methods lack scalability in dynamic, sensor-rich environments. This paper presents a Bearing Edge Analytics and Condition Observation Network (BEACON) framework real-time monitoring and fault detection. BEACON employs advanced sensor networks, unsupervised and supervised learning models, and explainable AI techniques to enhance interpretability. Experimental validation on a Festo conveyor system demonstrated that BEACON archieved 95% accuracy in vibration-based fault detection, with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models achieving the highest anomaly detection performance (94%). The results highlight the potential of BEACON for scalable, real-time predictive maintenance in Industry 4.0 applications.

AB  - The lack of transparency and clarity in AI decisionmaking poses challenges of ethics and trust. This article presents $K A N$, a class of networks developed by Ziming Liu among other researchers recently based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, designed to improve the performance and interpretability of classic $A I$ algorithms. This article explains $K A N$ in an understandable way, with examples and addresses the binary classification problem. The results show that $K A N$ are competitive against other classification algorithms with the advantage that they are highly interpretable. Furthermore, in the datasets studied the $K A N$ surpassed the MLP in the Friedman ranking. Moreover, it was found that its performance is similar, statistically speaking, to that of state-of-the-art classification algorithms. Therefore, KAN are a clear alternative when high performance and interpretability are required without the need to resort to post hoc tests.

AB  - Downtime caused by equipment failure is the biggest productivity problem in the 24-hour a day operations of the semiconductor industry. Although some equipment failures are inevitable, increases in productivity can be gained if the causes of failures can be detected quickly and repaired, thus reducing downtime. Univariate control charts are commonly used to detect failures. However, because of the complexity of the process and the structural characteristics of the equipment, detection and identification of the causes of failures may be difficult. The purpose of this study is to use correlations of variables to detect failures in semiconductor equipment, to predict the parts to be replaced and to identify the primary causes of failures. The proposed method consists of four steps: (1) conversion of the multivariate time series data of the equipment into signature matrixes, (2) detection of anomalies through a convolutional autoencoder, (3) learning classification models with supervised learning methods that use the residual matrixes of fault sections, and (4) application of an explainable algorithm to interpret the classification model. The effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method are demonstrated by the actual multivariate time series data obtained from 8-inch ashing process equipment that produces semiconductors on 8-inch silicon wafers.

AB  - Digital twin models are of high interest to Head and Neck Cancer (HNC) oncologists, who have to navigate a series of complex treatment decisions that weigh the efficacy of tumor control against toxicity and mortality risks. Evaluating individual risk profiles necessitates a deeper understanding of the interplay between different factors such as patient health, spatial tumor location and spread, and risk of subsequent toxicities that can not be adequately captured through simple heuristics. To support clinicians in better understanding tradeoffs when deciding on treatment courses, we developed DITTO, a digital-twin and visual computing system that allows clinicians to analyze detailed risk profiles for each patient, and decide on a treatment plan. DITTO relies on a sequential Deep Reinforcement Learning digital twin (DT) to deliver personalized risk of both long-term and short-term disease outcome and toxicity risk for HNC patients. Based on a participatory collaborative design alongside oncologists, we also implement several visual explainability methods to promote clinical trust and encourage healthy skepticism when using our system. We evaluate the efficacy of DITTO through quantitative evaluation of performance and case studies with qualitative feedback. Finally, we discuss design lessons for developing clinical visual XAI applications for clinical end users.

AB  - Currently, the diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is dependent upon a subjective, time-consuming evaluation of behavioral tests by an expert clinician. Non-invasive functional MRI (fMRI) characterizes brain connectivity and may be used to inform diagnoses and democratize medicine. However, successful construction of predictive models, such as deep learning models, from fMRI requires addressing key choices about the model's architecture, including the number of layers and number of neurons per layer. Meanwhile, deriving functional connectivity (FC) features from fMRI requires choosing an atlas with an appropriate level of granularity. Once an accurate diagnostic model has been built, it is vital to determine which features are predictive of ASD and if similar features are learned across atlas granularity levels. Identifying new important features extends our understanding of the biological underpinnings of ASD, while identifying features that corroborate past findings and extend across atlas levels instills model confidence. To identify aptly suited architectural configurations, probability distributions of the configurations of high versus low performing models are compared. To determine the effect of atlas granularity, connectivity features are derived from atlases with 3 levels of granularity and important features are ranked with permutation feature importance. Results show the highest performing models use between 2-4 hidden layers and 16-64 neurons per layer, granularity dependent. Connectivity features identified as important across all 3 atlas granularity levels include FC to the supplementary motor gyrus and language association cortex, regions whose abnormal development are associated with deficits in social and sensory processing common in ASD. Importantly, the cerebellum, often not included in functional analyses, is also identified as a region whose abnormal connectivity is highly predictive of ASD. Results of this study identify important regions to include in future studies of ASD, help assist in the selection of network architectures, and help identify appropriate levels of granularity to facilitate the development of accurate diagnostic models of ASD.

AB  - This research evaluates the explainability of rules obtained in Neuro-Fuzzy (NF) models in hydrological time series forecasting. Thus, three NF models (Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and two versions of the Self-Identification Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Model (SINFIM)) were developed, considering the rain-runoff modeling as a particular case. The ANFIS model had the lowest performance, with many fuzzy rules challenging to interpret. The SINFIM 01 model performed best, but not all fuzzy rules were well explained. However, the SINFIM 02 model had a lower performance than the SINFIM 01 model but with more explainable fuzzy rules. With the examples developed, it is highlighted that within the NF models, it is necessary to focus on their performance during the forecast and look for a trade-off with explainability, thus taking advantage of their characteristic of more transparency than the black-box models.

AB  - Different explainable techniques have been introduced to overcome the challenges in complex machine learning models, such as uncertainty and lack of interpretability in sensitive processes. This paper presents an interpretable deep-leaning-based fault detection approach for two separate but relatively sensitive use cases. The first use case includes a vessel engine that aims to replicate a real-life ferry crossing. Furthermore, the second use case is an industrial, medical device assembly line that mounts and engages different product components. In this approach, first, we investigate two deep-learning models that can classify the samples as normal and abnormal. Then different explainable algorithms are studied to explain the prediction outcome for both models. Furthermore, the quantitative and qualitative evaluations of these methods are also carried on. Ultimately the deep learning model with the best-performing explainable algorithm is chosen as the final interpretable fault detector. However, depending on the use case, diverse classifiers and explainable techniques should be selected. For example, for the fault detection of the medical device assembly, the DeepLiftShap algorithm is most aligned with the expert knowledge and therefore has higher qualitative results. On the other hand, the Occlusion algorithm has lower sensitivity, and therefore, higher quantitative results. Consequently, choosing the final explainable algorithm compromises the qualitative and quantitative performance of the method.

AB  - Preserving cultural heritage structures is vital for maintaining historical integrity and promoting tourism. Advanced deep learning models enable precise defect detection, which is crucial for timely maintenance and preservation. This paper presents HERITAGE WATCH AI, an innovative project that leverages deep learning models to improve structural health monitoring through the development of PreserveNet. Our approach utilizes CNN-Convolutional Neural Network, specifically a combination of InceptionV3 and Grad-CAM for visualizing salient image regions using additional Resnet layers. PreserveNet helps in accurately classifying the input images of heritage sites into two primary categories: images with damage and images without damage. Upon detecting damage, the model further classifies damages into two distinct categories: structural defects (cracks, missing elements) and environmental defects (stains, yellowing, and plant moss). Further, the implementation results prove that PreserveNet exhibits impressive accuracy in training (97.85%) and validation (99.21%). The proposed model, PreserveNet can also be employed in construction site quality maintenance, ensuring ongoing structural integrity in real time.

AB  - Understanding the spatial and temporal patterns of environmental exposure to radio-frequency electromagnetic fields (RF - EMF) is essential for conducting risk assessments. These assessments aim to explore potential connections between RF-EMF exposure and its effects on human health, as well as on wildlife and plant life. Existing research has used different machine learning tools for EMF exposure estimation; however, a comparative analysis of these techniques is required to better understand their performance for real-world datasets. In this work, we present both finite and infinite-width convolutional network-based methods to estimate and assess EMF exposure levels from 70 real-world sensors in Lille, France. A comparative analysis has been conducted to analyze the performance of the methods' execution time and estimation accuracy. To improve estimation accuracy for higher-resolution grids, we utilized a preconditioned gradient descent method for kernel estimation. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is used as the evaluation criterion for comparing the performance of these deep learning models.

AB  - The lack of attendance of employees is called absenteeism and occurs for various reasons, such as vigorous physical activity, advanced age and high psychological demands of the work. The absenteeism affects the direct and indirect costs of the companies, and may reach 15% of the payroll. Therefore, it is fundamental to know its main causes and contribute to control and mitigation strategies. Neural networks have been successfully applied in the classification of several problems, but they are black boxes, because they do not explain which aspects are considered in their decisions. This aspect is very important in health applications, in which it is necessary to explain and clearly interpret the results. In this context, this work presents an approach to classify absenteeism through neural networks and Layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) aggregation in order to identify the most relevant features and to assign relevance scores individually per class and among all classes. The proposed approach was assessed by considering a dataset widely used as a benchmark and compared to the existing literature methods. The proposed approach presented the highest assertiveness rates among the compared methods, reaching an average accuracy of 0.83, identifying the most relevant features for the classification of absenteeism through a relevance score. Therefore, the results allow the interpretability of the causes of each class of absenteeism, which contribute to the management of human resources, occupational medicine and the development of strategies for its mitigation.

AB  - Belief rule base (BRB) has attracted considerable interest due to its interpretability and exceptional modeling accuracy. Generally, BRB construction relies on prior knowledge or historical data. The limitations of knowledge constrain the knowledge-based BRB and are unsuitable for use in large-scale rule bases. Data-driven techniques excel at extracting model parameters from data, thus significantly improving the accuracy of BRB. However, the previous data-based BRBs neglected the study of interpretability, and some still depend on prior knowledge or introduce additional parameters. All these factors make the BRB highly problem-specific and limit its broad applicability. To address these problems, a model-agnostic statistical BRB (MAS-BRB) modeling approach is proposed in this article. It adopts an MAS methodology for parameter extraction, ensuring that the parameters both fulfill their intended roles within the BRB framework and accurately represent complex, nonlinear data relationships. A comprehensive interpretability analysis of MAS-BRB components further confirms their compliance with established BRB interpretability standards. Experiments conducted on multiple public datasets demonstrate that MAS-BRB not only achieves improved modeling performance but also shows greater effectiveness compared to existing rule-based and traditional machine learning models.

AB  - Data-driven policy development and investment are necessary for aligning policies across administrative levels, targeting interventions, and meeting the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. However, local-level economic well-being data at timely intervals, critical to informing policy development and ensuring equity of outcomes, are unavailable in many parts of the world. Yet, filling these data gaps with black-box predictive models like neural networks introduces risk and inequity to the decision- making process. In this work, we construct an alternative interpretable model to these black-box models to predict household wealth, a key socioeconomic well-being indicator, at 5-km scale from widely available satellite data. Our interpretable model promotes transparency, the identification of potential drivers of bias and harmful outcomes, and inclusive design for human-ML decision-making. We model household wealth as a low- order function of productive land use that can be interpreted and integrated with domain knowledge by decision-makers. We aggregate remotely sensed land cover change data from 2006–2019 to construct an interpretable linear regression model for household wealth and wealth change in Uganda at a 5-km scale with  $r^{2}\,\,{=}$  72%. Our results demonstrate that there is not a clear performance-interpretability tradeoff in modeling household wealth from satellite imagery at high spatial and temporal resolution. Finally, we recommend a tiered framework to model socioeconomic outcomes from remote sensing data.

AB  - Accurate short-term solar photovoltaic (PV) forecasting remains challenging due to rapid fluctuations in irradiance caused by cloud dynamics. To address this, we propose CL-SUNSET, a novel 15-minute-ahead forecasting framework that integrates self-supervised contrastive learning with a CNN-based regression model, effective learning from unlabeled ground-based sky images. The model first extracts features using a contrastive learning module encoder, which are then combined with CNN-extracted spatial features and historical PV logs for regression. Empirical evaluations on two datasets—a subtropical climate dataset, Taipei-based, and a warm Mediterranean dataset, Stanford. The results demonstrate the superior performance of CL-SUNSET. On the Taipei-based dataset, it achieves an Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 14.266 W and a forecast skill (FS) of +5.17%, outperforming the baseline CNN with −14.51% FS. On the Stanford dataset, CL-SUNSET attains an RMSE of 3.081 kW and an FS of +30.48%, compared to −14.20% from the CNN. The model maintains robustness across weather conditions and forecast horizons, with FS increasing from +1.85% (5 min) to +10.37% (30 min) in Taipei, and from +15.88% to +49.83% in Stanford. Furthermore, t-SNE visualizations of contrastive representations reveal coherent temporal clustering, indicating that the model learns temporal continuity without providing any time series. These results highlight the promise of contrastive self-supervised learning for enhancing forecast accuracy, data efficiency, and interpretability in PV power prediction.

AB  - The realization of third-generation artificial intelligence (AI) requires the evolution from perceptual intelligence to cognitive intelligence; in this context, knowledge graphs may no longer meet practical needs. Based on dual channel theory, cognitive graphs are established and developed by coordinating an implicit extraction module and an explicit reasoning module, as well as integrating knowledge graphs, cognitive reasoning, and logical expressions, which have achieved successes in multi-hop question answering. The widespread use of cognitive graphs in advanced AI applications (e.g., large-scale knowledge representations and intelligent responses) is desirable, which will promote the development of AI dramatically. This review discusses cognitive graphs systematically and elaborately, including their basic concepts, generation, theories, and technologies. Moreover, we try to predict the development of cognitive intelligence in the short-term future and further encourage more research works and studies.

AB  - Cost functions serve as the backbone of machine learning models, guiding optimization processes and significantly influencing predictive accuracy and model generalization. This review presents a comprehensive analysis of cost function design and application across a broad spectrum of engineering and applied science domains, including manufacturing, structural mechanics, computational design, biomechanics, reinforcement learning, and construction management. By synthesizing insights from 20 recent studies, the paper explores how cost functions are formulated, adapted, and optimized to suit complex, domain-specific challenges— ranging from estimating machining costs using explainable AI to learning physical laws via energy-based deep learning methods. Special attention is given to the integration of traditional engineering knowledge into data-driven models, the role of interpretability in cost function design, and the emergence of hybrid frameworks combining physical simulation with neural architectures. This work highlights both the diversity and convergence of cost function methodologies, identifies trends in scalable and interpretable modeling, and outlines research directions for the development of adaptive, data-efficient, and context-aware cost functions in engineering applications.

AB  - Association Rule Mining is a machine learning method for discovering the interesting relations between the attributes in a huge transaction database. Typically, algorithms for Association Rule Mining generate a huge number of association rules, from which it is hard to extract structured knowledge and present this automatically in a form that would be suitable for the user. Recently, an information cartography has been proposed for creating structured summaries of information and visualizing with methodology called “metro maps”. This was applied to several problem domains, where pattern mining was necessary. The aim of this study is to develop a method for automatic creation of metro maps of information obtained by Association Rule Mining and, thus, spread its applicability to the other machine learning methods. Although the proposed method consists of multiple steps, its core presents metro map construction that is defined in the study as an optimization problem, which is solved using an evolutionary algorithm. Finally, this was applied to four well-known UCI Machine Learning datasets and one sport dataset. Visualizing the resulted metro maps not only justifies that this is a suitable tool for presenting structured knowledge hidden in data, but also that they can tell stories to users.

AB  - Machine learning, especially deep learning, has been extensively applied and studied in the area of machine health monitoring. For machine health monitoring systems (MHMS), major efforts have been put into designing and deploying more and more complex machine learning models. Those black-box models are nontransparent toward their working mechanism. However, this research trend brings huge potential risks in real life. Since machine health monitoring itself belongs to high stake decision applications, the outputs of the autonomous monitoring systems should be trustworthy and reliable, which refers to obtain explainability. Then, it comes to the following key question: why the deployed MHMS predicts what they predict. In this article, we shed some light on this meaningful research direction: explainable MHMSs (EMHMS). In EMHMS, the machine doctor could act like a real doctor who can not only make a diagnosis but also describe the patient's symptoms. First, we propose a specific convolutional neural network (CNN) structure, named DecouplEd Feature-Temporal CNN (DEFT-CNN), to balance precision-explainability tradeoff. Specifically, feature information and temporal information have been encoded in different stages of our model. The spatial attention module is added to boost the performance of the model. Then, to explain the decision of the model, we adopt gradient-based methods to generate features and temporal saliency maps highlighting which kinds of features and time steps are keys for the model's predictions. Finally, we conduct the experimental studies on two real datasets to verify the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

AB  - Inventory represents the largest asset in pharmacy products distribution. Forecasting pharmacy purchases is essential to keep an effective stock balancing supply and demand besides minimizing costs. In this work, we investigate how to forecast product purchases for a pharmaceutical distributor. The data contains inventory sale histories for more than 10 thousand active products during the past 15 years. We discuss challenges on data preprocessing of the pharmacy data including cleaning, feature constructions and selections, as well as processing data during the COVID period. We experimented on different machine learning and deep learning neural network models to predict future purchases for each product, including classical Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA), Prophet from Facebook, linear regression, Random Forest, XGBoost and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). We demonstrate that a carefully designed SARIMA model outperformed the others on the task, and weekly prediction models perform better than daily predictions.

AB  - Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication has provided a solution for the improvement of the traffic efficiency of smart city intersections. For example, turning maneuvers prediction at signalized intersections in a connected environment helps traffic command centers time traffic lights and dynamically predict traffic flow. However, the modeling methods used in existing research on this topic have some limitations, such as poor scalability and interpretability of machine learning. Thus, this study proposes a dictionary learning-based approach to predict turning maneuvers before the intersection. The proposed dictionary model estimates the LogDet divergence-based sparse inverse covariance matrix (LDbSICM) of driving behavior samples. The graphical lasso method is used to estimate the sparse inverse covariance matrix of the driving samples to construct a dictionary library of the maneuver behavior. The LogDet divergence is used to calculate the difference between each inverse covariance matrix. A driving simulator is utilized to collect experimental data consisting of turning left (TL), turning right (TR), and going straight (GS) behaviors to establish and evaluate the proposed model. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed dictionary learning-based turning maneuver prediction model achieves 100% prediction accuracy for TL and GS and 97.2% for TR. The proposed model has substantial advantages over existing methods. The model can predict TL, TR, and GS in a connected environment 270, 280, and 290 m, respectively, before the intersection.

AB  - The current trend in machine learning is to use powerful algorithms to induce complex predictive models that often fall under the category of “black-box models”. Thanks to this, there is also a growing interest in studying model explainabil-ity and interpretability so that human experts can understand, validate, and correct those models. With the objective of promoting the creation of inherently interpretable models, we present M6GP. This wrapper-based multi-objective automatic feature engineering algorithm combines key components of the M3GP and NSGA-II algorithms. Wrapping M6GP around another machine learning algorithm evolves a set of features optimized for this algorithm while potentially increasing its robustness. We compare our results with M3GP and M4GP, two ancestors from the same algorithm family, and verify that, by using a multi-objective approach, M6GP obtains equal or better results. In addition, by using complexity metrics on the list of objectives, the M6GP models come down to one-fifth of the size of the M3GP models, making them easier to read by comparison.

AB  - Sustainable land-use planning and catastrophe risk reduction depend critically on landslide susceptibility mapping. The complex, nonlinear interconnections of environmental and human elements cause terrain instability and challenge conventional prediction methods. In this work, we offer a DeepLabV3+-based deep learning framework coupled with geographic information systems and multicriteria decision making methods for spatial prediction of landslide risk, over the Dubai coastal and urban region (covering approximately 4000 km2). The approach uses an annotated dataset for semantic segmentation and high-resolution satellite images from the Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Center. On Google Colab with GPU acceleration, the model is trained and verified and then further improved for computational efficiency on a Mac M1 machine. Our results show an overall accuracy of 91.3%, a mean intersection over union of 82.5%, and an F1-score of 88.4%, demonstrating strong classification performance throughout a range of land cover types. The confusion matrix analysis highlights strong segmentation accuracy for water bodies (94.2%) and structures (92.4%). Considerable misclassification between roadways and unpaved terrain results from spectral similarities. Furthermore, the perclass Dice Coefficient analysis confirms that the model can efficiently discriminate intricate topographical patterns. Especially in fast-expanding areas such as Dubai, UAE, it provides a scalable solution for landslide susceptibility mapping, catastrophe risk management, and sustainable urban design. Future work will explore multisensor data fusion, real-time inference, and applying explainable artificial intelligence techniques to enhance model interpretability in dynamic terrain settings.

AB  - Unsupervised learning has consistently been a chal-lenging aspect of machine learning, particularly in robotic tasks such as autonomous navigation, object grasping, and anomaly detection. These tasks require the system to identify patterns in data without any labeled examples, making it difficult to achieve reliable and accurate outcomes. In medical applications, such as tumor detection and segmentation, the difficulties of unsupervised learning become even more noticeable. Without labeled data to guide the models, discovering meaningful patterns often leads to poor interpretability, limiting the effectiveness of these systems in critical medical decision-making processes. In these contexts, transparency and understanding are essential, especially for safety-critical tasks. Recognizing this need, we introduce a novel two-phase clustering approach that combines latent space transformation using an autoencoder with weighted feature augmentation and post-clustering in the original feature space, thereby improving explainability by making the clusters more interpretable and highlighting key features for a better understanding of the results. Building on this, our method, applied to a real-world dataset characterized by complex human behaviors developed by our group, demonstrates superior performance with improved silhouette scores and comprehensive analysis, effectively capturing complex customer behaviors while enhancing interpretability and providing key insights for data-driven decisions.

AB  - Using the idea of a honeynet, this study aims to build a realistic replica of an industrial setting in order to lure and capture would-be attackers. Hackers unintentionally reveal their strategies, methods, and processes by penetrating this honeypot’s structure, which helps with awareness of situations and detection of intrusions. To apply the XIDS to industry cyber-physical systems (ICPS), this study developed two new stages of approach. These approaches include the chi-square info gain, and gain ratio. The suggested approach improves the efficacy and precision of ICPS threat detection by picking discriminative characteristics. For detecting breaches using ICPS, the Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory Model (BiLSTM) model has been fine-tuned and optimized. The models that were trained on a large dataset of ICPS traffic data, have a better capacity to distinguish between benign and illicit behaviour, which improves the effectiveness of detection and reduces false positives. Hyper-parameters adjustment in the Bi-LSTM model is carried out using the Bayesian optimization approach in this manner. It follows a comparison with the GRU and LSTM single classifiers. Performing better than competing models like GRU, LSTM, and BI-LSTM, the suggested BO-BI-LSTM approach attains a remarkable total accuracy of $99.42 \%$. The remarkable precision and resilience of detection of intrusions in manufacturing cyber-physical structures are amplified by the combined efforts of Explainable AI-based Ensemble Filter Feature Selection (XAI-EFFS) and Bayesian optimizing, which effectively fine-tune the model’s hyperparameters.

AB  - Learning from complex real-life networks is a lively research area, with recent advances in learning information-rich, low-dimensional network node representations. However, state-of-the-art methods are not necessarily interpretable and are therefore not fully applicable to sensitive settings in biomedical or user profiling tasks, where explicit bias detection is highly relevant. The proposed SNoRe (Symbolic Node Representations) algorithm is capable of learning symbolic, human-understandable representations of individual network nodes, based on the similarity of neighborhood hashes which serve as features. SNoRe's interpretable features are suitable for direct explanation of individual predictions, which we demonstrate by coupling it with the widely used instance explanation tool SHAP to obtain nomograms representing the relevance of individual features for a given classification. To our knowledge, this is one of the first such attempts in a structural node embedding setting. In the experimental evaluation on eleven real-life datasets, SNoRe proved to be competitive to strong baselines, such as variational graph autoencoders, node2vec and LINE. The vectorized implementation of SNoRe scales to large networks, making it suitable for contemporary network learning and analysis tasks.

AB  - Overreliance on traditional energy sources leads to resource depletion and environmental pollution, posing serious challenges to global energy security. In response, Floating Photovoltaic (FPV) technology has emerged as a promising solution, offering an alternative to traditional ground-mounted Photovoltaic (PV) systems. This study utilizes data collected from Brookhall Estate between September 2022 and January 2023, employing six machine learning algorithms and the interpretable SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) technique to analyze solar radiation convertibility. Random Forest is identified as the most reliable model for FPV prediction. The results highlight the nonlinear impact of factors such as temperature, conductivity, seasonal variations, water depth, and wind direction on solar radiation collection efficiency. Targeted strategies for FPV design and placement are proposed, contributing to overall FPV optimization in alignment with sustainable energy development goals and the pursuit of net-zero emissions.

AB  - Intrusion event detection in distributed fiber optic sensing systems plays a vital role in urban emergency management and public safety. However, current AI-based systems face high false positive and false negative rates, as well as limited generalizability, due to variations in dataset quality, processing methods, and model architectures. To address these issues, we propose the Riemannian-Transformer-OTDR (RTO) model, an explainable deep-learning approach based on Riemannian manifolds. By exploiting the manifold space, our method identifies stable latent representations of dynamic data distributions from similar events, embedding intrusion detection within this latent manifold. The RTO model accurately identifies identical event types across diverse scenarios, reducing misclassification rates and enhancing model stability. Field tests using a distributed fiber optic sensing system validated the effectiveness of RTO: it achieved 98.43% accuracy in a subway construction scenario and demonstrated its cross-scenario generalization ability by maintaining 94.21% accuracy in gas pipeline monitoring, with 80.79% accuracy in a 100% noisy environment. Additionally, signal structure analysis of misclassified samples revealed insights into the model’s learning process. Our analysis of performance degradation across scenarios and noise levels further clarifies the RTO mechanisms and explainability. Ultimately, the RTO enables precise, retraining-free intrusion event classification across multiple scenarios, offering a practical solution for rapid event detection deployment in various domains.

AB  - The progression of artificial intelligence, particularly in healthcare domain, has brought significant progress to treatment, drug discovery, disease diagnosis and more. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a scenario-based preferences risk register framework for quantifying AI related risks in disease diagnosis. Two case studies, one involving physician and the other one with involving patients as the main stakeholders, are compared to evaluate the effectiveness of the framework and to evaluate how the initiatives ranking orders will evolve based on the most and least disruptive scenarios for each cases. The framework is applied to realistic case studies on cardiac sarcoidosis, identifying success criteria, initiatives, emergent conditions, and the most and least disruptive scenarios. The success criteria align with the National Institute of Standards and Technology AI Risk Management Framework (NIST AI RMF) seven trustworthy AI characteristics. Finally, the framework identifies the most and least disruptive scenarios and the most important initiatives for both cases. Results show that Non-Interpretable AI and Lack of Human-AI Communications, Privacy Attacks, and Human Errors in Design, Develop, Measurement and Implementation are the most disruptive scenarios in both cases, however, scenario Cyber Security Threats also counted as other most disruptive scenarios to the initiatives ranked by patients. This adaptable framework has the potential not only to transfer findings to global healthcare systems but also to extend its effectiveness to various other domains, such as transportation, finance, environment, and design.

To this end, we present the results of a post-hoc self-assessment to evaluate the trustworthiness of an AI system for predicting a multiregional score conveying the degree of lung compromise in COVID-19 patients, developed and verified by an interdisciplinary team with members from academia, public hospitals, and industry in time of pandemic. The AI system aims to help radiologists to estimate and communicate the severity of damage in a patient’s lung from Chest X-rays. It has been experimentally deployed in the radiology department of the ASST Spedali Civili clinic in Brescia, Italy, since December 2020 during pandemic time. The methodology we have applied for our post-hoc assessment, called Z-Inspection®, uses sociotechnical scenarios to identify ethical, technical, and domain-specific issues in the use of the AI system in the context of the pandemic.

AB  - The complexity of the communication between electronic control units in contemporary vehicles is increasing with the rising demand of customer functions such as automated driving and infotainment resulting in up to several thousand data elements (signals) per data bus. Consequently, engineers have no choice but to apply data science methods to extract meaningful insights from this high-dimensional communication data, particularly before training machine learning models. A critical step in this process is identifying the bus signals relevant for a specific data science task. Extracting them manually is not only time-consuming but it also demands a high degree of in-vehicle communication knowledge which is hard to obtain. To address this challenge, we propose an automated feature engineering approach that leverages reinforcement learning combined with state-of-the-art feature selection and engineering methods and a tunable sampling rate for the bus data. Due to the high degree of automation it requires little prior knowledge of how in-vehicle communication works. Our method enhances important key performance indicators for machine learning model quality for the task of energy consumption prognosis and significantly reduces the number of bus signals required for accurate model predictions. This approach does not only improve the understanding of relevant data but also reduces the model's size as less features are used for the prediction, leading to more efficient and interpretable machine learning solutions.

AB  - Early diagnosis of melanoma is important for patient care, but dermatologists are struggling to keep up with the increasing demand for skin disease care. Computer-aided diagnostic techniques can be used to assist physicians in diagnosis using non-invasive dermoscopy. In this thesis, deep learning techniques are utilized to improve the speed of melanoma diagnosis, alleviate the low accuracy of dermatology datasets due to class imbalance, and combine with a 7-point checklist for melanoma to propose an end-to-end, multi-task, interpretable deep learning diagnostic model. The model consists of three parts: class balancing module, course learning fusion module, and diagnostic decoder, which makes scores for the 7 features of melanoma, and combines the scores and image features to make the final diagnosis, with an average accuracy as high as 74.43%. The experimental results show that the model effectively improves the interpretability of deep learning while ensuring accuracy, and analyzes its advantages in practical applications.

AB  - In this paper, a novel single-index model tree (SIMTree) is proposed. It adopts the recursive partitioning strategy and each data segment is modeled by a single-index model (SIM), which is a flexible extension of linear regression with non-parametric link functions. The proposed SIMTree has two major advantages: a) with only a few leaf nodes, it can achieve competitive predictive performance compared to complicated black-box models; b) SIMs fitted on each local data segment are intrinsically interpretable. However, using conventional techniques to build such a SIMTree can be extremely time-consuming. SIM estimation typically involves iterative optimization via Newton-type algorithms; such a resource-intensive estimation procedure is repeatedly used for fitting leaf node SIMs and the search of optimal splits. To make the computation burden affordable, an effective training algorithm is proposed as enabled by the efficient utilization of Stein's lemma and several accelerating strategies in the tree construction algorithm. Moreover, a new Python package simtree is developed with elegant visualization modules that can further facilitate the model interpretation. Numerical results on extensive regression datasets show that SIMTree is an accurate and interpretable machine learning model.

AB  - Skin lesion segmentation plays a crucial role in the computer-aided diagnosis of melanoma. Deep Learning models have shown promise in accurately segmenting skin lesions, but their widespread adoption in real-life clinical settings is hindered by their inherent black-box nature. In domains as critical as healthcare, interpretability is not merely a feature but a fundamental requirement for model adoption. This paper proposes IARS SegNet an advanced segmentation framework built upon the SegNet baseline model. Our approach incorporates three critical components: Skip connections, residual convolutions, and a global attention mechanism onto the baseline Segnet architecture. These elements play a pivotal role in accentuating the significance of clinically relevant regions, particularly the contours of skin lesions. The inclusion of skip connections enhances the model’s capacity to learn intricate contour details, while the use of residual convolutions allows for the construction of a deeper model while preserving essential image features. The global attention mechanism further contributes by extracting refined feature maps from each convolutional and deconvolutional block, thereby elevating the model’s interpretability. This enhancement highlights critical regions, fosters better understanding, and leads to more accurate skin lesion segmentation for melanoma diagnosis. This study primarily focuses on the interpretation of performance improvements in the base model resulting from the integration of each of these three components. To comprehensively assess the performance gain achieved with each addition, we employ two sets of evaluation metrics, quantifying performance based on both regions and contours. The results underscore the superior segmentation capabilities of the proposed architecture compared to the SegNet and U-Net models. Notably, the model’s performance gain due to each enhancement is visually interpretable.

AB  - Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a widespread hormonal disorder affecting numerous women with ovaries, during their reproductive ages, often leading to various complications if undiagnosed or improperly managed. This research aims to improve PCOS detection by utilizing an interpretable machine-learning framework for diagnostic assistance. We utilized a publicly available dataset from Kaggle, featuring 541 samples and 44 attributes. Various preprocessing techniques and feature selection methods, such as Chi-Square, Mutual Information, and Correlation Coefficient, were employed here. Subsequently, we trained multiple machine learning algorithms and subjected them to K-fold cross-validation. Their performance is evaluated and compared by accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Our findings reveal that the CatBoost algorithm, when paired with Chi-Square feature selection, achieved the highest accuracy rate of 93.9%. Our study focuses on investigating important features, comparing algorithm performance, and achieving high accuracy in PCOS detection. The research validates machine learning's effectiveness for non-invasive PCOS diagnosis, laying the groundwork for future medical diagnostics.

AB  - Modern high-precision manufacturing demands quality management systems that integrate advanced analytics with human expertise. Traditional, purely data-driven methodologies, including the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM), often fail to capture the operational complexities of today's manufacturing, leading to inefficient defect detection and limited process adaptability. This study proposes an extended human-in-the-loop (HITL)-CRISP-DM framework that synergizes domain-centric insights with data-driven analytics to address these challenges. The framework incorporates structured root cause analysis, iterative feedback loops, and dedicated systems engineering to bridge the gap between domain experts and data scientists. Application of the framework in hairpin welding processes demonstrated significant improvements in defect detection and operational efficiency. The integrated approach enhances quality management and lays the groundwork for scalable applications across various industries. Future adoption of such hybrid intelligence frameworks will be critical for evolving quality control methodologies in increasingly complex manufacturing environments.

AB  - Recent literature highlights the critical role of neighborhood construction in deriving model-agnostic explanations, with a growing trend toward deploying generative models to improve synthetic instance quality, especially for explaining text classifiers. These approaches overcome the challenges in neighborhood construction posed by the unstructured nature of texts, thereby improving the quality of explanations. However, the deployed generators are usually implemented via neural networks and lack inherent explainability, sparking arguments over the transparency of the explanation process itself. To address this limitation while preserving neighborhood quality, this paper introduces a probability-based editing method as an alternative to black-box text generators. This approach generates neighboring texts by implementing manipulations based on in-text contexts. Substituting the generator-based construction process with recur-sive probability-based editing, the resultant explanation method, XPROB (explainer with probability-based editing), exhibits com-petitive performance according to the evaluation conducted on two real-world datasets. Additionally, XPROB's fully transparent and more controllable construction process leads to superior stability compared to the generator-based explainers.

AB  - Deep learning based methods hold state-of-the-art results in low-level image processing tasks, but remain difficult to interpret due to their black-box construction. Unrolled optimization networks present an interpretable alternative to constructing deep neural networks by deriving their architecture from classical iterative optimization methods without use of tricks from the standard deep learning tool-box. So far, such methods have demonstrated performance close to that of state-of-the-art models while using their interpretable construction to achieve a comparably low learned parameter count. In this work, we propose an unrolled convolutional dictionary learning network (CDLNet) and demonstrate its competitive denoising and joint denoising and demosaicing (JDD) performance both in low and high parameter count regimes. Specifically, we show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art fully convolutional denoising and JDD models when scaled to a similar parameter count. In addition, we leverage the model’s interpretable construction to propose a noise-adaptive parameterization of thresholds in the network that enables state-of-the-art blind denoising performance, and near-perfect generalization on noise-levels unseen during training. Furthermore, we show that such performance extends to the JDD task and unsupervised learning.

AB  - This article proposes a human posture classification system to classify the four postures of standing, bending, sitting, and lying using three-dimensional (3-D) fuzzy body voxel features obtained from two cameras and hierarchical fuzzy classifiers (FCs). The system consists of four parts: human body segmentation, 3-D body voxel model construction, feature extraction, and classification. A region-dependent Gaussian mixture model with shadow removal is proposed for human body segmentation. The silhouette volume intersection method with computation speedup is then used to construct the 3-D body model using the segmented images from two cameras. After that, fuzzy 3-D body voxel features for posture classification are extracted from a minimum enclosed cube of the 3-D model. For classification, this article proposes an FC with soft margin minimization (FC-SMM) and its hierarchical structure to improve the classification performance. The consequent and antecedent parameters are optimized through a linear batch support vector machine and margin selective gradient descent algorithm, respectively. The FC-SMM also shows the advantage of model interpretability through visualization of the fuzzy rules. Experimental results of the comparison of different feature extraction methods and classifiers in different videos show the superiority of the proposed classification method.

AB  - Agriculture is pivotal for the economy of a country as it is a major source of food, employment and raw materials. However, challenges such as diseases, soil degradation, and water scarcity persist. Technology adoption can address these issues, improving production and quality. Machine learning, a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI), enables prediction, classification, and automation in agriculture. It optimizes irrigation, fertilization, and crop selection, aiding decision-making for food security and crop management. This study proposes two robust machine learning architectures for classification and regression based on distinct datasets. Firstly, we delve into a crop recommendation dataset obtained from Kaggle, consisting of various input attributes such as the pH of the soil, temperature, humidity, and nutrient levels. Leveraging machine learning classification techniques such as Extra Tree Classifier (ETC), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), we suggest twenty-two different crops founded on these inputs. Through the use of K-fold cross-validation, Explainable AI (XAI) and feature engineering, we identify the best-performing model, with Random Forest coming out on top scoring an accuracy of 99.7% with precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix. Secondly, we investigate wheat yield prediction data snagged from the World Bank and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), covering the years 1992-2013 for Pakistan. Using Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) to tackle data restrictions, we gauge wheat production for 2014-2024 and forecast the 2025 yield using machine learning regression models. Once again, using hyper parameter tuning with K-fold cross-validation, Support Vector Regressor (SVR) stands out as the top-performing model, achieving an accuracy of 99.9% with R2 Score. Transparency and confidence in agricultural decision-making are increased when machine learning decisions are made comprehensible using Explainable AI (XAI) approaches. Two widely used XAI approaches, namely Feature Importance and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) are used to interpret and explain outcomes of the proposed models. The study can increase agricultural productivity, minimize risks, enhance food security, and promote more environmentally friendly farming approaches.

AB  - The process of finding a diagnosis in the medical domain relies on implicit knowledge and the experience of a human expert. In this article, we report on the observation of human decision making, shown by the example of pathology. By tracking the diagnostic steps, individual building blocks are identified, which not only contribute to a diagnostic finding, but can also be used in the future to train and develop artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. This work also provides insights into the interaction of human experts regarding the observation time of so-called “hot spots,” the magnification used for specific findings, and the overall observation and decision path followed. The documentation scheme yields a standardized examination procedure that shows the concept the pathologist is actually looking for as well as the possible features of findings that can be identified. This contribution indicates how important visualization is for human-centered AI, and specifically for enabling human oversight with respect to AI implementation in high-stake areas, such as medicine.

AB  - False data injection attacks (FDIA) destroy the integrity of information transmission by evading the bad data detection mechanism, and thus affects the stability of power cyber-physical systems (PCPS). Existing studies simply introduce complex neural network models for FDIA detection, ignoring spatial-temporal correlation and interpretability of neural networks. As a result, the accuracy and reliability of false detection may be negatively affected. To address the challenges above, this paper proposes an interpretable deep learning framework based on the spatial-temporal attention mechanism. Firstly, based on the gated recurrent unit (GRU), a dual attention mechanism is designed by combining spatial and temporal features of deep neural network to dynamically mine the potential correlations between the FDIA detection and the input features. Besides, the quantification of attention weights is introduced to interpret the spatial-temporal correlations between normal and attack data, which can effectively enhance the interpretability and reliability of detection results. Finally, based on the IEEE 14-bus test system and real operation data, simulations are conducted and the results show that the proposed STAGN model can detect FDIA effectively, has higher accuracy and stability than the latest detection models, and also has reasonable interpretability.

AB  - Random Forest (RF) is an ensemble learning which creates multiple decision trees and combines their outputs for creating models with less over-fitting. In this study, we apply RF to model the remaining service life (RSL) of rural pavements, a critical factor for developing optimal maintenance strategies and ensuring long-lasting infrastructure. We utilize key variables such as asphalt concrete thickness, base thickness, and surface temperature, along with data from Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) measurements. RF demonstrated performance in predicting RSL with consistent accuracy across a variety of conditions. The ensemble nature of RF allows it to effectively manage complex interactions among variables and handle the inherent variability in pavement performance data which makes it well-suited for rural road networks, where environmental and material differences are significant. While some sensitivity to parameter adjustments was noted, the robustness and reliability of RF highlights its potential to be a transformative tool in rural pavement management.

AB  - There is a growing need to assist radiologists in performing X-ray readings and diagnoses fast, comfortably, and effectively. As radiologists strive to maximize productivity, it is essential to consider the impact of reading rooms in interpreting complex examinations and ensure that higher volume and reporting speeds do not compromise patient outcomes. Virtual Reality (VR) is a disruptive technology for clinical practice in assessing X-ray images. We argue that conjugating eye-tracking with VR devices and Machine Learning may overcome obstacles posed by inadequate ergonomic postures and poor room conditions that often cause erroneous diagnostics when professionals examine digital images.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized and transformed the landscape of software development and testing by introducing new efficiencies and capabilities through advancements like Generative AI (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs). While these technologies bring major benefits in terms of productivity, personalization, and innovation, they also raise critical ethical challenges, such as biases, lack of transparency, data privacy concerns, and potential negative societal impacts. This paper examines the ethical considerations involved in developing such advanced AI systems as well using AI systems within software development and testing. It explores existing ethical frameworks and principles provided by leading organizations, emphasizing core concepts like human-centered design, accountability, transparency, fairness, and privacy. Practical strategies for integrating ethical practices throughout the AI development lifecycle are discussed, with a strong emphasis on the need for continuous ethical evaluation. The paper explores the ethical landscape of AI in software development, addressing challenges like algorithmic bias, data security, and broader societal impacts. Real-world case studies presented in the paper demonstrate the consequences of neglecting ethical considerations. Looking forward, the paper suggests future directions, including the development of unified ethical standards, collaborative ethical auditing, regulatory advancements, and higher societal engagement.

AB  - Vision-based online defect recognition can provide insights for laser welding quality control systems. Although the visual signal contains richer quality information than the one-dimensional signal, the quality features contained in the visual signal are more abstract. To improve the explainability of current convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for laser welding defect recognition (LWDR), a class activation mapping method based on multi-scale fusion features (CAM-MSFF) is proposed. In addition, a multi-scale features adaptive fusion method is proposed with three steps of feature squeeze, feature mapping, and feature recalibrating. In order to facilitate the learning and utilization of multi-scale features by the proposed method, supervisory information is applied to multiple scales. The experimental results show that the proposed CAM-MSFF method has higher accuracy and convergence speed than the conventional model. The results of the explainability tests show that the proposed method can provide a more accurate and human-comprehensible explanation of the model’s decision basis.

AB  - Loan eligibility prediction is critical in the financial sector, directly influencing credit access and risk management. This study proposes a cost-sensitive stacking ensemble model that integrates fairness-aware preprocessing, explainable AI techniques, and a custom loss function to address key challenges in loan prediction. The model combines Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost as base learners with Ridge Regression as the meta-classifier, optimizing predictive accuracy, fairness, and interpretability. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms baseline methods, achieving higher accuracy (84.55%), F1-Score (90.85%), and lower log loss (0.3821). SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) provide feature-level insights, enhancing transparency and regulatory compliance. Additionally, fairness-aware preprocessing mitigates biases, promoting equitable credit access. The study contributes a practical, interpretable, and ethical solution for automating loan decisions, and addressing financial and societal objectives. Future work includes exploring dynamic data integration, broader fairness metrics, and scalability optimization.

AB  - In this study, we propose a new analysis method called Reverse contribution analysis (RCA) using approximate inverse model explanations (AIME) and use this method to clarify the relationship between remote work and mental health. AIME is an XAI method that visualizes the relationship between explanatory variables and estimated target variables for black-box models, making it possible to interpret the behavior of the model. Furthermore, if we assume an ideal black box model that can always derive accurate target variables, it becomes possible to directly visualize the contribution of target variables to explanatory variables. Based on this assumption, ICA quantitatively evaluates the contribution and direction of influence (positive or negative) of the explanatory variables based on the variability of the target variables. In this study, we used ICA to analyze which factors are related to work-life balance, stress levels, mental health status, and remote work satisfaction in a remote work environment. Specifically, we analyzed the impact of explanatory variables related to these objective variables using the Remote Work and Mental Health dataset, and the results showed that the industry, changes in productivity, experience and age are important factors. The results of this study provide important insights into improving remote work policies and employee support.

AB  - This paper proposes an attributable visual similarity learning (AVSL) framework for a more accurate and ex-plainable similarity measure between images. Most existing similarity learning methods exacerbate the unexplain-ability by mapping each sample to a single point in the em-bedding space with a distance metric (e.g., Mahalanobis distance, Euclidean distance). Motivated by the human se-mantic similarity cognition, we propose a generalized simi-larity learning paradigm to represent the similarity between two images with a graph and then infer the overall simi-larity accordingly. Furthermore, we establish a bottom-up similarity construction and top-down similarity inference framework to infer the similarity based on semantic hier-archy consistency. We first identify unreliable higher-level similarity nodes and then correct them using the most co-herent adjacent lower-level similarity nodes, which simulta-neously preserve traces for similarity attribution. Extensive experiments on the CUB-200-2011, Cars196, and Stanford Online Products datasets demonstrate significant improve-ments over existing deep similarity learning methods and verify the interpretability of our framework.11Code: https://github.com/zbr17/AVSL.

AB  - The Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure for Feature Selection (GRASP-FS) is a recently-proposed metaheuristic that optimizes the feature selection process for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) by combining exploration and refinement techniques for more assertive intrusion detection. However, GRASP-FS may be time and resource-consuming for large datasets. In this work, we propose GRASPQ-FS, an extended version of GRASP-FS using Priority Queues to reduce resource consumption and processing time. As an additional contribution, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the most suitable parameters for our GRASPQ-FS. Our results reveal that GRASPQ-FS can speed up feature selection up to 90% over GRASP-FS, without compromising F1-Score. Also, we observed that a priority queue with 50 solutions saved 50% in execution time while increasing the F1-Score by 4.5%.

AB  - In this research, we propose an explanatory model that learns combinations of microbiome signatures that help predict reduced multidrug resistance (MDR) of disease-causing pathogens. A twin regression network in our model provides a means for estimating the MDR presence using microbiome samples. Further, we extend our model by using a backtracking approach that determines the effect of specific microbiome signatures on the prevalence of MDR, to identify potential beneficial combinations. Using high-throughput Illumina sequencing of the 16SrRNA gene data from 41 pastured poultry flocks in southeastern U.S. farms, the regression model identifies the factors influencing MDR prevalence in common foodborne pathogens (Salmonella, Campylobacter, and Listeria) at different stages of poultry growth.

AB  - Detecting software vulnerabilities is critical for the security of modern complex software systems. However, it is challenging due to the complexity of codebases and limitations in existing methods. Traditional approaches often struggle to capture both semantic and structural dependencies effectively. To represent code semantics comprehensively, this paper presents a novel framework integrating Graph Attention Networks (GATs) with Code Property Graphs (CPGs), which unify Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs), Control Flow Graphs (CFGs), and Program Dependency Graphs (PDGs). Node embeddings are initialized using pretrained GraphCodeBERT, enhanced with multi-head attention layers, residual connections, and global attention pooling. GANbased data augmentation is employed to address the class imbalance, improving model robustness. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate a detection accuracy of 88.5 percent, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines such as CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT across multiple evaluation metrics, including precision, recall, and F1-score. Furthermore, interpretable attention mechanisms enable the prioritization of critical code regions, ensuring practical applicability. This work establishes a scalable and explainable AI-driven approach for vulnerability detection.

AB  - In control systems, accurate and timely diagnosis of malfunctions can ensure the safe and efficient operation of the systems. Although several methods have been proposed for process anomaly detection, including multivariate statistical process control, most of these models are built on several statistical assumptions that limit their applications. When these models detect faults with high accuracy, questions such as "How did the model achieve this outcome?" "Are the predictions valid?" and "Do the outcomes reveal novel information?" often race through our minds. Therefore, to ensure explainability in fault diagnosis of control systems, we propose a causal-based large language model that can potentially answer cause-and-effect questions within these systems, ensuring transparency, interpretability, and robustness.

Moreover, explainability in the field of machine learning is a challenging task that assists in decision formation along with transparency.We develop a machine learning pipeline with gradient boosted decision trees to mitigate service level failures in supply chains. Our framework is simple, easy to implement, and provides a promising result. It provides explainability to prevent service level failure in time sensitive supply chains such as food manufacturing. Our model can be used for rapid deployment with state-of-the-art prediction accuracy while establishing trust within the decision-makers.

AB  - Modular systems are increasingly employed in critical application domains such as healthcare, smart cities, and Industry 4.0 platforms, where dynamic integration of components poses substantial challenges in ensuring consistent and secure operation. Validating system configurations against known vulnerabilities and threats requires formal, scalable, and explainable approaches. This paper presents a knowledge-driven framework designed to support the validation of modular systems with respect to cybersecurity threats and consistency constraints. Our approach leverages domain-specific ontologies built from well-established threat and vulnerability taxonomies and encodes inference rules to automatically detect potential threats and recommend mitigation strategies. The framework, which includes a reasoning engine and a user-friendly graphical interface providing transparent and traceable explanations for each identified threat, is applied to a modular platform for privacy-preserving, decentralized processing of health data across European institutions. While this composable architecture enables multiple stakeholders to develop, deploy, and maintain specialised components fostering scalability and flexibility, it also introduces critical risks related to architectural coherence and security enforcement. In this context, our framework ensures a human-interpretable assessment of the system’s security posture, even in the presence of heterogeneous technologies and policies.

AB  - Practical data analysis scenarios involve more than just the interpretation of data through visual and algorithmic analysis. Many real-world analysis environments involve multiple types of experts and analysts working together to solve problems and make decisions, adding organizational and social requirements to the mix. We aim to provide new knowledge about the role of provenance for practical problems in a variety of analysis scenarios central to national security. We present the findings from interviews with data analysts from domains, such as intelligence analysis, cyber-security, and geospatial intelligence. In addition to covering multiple analysis domains, our study also considers practical workplace implications related to organizational roles and the level of analyst experience. The results demonstrate how different needs for provenance depend on different roles in the analysis effort (e.g., data analyst, task managers, data analyst trainers, and quality control analysts). By considering the core challenges reported along with an analysis of existing provenance-support techniques through existing research and systems, we contribute new insights about needs and opportunities for improvements to provenance-support methods.

AB  - As we transition from the 5G epoch, a new horizon beckons with the advent of 6G, seeking a profound fusion with novel communication paradigms and emerging technological trends, bringing once-futuristic visions to life along with added technical intricacies. Although analytical models lay the foundations and offer systematic insights, we have recently witnessed a noticeable surge in research suggesting machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) can efficiently deal with complex problems by complementing or replacing model-based approaches. The majority of data-driven wireless research leans heavily on discriminative AI (DAI) that requires vast real-world datasets. Unlike the DAI, Generative AI (GenAI) pertains to generative models (GMs) capable of discerning the underlying data distribution, patterns, and features of the input data. This makes GenAI a crucial asset in wireless domain wherein real-world data is often scarce, incomplete, costly to acquire, and hard to model or comprehend. With these appealing attributes, GenAI can replace or supplement DAI methods in various capacities. Accordingly, this combined tutorial-survey paper commences with preliminaries of 6G and wireless intelligence by outlining candidate 6G applications and services, presenting a taxonomy of state-of-the-art DAI models, exemplifying prominent DAI use cases, and elucidating the multifaceted ways through which GenAI enhances DAI. Subsequently, we present a tutorial on GMs by spotlighting seminal examples such as generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, flow-based GMs, diffusion-based GMs, generative transformers, large language models, autoregressive GMs, to name a few. Contrary to the prevailing belief that GenAI is a nascent trend, our exhaustive review of approximately 120 technical papers demonstrates the scope of research across core wireless research areas, including 1) physical layer design; 2) network optimization, organization, and management; 3) network traffic analytics; 4) cross-layer network security; and 5) localization & positioning. Furthermore, we outline the central role of GMs in pioneering areas of 6G network research, including semantic communications, integrated sensing and communications, THz communications, extremely large antenna arrays, near-field communications, digital twins, AI-generated content services, mobile edge computing and edge AI, adversarial ML, and trustworthy AI. Lastly, we shed light on the multifarious challenges ahead, suggesting potential strategies and promising remedies. Given its depth and breadth, we are confident that this tutorial-cum-survey will serve as a pivotal reference for researchers and professionals delving into this dynamic and promising domain.

AB  - The steelmaking industry is one of the most energy-intensive industries and is responsible for 4% of the world’s total greenhouse gas emissions. Solutions to improve operational efficiency can therefore bring major improvements to the overall environmental performance of the entire industry. This article proposes a novel steel quality prediction system based on gradient boosting trees that can be used to predict the quality of steel products during manufacturing. The prediction system enables the detection of possible surface defects in the early phase of the manufacturing process, thus avoiding costly and time-consuming manufacturing efforts to address defective products. In this study, we trained a prediction model with data collected from an SSAB Europe steelmaking plant in Raahe, Finland. From the 296 process parameters measured in the liquid steel stage of steelmaking, we selected 89 input features to train and test the prediction model. The model was then integrated into a quality monitoring tool (QMT) to utilize real-time manufacturing data in its predictions. The validation process showed that the prediction model can find more than 50% of defective steel products by marking only about 10% of the steel products as potentially at risk of surface defects in plate rolling. This can potentially save time in the quality control phase and improve process efficiency. To gain more insights into the model predictions, we used SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to find a potential connection between the process input parameters and surface defects.

AB  - The approximation and emulation of first principles based deterministic models are important problems in many disciplines, like physical and natural sciences, as well as in engineering (industrial design, creation of digital twins and other tasks). Typically they involve complex systems, described by partial differential or integral equations which must be solved for a variety of space and time boundary conditions. Finding these solutions is usually costly in terms of both computational resources and time. Surrogate models are an effective way of building approximations that may replace the use of the compled/costly original models, expediting and speeding operations. Computational intelligence techniques have proven suitable for surrogating purposes and this paper explores the characterization of a relatively simple deterministic system described by a partial differential equation, using white as well as black box approaches for direct supervised mappings (inverse mappings are explored elsewhere). In addition, unsupervised methods are used for gaining insight into the properties of the input and output state spaces. White-box ML techniques exposed the nature of the inter-dependencies and the importance of the predictor variables. Individually, support vector regression outperformed all other models for the fixed-location, fixed time and also for the fixedlocation, time dependent scenario. However, performance-wise, the ensemble composed of white-box techniques outperformed the one integrated by black-box methods from the point of view of error and correlation measures.

AB  - Vertical federated learning has a great potential of driving a great variety of business cooperation among enterprises in many fields. In machine learning, decision tree ensembles such as gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT) and random forest are widely applied powerful models with high interpretability and modeling efficiency. However, state-of-art framework for decision tree ensembles in vertical federated learning frameworks adapt anonymous features to avoid possible data breaches, makes the interpretability of the model compromised.To address this issue in the inference process, in this paper, we firstly make a problem analysis about the necessity of disclosure meanings of feature to Guest Party in vertical federated learning. We protect data privacy and allow the disclosure of feature meaning by concealing decision paths and adapt a communication-efficient secure computation method for inference outputs. The advantages of Fed-EINI will be demonstrated through both theoretical analysis and extensive numerical results. We improve the interpretability of the model by disclosing the meaning of features while ensuring efficiency and accuracy.

AB  - Personal thermal comfort affects occupants' health, well-being, and productivity. Its satisfaction is subjective, based on individual characteristics and dynamic environments, and challenging to understand, requiring predicted outcomes and explanations of how and why the outcomes happen. This research fulfills this concern using a personal thermal comfort model based on causal artificial intelligence. It encodes personal thermal comfort satisfaction based on a new causal-and-effect framework to connect the human mind and environmental factors. Random variables encode relevant factors, and the structural causal model performs cause-and-effect relationships. The do-calculus (e.g., d-separated and d-connected) draws the common sense of the model based on causal structure representation, contributing to a human-intelligent understanding. A directed acyclic graph and exact-inference-based variable elimination quantify the model parameters based on real-world observational data. The strength of causal relationships is verified based on causal odd ratio, causal sensitivity, and causal impact. The results highlight that our proposed model can encode physiological and physical factors to predict and explain personal thermal comfort satisfaction. It can predict and explain such satisfaction reasonably and robustly, converging to human-like interpretation. It can be applied to intelligent systems to understand personal thermal comfort.

AB  - Multivariate time series have had many applications in areas from healthcare and finance to meteorology and life sciences. Although deep neural networks have shown excellent predictive performance for time series, they have been criticised for being non-interpretable. Neural Additive Models, however, are known to be fully-interpretable by construction, but may achieve far lower predictive performance than deep networks when applied to time series. This paper introduces FocusLearn, a fully-interpretable modular neural network capable of matching or surpassing the predictive performance of deep networks trained on multivariate time series. In FocusLearn, a recurrent neural network learns the temporal dependencies in the data, while a multi-headed attention layer learns to weight selected features while also suppressing redundant features. Modular neural networks are then trained in parallel and independently, one for each selected feature. This modular approach allows the user to inspect how features influence outcomes in the exact same way as with additive models. Experimental results show that this new approach outperforms additive models in both regression and classification of time series tasks, achieving predictive performance that is comparable to state-of-the-art, non-interpretable deep networks applied to time series.

These improvements may revolutionize the practice of risk assessment so that lending decisions may be informed, regulatory oversight improved, and investor protection enhanced. An optimized model may also support thee early warning system that will provide for timely intervention to perhaps reduce the devastating impacts of corporate bankruptcies on the economy at large. It discusses the delicate trade-off between the complexity of the deployed models as well as their interpretability, emphasizing the importance of transparency in financial decision-making. It aims to develop an interpretative model that achieves high performance while maintaining comprehensibility by eliminating irrelevant features. Given the rise of the need for explainable AI in the financial sector, where explainability is vital for building trust in AI systems and aligning with regulations, this proposed approach is well-aligned with current requirement.

AB  - This article studies the challenges of multi-agent traffic control systems with a specific focus on the feasibility of communication protocols. We present an innovative approach for optimizing communication in large-scale traffic control systems. In the context of ramp metering coordination, we design and analyze the proposed communication protocols. The first protocol operates without explicit semantic interpretation, providing a baseline for performance. The second builds on the concept of advantageous directions, integrating semantic meaning into communication for enhanced explainability. Comparative results show that our proposed system outperforms the ALINEA algorithm under both protocols. Despite the slightly superior performance of the non-semantic protocol, the advantageous direction protocol yields more interpretable and meaningful results, thereby underscoring the crucial role of explainability in deep learning models. Our approach offers novel insights for the development of interpretable machine learning-based traffic control algorithms. The broader implication of this study emphasizes the importance of addressing communication feasibility in large-scale traffic control systems, illuminating the path toward more efficient, scalable traffic control solutions.

AB  - Crack segmentation is a crucial task in various domains, particularly in infrastructure inspection, civil engineering, and road maintenance. To accurately detect various cracks from the input RGB images, two artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have been presented for segmentation purpose: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and transformer-based techniques (ViT). In this study, we present a comparative analysis to evaluate the robustness of convolutional networks against ViT. CNNs are built upon a series of convolutional and pooling layers, designed to capture local patterns and features in an image. On the other hand, ViTs utilize self-attention mechanisms to capture global relationships within a sequence of input patches from the image. In addition to quantitative evaluation comparison, qualitative visual explainable heat saliency maps are derived. We use two crack datasets for comparison evaluation purposes: Crack500 and DeepCrack. We compare the evaluation results among six XAI models (three models for each; CNN and ViT). The segmentation results show the commutative measurements among the CNN and ViT models. Such a comprehensive comparison study could be helpful to assist the researchers in the domain for the best model selection.

AB  - Prognosis strategies have emerged as one of the most popular topics of the reliable framework, enhanced by deep learning in recent years. To address the dilemma of lacking a reliable and explainable deep learning approach for the health monitoring of power devices, we explored the physics-informed deep learning architecture for the health estimation of IGBT, together with an explainable feature weighting mechanism. Combining with the self-attention mechanism, we proposed the physics-informed self-attention (PISA) to assess 4 IGBT’s health state in the case of separating them into training and validation datasets. The result of the experiment has indicated the advances in the effectiveness of the proposed method, which presented a strong generalization capability on the validation data. Furthermore, as the visualization of the internal parameters of the proposed method presented, the capability of self-adapting to the representative features for the health state could be proved by applying the proposed method.

AB  - Lattice regression-based models are highly-constrainable and interpretable machine learning models used in applications such as query classification and path length prediction for maps. To improve their performance and better serve these models to millions of consumers, we accelerate them using field programmable gate arrays. We adopt a library-based approach using a high level hardware description language (HLHDL) to support the broad family of lattice models. HLHDLs improve productivity by providing both control abstraction such as looping, reductions, and memory hierarchies, as well as automatically handling low-level tasks such as retiming. However, these abstractions can lead to performance bottlenecks if not carefully used. We characterize these bottlenecks and implement a lattice regression library using a streaming tensor abstraction which avoids them. On a pair of models trained for network anomaly detection, we achieve a ${166\,-\,256\times}$ speedup over CPUs even with large batch sizes.

AB  - Sparse Tsetlin Machines (STMs) open up for assigning a small sample of the literals to each clause, and then permanently pruning those literals during learning through absorbing automata states. By trimming the STM in this manner, one can achieve a tenfold speed increase. However, when each clause is limited to the literal sample selected during clause creation, accuracy can drop. To reduce accuracy loss, we here introduce a scheme for streaming unallocated literals through the clauses. That is, the literals left out during clause construction are gradually integrated into the appropriate clauses throughout learning. That is, the literals left out during clause construction are gradually integrated into the appropriate clauses throughout learning. Each time an absorbing state eliminates a literal from a clause, a new unallocated one is added to that clause, placed in an insertion state. We study the effectiveness of the scheme at various degrees of sampling, varying the absorbing and insertion states. In particular, we investigate the effect of incorporating unallocated literal during learning. Across several benchmark datasets, we observe a boost in accuracy with sampling rates 5% and 20%. However, without literal streaming, the accuracy drops markedly for sampling rates 1 % to 4%, which confirms the positive effect literal streaming has on STMs. In conclusion, literal streaming makes the Tsetlin Machine more scalable, yielding higher accuracy with fewer resources.

AB  - Deep neural network has achieved remarkable success in fields such as image classification and object detection, sometimes even outperforming humans, but the black-box nature of deep neural networks limits their application in areas where the reasons for decisions need to be known. The increasing demand for more transparent and reliable models has led to the emergence of explainable machine learning, and more and more researchers have turned their attention to the interpretability of deep neural networks in an attempt to explore the inference process of the model by investigating the black-box properties of the network. Based on the different stages of explanation generation, we can broadly classify interpretable neural networks into two categories: post-hoc interpretable models and intrinsically interpretable models. In recent years, there have been numerous researches on interpretable neural networks, but nevertheless, there is still a lack of a unified classification and summary of the construction of intrinsically interpretable networks. In this paper, we review several typical approaches to building intrinsically interpretable neural networks in the field of image classification that have proposed in recent years, classify them according to the way they achieve interpretability, and summarize the strengths and weaknesses of each type of approach. Furthermore, we provide an outlook on future developments in this field.

AB  - Autonomous vehicles operating in dynamic environments are required to account for other traffic participants. By interpreting sensor information and assessing the collision risk with vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians, near-misses and accidents can be prevented. Moreover, by explaining risk factors to developers and engineers the overall safety of autonomous driving can be increased in future deployments. In this paper, we have designed, developed, and evaluated an approach for predicting the collision risk with other road users based on a planar 2D collision model. To this end, we have trained interpretable machine learning models to classify and predict the risk of collisions on a range of features extracted from sensor data. Further, we present methods for inferring and explaining the factors mostly contributing to the risk. Using counterfactual inference, our approach allows us to determine the factors which highly influence the risk and should in turn be minimised. Experimental results on real-world driving data show that collision risk can be effectively predicted and explained for different time horizons as well as different types of traffic participants such as cars, cyclists and pedestrians.

AB  - Simulations are used to investigate physical systems. A digital twin goes beyond this by connecting a simulation with the physical system with the purpose of analyzing and controlling that system in real-time. In the past 5 years there has been a substantial increase in research into Simulation and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The combination of Simulation with AI presents many possible innovations. Similarly, combining AI with Simulation presents further possibilities including approaches to developing trustworthy and explainable AI methods, solutions to problems arising from sparce or no data and better methods for time series analysis. Given the progress that has been made in Digital Twins and Simulation and AI, what opportunities are there from combining these two exciting research areas? What challenges need to be overcome to achieve these? This article discusses these from the perspectives of six leading members of the Modeling & Simulation community.

AB  - Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for handling graph-structured data. However, their design often limits them to learning only higher-order feature interactions, leaving low-order feature interactions overlooked. To address this problem, we introduce a novel GNN method called explicit feature interaction-aware graph neural network (EFI-GNN). Unlike conventional GNNs, EFI-GNN is a multilayer linear network designed to model arbitrary-order feature interactions explicitly within graphs. To validate the efficacy of EFI-GNN, we conduct experiments using various datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that EFI-GNN has competitive performance with existing GNNs, and when a GNN is jointly trained with EFI-GNN, predictive performance sees an improvement. Furthermore, the predictions made by EFI-GNN are interpretable, owing to its linear construction. The source code of EFI-GNN is available at https://github.com/gim4855744/EFI-GNN.

AB  - The Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) is an interpretable neural network that leverages high-level concepts to explain model decisions and conduct human-machine interaction. However, in real-world scenarios, the deficiency of informative concepts can impede the model's interpretability and subsequent interventions. This paper proves that insufficient concept information can lead to an inherent dilemma of concept and label distortions in CBM. To address this challenge, we propose the Decoupling Concept Bottleneck Model (DCBM), which comprises two phases: 1) DCBM for prediction and interpretation, which decouples heterogeneous information into explicit and implicit concepts while maintaining high label and concept accuracy, and 2) DCBM for human-machine interaction, which automatically corrects labels and traces wrong concepts via mutual information estimation. The construction of the interaction system can be formulated as a light min-max optimization problem. Extensive experiments expose the success of alleviating concept/label distortions, especially when concepts are insufficient. In particular, we propose the Concept Contribution Score (CCS) to quantify the interpretability of DCBM. Numerical results demonstrate that CCS can be guaranteed by the Jensen-Shannon divergence constraint in DCBM. Moreover, DCBM expresses two effective human-machine interactions, including forward intervention and backward rectification, to further promote concept/label accuracy via interaction with human experts.

AB  - Droughts typically develop gradually, and early prediction is crucial for the government to formulate effective mitigation plans. Our approach does not involve predicting specific drought index values. Instead, we forecast whether a particular year will experience drought. Insufficient investigation has been carried out regarding variations in additional climatic indicators like shortwave radiation, wind speed, sea level, and pollution in the context of droughts in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. In the study period taken from 1995 to 2020, only three years (2002, 2009, and 2017) experienced drought occurrences, resulting in an imbalanced dataset. To enhance the classification performance of this imbalanced dataset, a weighted dataset is constructed using a feature weighting approach known as the Single Objective Scorer (SOS) based Multi-objective PSO(MPSO) in conjunction with the Gradient Boosting Classifier. The proposed model facilitates objective-based multi-population formation and neighborhood learning. Precision and recall are crucial metrics, particularly in measuring imbalanced dataset classification performance. The application of multi-objective optimization techniques helps to strike a suitable balance between precision and recall. In addition to the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), 14 climatic indicators based on land, atmosphere, and sea are utilized. By employing the weighted dataset created with SOS-based MPSO, a significant improvement in recall value of 0.81 is achieved. Based on the weights assigned to the features, it is identified that the Mean Sea Level of the Arabian Sea and CO2 are significant indicators for predicting meteorological drought. The Explainable AI techniques SHAP and LIME are employed for interpreting the drought prediction model, providing insights into its workings.

AB  - With the rapid advancement of Internet technology, the threat of malware to computer systems and network security has intensified. Malware affects individual privacy and security and poses risks to critical infrastructures of enterprises and nations. The increasing quantity and complexity of malware, along with its concealment and diversity, challenge traditional detection techniques. Static detection methods struggle against variants and packed malware, while dynamic methods face high costs and risks that limit their application. Consequently, there is an urgent need for novel and efficient malware detection techniques to improve accuracy and robustness.This study first employs the minhash algorithm to convert binary files of malware into grayscale images, followed by the extraction of global and local texture features using GIST and LBP algorithms. Additionally, the study utilizes IDA Pro to decompile and extract opcode sequences, applying N-gram and tf-idf algorithms for feature vectorization. The fusion of these features enables the model to comprehensively capture the behavioral characteristics of malware.In terms of model construction, a CNN-BiLSTM fusion model is designed to simultaneously process image features and opcode sequences, enhancing classification performance. Experimental validation on multiple public datasets demonstrates that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional detection techniques in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1 score, particularly in detecting variants and obfuscated malware with greater stability.The research presented in this paper offers new insights into the development of malware detection technologies, validating the effectiveness of feature and model fusion, and holds promising application prospects.

AB  - Due to the advanced growth in multimedia data and Cloud Computing (CC), Secure Image Archival and Retrieval System (SIARS) on cloud has gained more interest in recent times. Content based image retrieval (CBIR) systems generally retrieve the images relevant to the query image (QI) from massive databases. However, the secure image retrieval process is needed to ensure data confidentiality and secure data transmission between cloud storage and users. Existing secure image retrieval models faces difficulties like minimum retrieval performance, which fails to adapt with the large-scale IR in cloud platform. To resolve this issue, this article presents a SIARS using deep learning (DL) and multiple share creation schemes. The proposed SIARS model involves Adagrad based convolutional neural network (AG-CNN) based feature extractor to extract the useful set of features from the input images. At the same time, secure multiple share creation (SMSC) schemes are executed to generate multiple shares of the input images. The resultant shares and the feature vectors are stored in the cloud database with the respective image identification number. Upon retrieval, the user provides a query image and reconstructs the received shared image to attain the related images from the database. An elaborate experimentation analysis is carried out on benchmark Corel10K dataset and the results are examined in terms of retrieval efficiency and image quality. The attained results ensured the superior performance of the SIARS model on all the applied test images.

AB  - Image transmission over Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LP-WAN) protocols has always been a difficult task since it necessitates high data rates and high energy consumption. Long Range (LoRa) is one such protocol, which is excellent for transferring data over long distances but has generated severe doubts regarding the viability of image transmission due to its low data rate. This paper demonstrates the application results of an integrated LoRa and Deep Learning-based computer vision system that can efficiently identify grape leaf diseases using low-resolution images. In particular, the focus in this paper is to combine the two technologies, LoRa and Deep Learning, to make the transmission of the images and the identification of the diseases possible. To achieve this objective, the framework utilizes a combination of on-site and simulation experiments along with different LoRa parameters and Convolutional Neural Model (CNN) model fine-tuning. Based on the evaluation, the proposed framework proved that the transmission of images using LoRa is possible within the protocol limitations (such as limited bandwidth and low duty cycle). Our fine-tuned model can efficiently identify grape leaves diseases. The technique is both efficient and adaptive to the specifics of each leaf disease, while it does not need any training data to adjust parameters. It is worth noting that today, end-user trust in Machine and Deep Learning models has increased significantly because of novel solutions in the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). In this study, we use the Grad-CAM method to visualize the output layer judgments of the CNN. The disease’s spot region is highly activated, according to the visualization findings. This is how the network distinguishes between different grape leaf diseases.

Secure transmission and management of medical images are essential to enable collaboration while protecting sensitive patient information. This study analyzes various methods for safe medical data sharing, highlighting their advantages and limitations We categorize these approaches into centralized techniques, such as encryption and watermarking, and distributed methods, such as blockchain and federated learning. Additionally, this research examines the evolution of medical image watermarking techniques, from traditional methods to advanced AI-based systems. While traditional techniques known as white boxes are simple and interpretable, deep learning models are considered black boxes, offering greater robustness and adaptability. This analysis emphasizes the need to integrate modern technology to address the growing complexity of threats, while preserving the diagnostic integrity of medical images. Furthermore, our work provides a comprehensive classification of watermarking methods and outlines future research directions, contributing to the ongoing discourse on enhancing data security in medical imaging

AB  - Advancements in large language models (LLMs) have massively transformed user interactions with AI by enabling the creation of systems that exhibit human-like capabilities, particularly in natural language processing and understanding, allowing for more natural and intuitive human-computer interactions. While the transformative potential of LLMs is undeniable, these powerful models also come with potential risks of generating biased, inappropriate and harmful responses, which needs to be mitigated; and in this process of risk management of LLMs, a very critical step is the detection of these risks.The existing models for toxicity and bias detection, primarily been trained on datasets sourced from social media or similar public platforms, have significant performance gaps when applied to real-world user-AI interactions [1]. To address these gaps, we have introduced a multi-task T5-based model [2] specifically designed for simultaneously detecting toxicity and bias within conversational AI. Our approach involved an iterative, three-stage methodology, which involves synthetic training dataset creation, balancing the dataset through strategic downsampling of dominant categories and upsampling of minority categories, and iterative model training mechanism to accommodate computational limitations. Our research emphasizes a data-centric fine-tuning approach, the importance of carefully curated, balanced training datasets, iterative model refinement, and comprehensive evaluation methodologies. Evaluation on benchmark datasets demonstrated our model’s superior performance, exceeding Claude V2 [3] and achieving comparable accuracy to GPT 4 [4] and superior accuracy to GPT-3.5 [5] in a typical setting of LLM-as-a-judge based evaluation in Phoenix evaluation framework [6]. Our work provides a foundational framework towards building safer, ethically aligned and explainable conversational AI systems.
