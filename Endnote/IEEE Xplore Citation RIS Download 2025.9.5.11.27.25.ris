AB  - This study introduces two novel explainable AI frameworks, Interclass-Grad-CAM and Spectral-Grad-CAM, designed to enhance the interpretability of semantic segmentation models for Crop and Land Cover Land Use (CLCLU) mapping. Interclass-Grad-CAM provides insights into interactions between land cover classes, revealing complex spatial arrangements, while Spectral-Grad-CAM quantifies the contributions of individual spectral bands to model predictions, optimizing spectral data use. These XAI methods significantly advance understanding of model behavior, particularly in heterogeneous landscapes, and ensure enhanced transparency in CLCLU mapping. To demonstrate the effectiveness of these innovations, we developed a framework that addresses data asymmetry between the United States and Mexico in the transboundary Middle Rio Grande region. Our approach integrates pixel-level multisensor fusion, combining dual-month moderate-resolution optical imagery (July and December 2023), synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and digital elevation model (DEM) data, processed using a Multi-Attention Network with a modified Mix Vision Transformer encoder to process multiple spectral inputs. Results indicate a uniform improvement in class-specific Intersection over Union by approximately 1% with multisensor integration compared to optical imagery alone. Optical bands proved most effective for crop classification, while SAR and DEM data enhanced predictions for nonagricultural types. This framework not only improves CLCLU mapping accuracy, but also offers a robust tool for broader environmental monitoring and resource management applications.

AB  - The increasing complexity of supply chain finance poses significant challenges to effective credit risk assessment. Traditional black-box models often fail to provide insights into the factors driving credit risk, which is essential for stakeholders when making informed decisions. By conducting analysis of interpretable machine learning models, the study evaluated their performance in assessing credit risks. Specifically, we applied Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF), Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for risk assessment. Our methodology included an ablation experiment along with utilizing Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) to elucidate the contribution and significance of specific risk factors. The results indicated that the asset-liability ratio, cash ratio, and quick ratio notably influence credit risk. This study clarified the applicability and limitations of various models, highlighting the superior performance and interpretability of XGBoost through the SHAP algorithm. Ultimately, the insights from this study provided valuable guidance for companies and financial institutions, fostering more sustainable allocation of financial resources.

AB  - In industries, machines communicate through sounds, decoded by predictive maintenance to prevent issues. Understanding motor sounds is crucial for seamless industrial operations. This research undertakes a comprehensive explo-ration of machine learning models, specifically Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Random Forest, applied to motor sound data for classifying instances as either healthy or faulty. The ANN, boasting an 81.22 % accuracy, reveals commendable precision and recall values for both classes, indicating its robust predictive capabilities. However, there is room for improvement, particu-larly in accurately classifying healthy motors. SVM marginally outperforms the ANN with an accuracy of 81.32%, showcasing balanced precision and recall for both classes. Notably, KNN, while exhibiting a slightly lower accuracy of 80.22 %, excels in recall for the healthy class, emphasizing its efficacy in correctly identifying healthy motor sounds. Random Forest attains an accuracy of 81.32 %, featuring notably high recall for the healthy class (0.91), underscoring its proficiency in capturing instances of healthy motor sounds. In-depth metrics provide nuanced insights into the strengths and specificities of each model, offering a foundation for informed decisions based on application priorities and requirements. The study contributes not only quantitative metrics but also interpretability tools, including LIME and SHAP, to enhance transparency and elucidate the intricate patterns within motor sound data.

AB  - Forests and forest ecosystems are vital to our social, economic, and environmental well-being. However, climate change and climate-driven disturbances (CDDs) are undermining the health and resilience of forests worldwide and pose significant uncertainty to sustainable forest management. Climate-smart forestry (CSF) remains a grand challenge in practice due to our limited knowledge of how forests respond to climate change and our abilities to collect related information to empower decision making. Rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) can offer a timely opportunity to address the challenges in CSF. We argue that the AI-enabled, next-generation CSF can be achievable through synergistically coordinated and transdisciplinary efforts that develop and advance foundational and use-inspired AI technologies that can lead to building next-generation forest decision support systems.

AB  - Rip currents have long posed a serious threat to beachgoers and swimmers. Despite numerous preventive measures throughout the period, the fatality rate [1] underscores the need for a robust rip current detection system. Recently deep learning models have shown promising results in rip current detection, outperforming traditional methods. However, these models still exhibit some accuracy limitations due to insufficient data distribution. To address this challenge, we incorporate a novel largest dataset [2] comprising over 110,215 Korean coastline images. Through the comparative study of the state-of-the-art models, we aim to analyze the detection accuracy of each model and gain a deeper understanding of their intensity over rip current detection. In comparison to the other rip current datasets, the evaluation results on our proposed dataset demonstrate a remarkable elevation in accuracy, reaching 79.4 mAP. Further, we employ the EigenCAM (Eigen Class Activation Maps) to interpret the intense regions of the rip currents and to gain a deeper comprehension of rip current explainability. This comprehensive analysis marks a significant step toward improving rip current safety and understanding.

AB  - Vertical farming is revolutionizing agriculture by enabling the cultivation of crops in controlled environments, optimizing space usage, and reducing the need for traditional farming resources. However, the artificial conditions in vertical farms can induce stress in plants, affecting their growth and productivity. This paper presents a novel approach to detecting canopy stress in vertical farming using explainable AI techniques. The proposed method leverages deep learning models, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to analyze images captured by cameras and sensors within the vertical farm. By employing Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping), the model provides visual explanations for its predictions, enhancing transparency and trust in the AI system. The study utilizes the Agricola Moderna Healthy-Stress Dataset (AGMHS), comprising high-resolution RGB images of crops, to train and validate the model. The methodology includes pre-processing steps such as image resizing, noise removal, and contrast enhancement, followed by feature extraction using ResNet50 and dimensionality reduction with PCA. The classification of stress conditions is performed using CNNs, and the results are interpreted using Grad-CAM to highlight the critical regions influencing the model’s decisions. The proposed approach demonstrates high accuracy in detecting stress conditions, outperforming existing methods. The integration of explainable AI techniques ensures that stakeholders, including farmers and researchers, can understand and trust the model’s predictions, ultimately contributing to more efficient and sustainable vertical farming practices.

AB  - Modern vehicles are complex Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) that operate across diverse environments, where the failure of critical subsystems such as the engine, transmission, brakes, and fuel system can lead to unplanned downtime and significant maintenance costs. To mitigate these challenges, continuous health monitoring and early detection of abnormal sensor behavior are essential. Data-driven Digital Twin (DT) systems offer a promising solution to this problem by leveraging sensor data to model and predict the state of vehicle subsystems. However, existing DT solutions primarily rely on Deep Learning (DL) techniques, which often function as black-box models, providing little to no insight into their decision-making processes. This lack of explainability hinders trust and informed decision-making among automotive stakeholders. To address this challenge, this paper presents TwinExplainer, a novel three-layered architectural pipeline designed to explain the predictions made by deep learning algorithms in data-driven DT. TwinExplainer provides visual explanations through graphs and complements them with linguistic explanations generated by Large Language Models (LLM), offering stakeholders intuitive insights into feature contributions and model behavior at both local and global levels.

The development of deep learning (DL) is making machines smarter in their potential to comprehend and react to complicated human behavior and more human-like and adaptable behavior.We critically analyze the use of DL for cognitive HCI in depth. Our survey overviewed the key DL models (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, GANs) and applications such as emotion detection, brain-computer interfaces (BCI), gesture and gaze, speech, and adaptive user interfaces. We also mention current state-of-the-art techniques and their strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, we present barriers to usage, such as, but not limited to, real-time performance, data scarcity, interpretability, and ethical considerations. Also, we elaborate on applied research directions to undertake, such as, but not limited to, cognitive digital twins, human-centric explainable AI, and edge AI for real-time interfaces. Our goal in this survey is to educate researchers and practitioners regarding AI and cognitive HCI through an overview of the state-of-the-art nowadays and possible future directions for the development of systems that are more interactional and human-like.

AB  - An essential component of the educational activity is rigorous examination and assessment of students' results, with a potential substantial influence on student growth. This paper offers a predictional model for student's success in secondary education using five classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, and Naive Bayes, where the data is gathered from two Portuguese school reports and surveys. The two core disciplines (Mathematics subject and Portuguese language) of the dataset were modeled around binary/five-level classification tasks which is imbalanced. The imbalanced dataset is also balanced by using K-Means SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) before classification. The test results reveal that obtaining the most outstanding accuracy value is 96.89% of Support Vector Machine (SVM) is superior to Logistic Regression, KNN, XG-Boost, and Naive Bayes. Therefore, it is essential to consider whether a model makes a particular prediction. Thus, we then train an interpretable LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) model for all the classifiers and the construction of explainable models can have a major advantage: the model can be confident, the transparency of the model helps to understand the underlying processes for working.

AB  - The attempt to concretely define the concept of explainability in terms of other vaguely described notions, is doomed to fail. We argue that a rigorous numeric measure is needed to take a significant step forward. Such a measure would allow the objective comparison of machine learning models that are explainable to varying degrees. In the longer term, a numeric measure might make it possible to compare humans and machines in terms of explanatory capacities, thereby establishing a very specific kind of Turing test.We introduce some notions and rigorous definitions related to explainability, in particular completeness and consistency. The objective of this paper is that the introduced terms can act as a concrete starting point for the construction of a mathematically expressed measure of explainability. We also show how the idea of model selection, where a model is chosen from a candidate set by optimizing the trade-off between complexity and goodness of fit, can be applied to select explainable models.

AB  - Disaster management is a significant worldwide concern that needs precise, real-time predictive models to successfully limit hazards. Conventional methods are ineffective for processing dynamic, high-dimensional disaster data, leading to delayed responses and heightened fatalities. This paper presents H-PReADS (Hybrid forecast Analytics for Disaster Surveillance), an AI-based system utilising LSTM, CNN, XGBoost, and IoT-enabled real-time monitoring to improve forecast accuracy and disaster readiness. The model surpasses traditional methods, with 98.5% accuracy, 97.2% precision, 96.8% recall, and a 0.99 ROC-AUC score, indicating enhanced robustness. compared to current systems, H-PReADS integrates multi-source sensor data, guaranteeing real-time adaptability and superior generalisation capability. Significant contributions encompass hybrid AI architecture, real-time sensor integration, and the development of ethical AI. These findings position HPReADS as an innovative method for proactive disaster response. Future research will investigate blockchain-secured data interchange and federated learning-based distributed intelligence to improve scalability and security.

AB  - Cast-resin transformers are affected by deterioration due to manufacturing defects and continuous load. Studying PD, which is capable of detecting defects or degradation in advance, is important. With the rapid advancement of AI technologies, research on PD classification using CNN models is being actively conducted. However, due to the black box problem, it is impossible to explain the reasoning behind the learning outcomes. Therefore, relying solely on predictive outcomes of learning for PD classification raises issues of reliability. Recent studies in various fields are progressing with the application of XAI to address the black box issue of CNNs, aiming to identify the criteria used for making predictions. However, research on applying XAI in AI-based PD classification is currently insufficient. Therefore, further study on the implementation of XAI is necessary. In this paper, an excellent CNN model was applied to image classification for PD classification of cast-resin transformers, and the grad-cam model was used for XAI. This approach proposes a method for humans to comprehend the rationale behind the learning outcomes. The training data includes artificial defects created in laboratory settings and noise captured in cast-resin transformers using UHF sensors. Our research demonstrated that PD and noise due to defects can be identified with an accuracy of approximately 97%. The reasons for successful and failed results were analyzed through XAI. Consequently, it was observed that the application of XAI to CNN models leads to the construction of a more reliable model.

AB  - Weather-related failures significantly challenge the reliability of distribution systems. To enhance the risk management of weather-related failures, an interpretable extra-trees based weather-related risk prediction model is proposed in this study. In the proposed model, the interpretability is successfully introduced to extra-trees by analyzing and processing the paths of decision trees in extra-trees. As a result, the interpretability of the proposed model is reflected in the following three respects: it can output the importance, contribution, and threshold of weather variables at high risk. The importance of weather variables can help in developing a long-term risk prevention plan. The contribution of weather variables provides targeted operation and maintenance advice for the next prediction period. The threshold of weather variables at high risk is critical in further preventing high risks. Compared with the black-box machine learning risk prediction models, the proposed model over-comes the application limitations. In addition to generating predicted risk levels, it can also provide more guidance information for the risk management of weather-related failures.

AB  - The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into quality control (QC) has revolutionized data validation and anomaly detection, enabling automation at scale. However, existing AI-driven QC frameworks often fail to meet operational expectations due to limitations in interpretability, scalability, and false alarm management. In this study, we propose a structured multi-layer framework that addresses these challenges and facilitates the implementation of AI-based QC in large-scale data production. Developed from our experience transitioning the Morningstar Total Return Index (TRI) QC process to an AI-driven approach, the framework improves reliability through scalable data processing, governance, real-time anomaly detection, and intelligent false detection management. By structuring AI-based QC into distinct layers, our framework improves trustworthiness, reduces false positives, and ensures compliance with industry regulations. Validated using Morningstar’s TRI, it demonstrates practical benefits in financial data environments. Through expert feedback integration, dependency-aware anomaly detection, and customizable alerting, the system enhances anomaly detection while minimizing false alarms, making AI-driven QC more adaptive and effective in ensuring data reliability.

AB  - In this research, we have explored the complex field of credit risk prediction using a various approach that integrates machine learning model for classification and model explainability. Accurate risk assessment, model performance evaluation, and open communication of predictions to stakeholders are the main goals. The project begins with descriptive statistics and exploratory data analysis (EDA), which reveals information on the financial and demographic makeup of credit applicants. Afterwards, outlier identification and elimination through Tukey's method and IsolationForest are done separately to guarantee the validity of ensuing analyses. Our predictive modelling is based on the use of many techniques, including random forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, logistic regression and finally ensemble model. Every model is fine-tuned for peak performance, and a comparative analysis provides a standard for forecast accuracy. We use methods such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to improve the interpretability of our models. With the use of these techniques, we can better understand and convey the judgments rendered by intricate models, promoting openness in the evaluation of credit risk.

AB  - The digital experience emerging in the virtual world is a reality with the advent of the metaverse. Augmented reality(AR), virtual reality(VR), extended reality(XR), and artificial intelligence(AI) algorithms would pave the way for an immersive experience for the users in the virtual space. However, the explosion of these technologies broaches new challenges to threaten the success of metaverse due to security risks. The blockchain technology augmented with AI promises to deliver a trusted metaverse for everyone. Nevertheless, smart contracts fail to produce a cognitive prediction, dissuading users from confiding in the metaverse. We arm smart contracts with intelligence to predict using AI algorithms. Moreover, we deploy the smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain platform and produce a prediction accuracy of 95% compared to Python scikit-learn-based predictions. Our results show that the prediction delay can obstruct the growth of metaverse applications to accept blockchain technologies. Furthermore, the limitation of blockchain technology can make integration unreasonable. Therefore, we discuss possible scalability solutions that can be part of our future work to help more metaverse applications adopt blockchain solutions.

AB  - This study proposes an innovative solution for credit card fraud detection, utilizing a stacking ensemble of machine learning classifiers enhanced with sophisticated data resampling techniques. The model demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving an F1-score of 0.92, precision of 0.95, recall of 0.88, an AUPRC of 0.96, and a perfect ROC-AUC of 1.00. These results significantly outperform standalone models like XGBoost and Decision Tree, showcasing the strength of the proposed approach. The study addresses two critical challenges, class imbalance and overfitting, by employing K-means SMOTEENN to balance minority class representation while reducing synthetic data noise, thus lowering the risk of overfitting. Additionally, the stacking ensemble’s integration of diverse classifiers produces a generalized decision boundary, enhancing model robustness in real-world scenarios. This ensures a precise fraud detection mechanism without compromising sensitivity. Furthermore, the proposed model incorporates Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to enhance interpretability and trust. The study identifies key features driving model predictions by leveraging Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), illustrating how base learners and the meta-learner contribute to the final decision. This transparency bolsters stakeholder confidence and provides actionable insights for financial institutions. Overall, the proposed approach marks a notable step in protecting financial transactions from fraud.

The cognitive engine is in charge of implementing the functionality of a cognitive system. Nowadays, cognitive engines are used as a self-organized management mechanism in different fields such as computer networks, Internet of Things (IoT), and Robotics. This is because the management algorithms of these fields are going to be very complex and therefore human thinking models as digitalized models are required for fast and accurate decision making. In this paper, we summarize challenges in designing cognitive engines. Then, a set of challenges in designing the cognitive engine for body-mind operating system in the digitalized healthcare system is obtained.

This systematization of knowledge paper provides a comprehensive overview of AP systems, analyzing their current state, identifying critical vulnerabilities across software, hardware, and communication components, and exploring the dual role of artificial intelligence (AI). We show that while AI techniques, such as reinforcement learning, deep learning, and federated learning, offer promising solutions to improve security, performance, and personalization, they also introduce new attack vectors, including adversarial attacks on control algorithms and AI-enhanced exploitation of existing vulnerabilities. This paper systematically categorizes known and potential attacks, synthesizes current research on AI-driven threats and defenses, and identifies critical research gaps that must be addressed to ensure patient safety. We highlight the urgent need for robust, explainable AI, multi-layered security approaches, and proactive collaboration between researchers, clinicians, manufacturers, and regulatory bodies to realize the full potential of secure and intelligent AP systems.

AB  - Industry 5.0 is a emerging transformative model that aims to develop a hyperconnected, automated, and data-driven industrial ecosystem. This digital transformation will boost productivity and efficiency throughout the production process but will be more prone to new sophisticated cyber-attacks. Deep learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have the potential to recognize intrusions with high accuracy. However, these models are complex and are treated as a black box by developers and security analysts due to the inability to interpret the decisions made by these models. Motivated by the challenges, this paper presents an explainable and resilient IDS for Industry 5.0. The proposed IDS is designed by combining bidirectional long short-term memory networks (BiLSTM), a bidirectional-gated recurrent unit (Bi-GRU), fully connected layers and a softmax classifier to enhance the intrusion detection process in Industry 5.0. We employ the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) mechanism to interpret and understand the features that contributed the most in the decision of the proposed cyber-resilient IDS. The evaluation of the proposed model using the explainability can ensure that the model is working as expected. The experimental results based on the CICDDoS2019 dataset confirms the superiority of the proposed IDS over some recent approaches.

We address the critical shortage of authentic industrial datasets for academic research by presenting an industry-validated IIoT educational dataset derived from three months of operational data from a steel plant, enriched with domain-specific annotations. We propose a comprehensive IIoT framework specifically designed for smart steel manufacturing, integrating LLMs with IIoT infrastructure. This novel architecture unifies real-time process monitoring, predictive analytics, and adaptive learning, simulating a smart factory ecosystem. It facilitates humanmachine collaboration and replicates quality control workflows, thereby bridging the gap between educational theory and industrial practice. A key component of our framework is an interactive decision-making dashboard powered by LLMs. This AI-driven tool contextualizes IIoT data, offering dynamic visualizations of critical parameters such as metallization levels and H2/CO ratios. It further enables scenario-based simulations for energy optimization in a risk-free environment, empowering learners to experiment and understand complex industrial processes. Our study demonstrates the transformative potential of LLMs in HoT education, offering a practical and engaging learning environment that directly aligns with industrial realities.

The construction of artifacts (designs) made technology a fundamental part of life, so much so that it altered how people think and behave, hence the charge that design is in part responsible for the mess the world is in. And that mess is not just climate change: it also includes war, slavery, class domination, racism, many forms of discrimination, and colonization. The climate crisis is only one of the many results of the way the world has been designed, whether intentionally or unintentionally, consciously or not.

The construction of artifacts (designs) made technology a fundamental part of life, so much so that it altered how people think and behave, hence the charge that design is in part responsible for the mess the world is in. And that mess is not just climate change: it also includes war, slavery, class domination, racism, many forms of discrimination, and colonization. The climate crisis is only one of the many results of the way the world has been designed, whether intentionally or unintentionally, consciously or not.

AB  - In machining processes, cutting tool wear is a critical problem affecting key performance parameters such as surface quality, production time, and cost. High temperatures cause deformation and wear in the tool material and shorten tool life. This reduces production efficiency and negatively affects the sustainability of quality-oriented goals such as zerodefect manufacturing. In this review study, the current literature on the prediction of cutting tool wear in machining processes using thermal imaging and deep learning techniques is analyzed. With advancing manufacturing technologies, unattended machining capability and the proliferation of approaches such as Zero Defect Manufacturing (ZDM), realtime and accurate monitoring of cutting tool conditions is a strategic requirement for production efficiency and quality control. In this context, the possibilities offered by indirect wear detection methods based on temperature data and the applications of deep learning-based models in this field are evaluated. Significant success has been achieved in tool life prediction by processing temperature maps obtained with thermal cameras, thermocouples, and infrared (IR) imaging systems using algorithms such as CNN and ANN. The methods in the literature are discussed comparatively and their advantages and limitations are discussed. This paper systematically reviews the existing approaches in the literature for tool wear monitoring using temperature-based methods and provides a comprehensive review for future research in this area.

AB  - Coconut tree cultivation is crucial for many tropical cultures, serving as a vital source of nutrition, income, and environmental stability. However, the traditional methods used in coconut tree tissue culture are not without challenges. Issues such as bacterial and fungal infections can significantly hamper the growth and productivity of coconut trees, limiting the effectiveness of tissue culture practices. These infections often go undetected in their early stages, making it difficult for farmers to take timely and effective action. This research proposes a novel approach to improving coconut tree tissue culture by integrating machine learning with agronomical expertise. Through advanced image analysis, the study enhances the identification and severity prediction of bacterial and fungal infections in tissue cultures. These insights lead to actionable recommendations for healthier trees and more efficient cultivation. Integrating technology with traditional expertise marks a significant advancement in addressing challenges faced by coconut farmers, offering a pathway to increased productivity, sustainability, and improved infection management, benefiting both farmers and the broader agricultural community.

AB  - Artificial intelligence - Machine learning (ML) is an emergent area of AI that aims to enhance the capability of a system to make predictions or decisions based on the data fed to it without the system being specifically programmed for such functions. Its importance stems from its capacity to analyze and abstract information, predict, and even make decisions in various contexts, transforming sectors such as healthcare, finance, and technology. With the increasingly large volume of data being created, the role played by ML in processing this data to discover meaningful patterns becomes more prominent. ML algorithms can be broadly categorized into three main types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Linear regression and support vector machines, for instance, work from labeled training sets in order to make predictions and classifications. Such algorithms are used in many applications, like face recognition, filtering spam emails, and even diagnosing diseases. On the other hand, unsupervised learning operators, including K-means clustering and principal component analysis, work with data sets lacking labels to discover latent structures and patterns common in market segmentation and anomaly detection. Reinforcement learning can be viewed as enabling an agent to take a set of actions in an environment to maximize the total reward, as in Q-learning. This approach is especially useful in applications such as robotics, games, and the use of autonomous systems. In summary, machine learning algorithms are a key differentiator in improving productivity and fostering innovation, thereby facilitating advancements across various industries while creating future possibilities in artificial intelligence.

AB  - Plant diseases significantly impact agricultural productivity, making it essential to accurately assess not only the presence of disease but also its severity. This paper presents a deep learning-based framework using ResNet50 to predict plant disease severity across multiple levels (Healthy, Mild, Moderate, and Severe). The system is designed to process plant leaf images, perform augmentation to improve robustness and classify disease severity with high accuracy. The proposed method leverages labelled and pseudo- labelled datasets to enhance the model's performance through data augmentation and training on unlabelled images. The results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in distinguishing between varying levels of disease progression, providing valuable insights for early intervention and optimized crop management strategies. This platform is crucial for automating plant disease severity monitoring, and aiding decision-making processes for timely interventions in agriculture.

AB  - In the evolving cyber threat landscape, enterprises employ multiple security solutions such as Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), and Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR). Security analysts are inundated with millions of security event logs from such security tools that makes it increasingly complex to manage and analyze these huge data effectively. Further, there is unavailability of dedicated as well as skilled manpower who can understand and analyse such security events. This paper proposes a novel approach based on generative AI using the state-of-the-art Mistral-7B language model to generate clear and actionable security response messages from these event logs. We demonstrate that this cutting-edge language model can translate complex logs into human-understandable security insights which can enhance analysts’ ability to prioritize and respond to threats.

AB  - In this work, we generalize the notion of restricted equivalence function for type-2 fuzzy sets, leading to the notion of extended restricted equivalence functions. We also study how under suitable conditions, these new functions recover the standard axioms for restricted equivalence functions in the real setting. Extended restricted equivalence functions allow us to compare any two general type-2 fuzzy sets and to generate a similarity measure for type-2 fuzzy sets. The result of this similarity is a fuzzy set on the same referential set (i.e., domain) as the considered type-2 fuzzy set. The latter is crucial for applications such as explainable AI and decision-making, as it enables an intuitive interpretation of the similarity within the domain-specific context of the fuzzy sets. We show how this measure can be used to compare type-2 fuzzy sets with different membership functions in such a way that the uncertainty linked to type-2 fuzzy sets is not lost. This is achieved by generating a fuzzy set rather than a single numerical value. Furthermore, we also show how to obtain a numerical value for discrete referential sets.

Exploring its disruptive potential across the value chain—from network design to agile and robust automation—we showcase GenAI as a catalyst for innovation and unparalleled efficiency. While tracing its historical journey from conception to practical implementation, the paper positions GenAI not as the sole solution but as the inception of a new era shaping network design, deployment strategies, and synchronous optimization dynamics. We also scrutinize the role of causal AI and transparent frameworks, such as explainable AI and neuro-symbolic AI in fostering trust and seamlessly integrating domain knowledge. Looking ahead beyond GenAI, we envision a future AI landscape composed of semantic communications, collaborative GenAI and discriminative agents. We also examine the challenges related to scalability and complexity that must be overcome to achieve sustainable AI deployments. Finally, we highlight the significance of emerging computing technologies and frameworks, such as quantum and neuromorphic computing, that play a pivotal role in the broader trajectory towards artificial general intelligence.

AB  - White blood cell morphology is the most important diagnostic component in the case of leukaemia. The need for a computerized system is appropriate in all cases since the judgment is impacted by the diagnosing the individual’s pathologic experiences. Under a microscope, the morphology of blood smear slides is used to make the diagnostic. An accurate diagnosis may be achieved with the use of deep and machine learning frameworks. Although these frameworks’ accuracy levels are excellent on their own, the outcomes of the diagnosis are much better when they are combined. The field of intelligent computing and machine learning has become more and more interested in ensemble learning strategies in recent decades. The use of already trained models during model construction is also beneficial for some designated tasks related to classification. All sorts of classifications make up this massive dataset that these algorithms are trained on. As a result, these models will work for a wide variety of circumstances. Transfer learning is used to tailor pre-trained models to the given challenge. Just as important for diagnosis is the ability to distinguish between subtypes of leukaemia using actual photos sourced from a privately held database, as opposed to relying only on binary classification on pictures taken from standard datasets. The deep learning classifier are sometimes seen as mysterious entities. We are delving further into the medical arena of diagnosis, and the ability to explain and comprehension of conclusions are crucial. A more widespread use of these computerized frameworks in the business world is therefore possible. Compared to VGG-16 and Inception, the suggested Ensemble classifier obtains a $100 \%$ accuracy rate, which is much better.

AB  - Industry 4.0 derived technologies have the potential to enable a new wave of digital manufacturing solutions for semi and fully automated production. In addition, this paradigm encompasses the use of communication technologies to transmit data to processing stations as well as the utilization of cloud based computational resources for data mining. Despite the rise in automation, future manufacturing systems will initially still require humans in the loop to provide supervisory level mediation for even the most autonomous production scenarios. Through a structured review, this paper details a number of key technologies that are most likely to shape this future and describes a range of scenarios for their use in delivering human mediated automated and autonomous production. This paper argues that in all cases of future manufacturing management it is key that the human has oversight of critical information flows and remains an active participant in the delivery of the next generation of production systems.

AB  - Diagnosing brain tumors using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) presents significant challenges due to the complexities of segmentation and the variability in tumor characteristics. To address the limitations inherent in traditional methods, this research employs an advanced deep learning approach, integrating ResNet50 for feature extraction and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for data augmentation. A comprehensive evaluation of ten transfer learning algorithms, including GoogLeNet and VGG-16, was conducted for the classification of brain tumors. Model performance was assessed using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, complemented by additional metrics such as Hamming loss and the Matthews correlation coefficient to provide a more comprehensive insight. To ensure transparency in image predictions, Explainable AI techniques, specifically Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), were utilized. The study involved the analysis of 7023 MRI images, with TumorGANet being trained on a dataset encompassing gliomas, meningiomas, non-tumorous cases, and pituitary tumors. The results demonstrate the exceptional performance of proposed model named TumorGANet, achieving an accuracy of 99.53%, precision and recall rates of 100%, F1 scores of 99%, and a Hamming loss of 0.2%.

AB  - In recent years, urban centers have increasingly been equipped with sensing, storage, and computational capabilities in the form of road infrastructure and intelligent vehicles, making cities smarter. These advancements make it possible for traffic management systems to provide enhanced traffic solutions to people, thus, improving the quality of their daily life. In this paper, we focus on an AI-based, human-centered traffic management system in a smart city context, which represents a core Metaverse application. The system considers both drivers’ and traffic flow requirements in order to route vehicles safely and effectively. Our personalized route planner takes into account all relevant factors, such as the use of virtual edge servers to obtain real-time traffic data and vehicle sensing capabilities to estimate human behavior and state of alertness to achieve personalized and context-aware vehicle routing. The proposed system also aims to satisfy the demand for virtual edge computing resources in the context of smart cities and the Metaverse by re-routing vehicles based on computing resource availability at the micro clouds. One of the main challenges of the proposed system is ensuring its adoption rate in the user’s daily life. We therefore argue that, to increase the penetration rate of the proposed solution, it is essential to inform the user about the reasoning behind the decisions made by the AI-based route planning system with explainable AI strategies and emphasize how adopting such a system can improve their quality of life.

AB  - This paper studies and compares the gap selection process of multiple vehicle classes (passenger cars, delivery vans, and trucks) within their discretionary lane changing activities. Given a trajectory or a sequence of gap selection decisions, we aim to predict whether a vehicle will change or keep a lane. For this purpose, we use a large trajectory dataset, collected for the Netherlands, consisting of 3,647 trajectories of passenger car drivers, 1,080 trajectories of delivery van drivers, and 2,226 trajectories of truck drivers. We apply gated recurrent unit neural networks to separately model their gap selection processes. These three models can not only handle class imbalance but also capture long-term interdependencies. The models can predict gap selection of three vehicle classes with geometric mean accuracies of 84% or higher. To obtain insights into their gap selection processes, we apply a gradient-based technique to analyze what neural networks have learned. Our results suggest that there exist significant differences between vehicle classes in terms of the importance of historical information and features. Trucks seem to value a relatively long period, recent 6 seconds, of driving experience to select gaps compared to passenger cars and delivery vans. In addition, the perception of road topology seems to be a significant factor for delivery vans and trucks, contrary to passenger cars which highly value their kinematic features and interactions with surrounding vehicles, to select gaps. These insights offer a novel contribution towards better understanding and modeling of the driving behavior of multiple vehicle classes.

AB  - Anomaly detection in Aviation CPS is critical to ensuring safety and reliability. This systematic literature review explores the landscape of machine learning techniques used for anomaly detection in Aviation CPS, analyzing studies published between 2014 and 2024. The review identifies a strong preference for unsupervised learning methods, driven by the challenges of acquiring labeled data in aviation contexts. Additionally, it highlights the emerging trend of hybrid models that combine supervised and unsupervised techniques, offering improved detection accuracy and robustness. However, the review also reveals significant obstacles, such as the limited availability of publicly accessible datasets, which hampers research progress and the ability to benchmark models. Moreover, while accuracy is the most commonly reported performance metric, the need for a broader evaluation framework that includes precision, recall, and other metrics is emphasized. The findings suggest several directions for future research, including developing standardized datasets, optimizing hybrid models, and integrating explainable AI (XAI) to enhance model interpretability. This review contributes to the field by synthesizing current knowledge and providing insights that could guide the development of more effective and reliable anomaly detection systems for Aviation CPS.

AB  - The exponential growth of blockchain and machine learning (ML) technologies has catalyzed innovations across domains; however, the lack of comprehensive reviews addressing their integration limits our understanding of their synergistic potential. Existing reviews focus on specific applications and neglect scalability, security, and performance metrics that are critical for deploying ML-blockchain frameworks in complex environments. To bridge these gaps, this study conducts a comprehensive review of the most recent state-of-the-art research that evaluates methodologies, performance metrics, and their applicability. The reviewed methods include random forests, federated learning (FL), explainable AI (XAI), reinforcement learning (RL), and federated/hybrid models such as federated reinforcement learning and learning chains. These methods have emerged with the potential to support the balance among accuracy, privacy, and scalability across a variety of domains, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), healthcare, smart grids, and decentralized finance scenarios. This review identifies optimal methods for blockchain optimization and scalability enhancement, while providing a roadmap for integrating advanced ML techniques with blockchains. The findings will assist in significantly advancing domain knowledge in blockchain and guide future research and real-world implementation operations.

AB  - Data farming is a simulation-based methodology used within the defense community to analyze complex systems and provide insights to decision makers. It can produce very large, multi-dimensional data sets that require sophisticated analysis tools, such as metamodeling. Advances in explainable artificial intelligence have expanded the types of metamodels that can be considered; however, constructing a well-fitting machine learning metamodel involves many tasks that can become time consuming for an analyst. Automated machine learning (autoML) can save an analyst time by automating metamodel training, tuning and testing. Using outputs of an agent-based simulation of a military ground-based air defense scenario, we compared the performance of metamodels trained using autoML and different experimental designs. We found that autoML can reasonably automate the construction of metamodels and adds robustness to the analysis by considering multiple types of metamodels; however, the type and size of experimental design can significantly impact metamodel performance.

AB  - Risk scoring provides a simple and quantifiable metric for decision support in cyber security operations, including prioritizing how to address discovered software vulnerabilities. However, scoring systems are often opaque to operators, which makes scores difficult to interpret in the context of their own networks, each other, or in a broader threat landscape. This interpretability challenge is exacerbated by recent applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) for vulnerability assessment, where opaque machine reasoning can hinder domain experts' trust in the decision-support toolkit or the actionability of its outputs. In this paper, we address this challenge through a combination of visualizations and analytics that complement existing techniques for vulnerability assessment. We present a study toward designing more interpretable visual encodings for decision support for vulnerability assessment. In particular, we consider the problem of making datasets of known vulnerabilities more interpretable at multiple scales, inspired by focus and context principles from the information visualization design community. The first scale considers individually scored vulnerabilities by using an explainable AI (XAI) toolkit for an ML risk-scoring model and by developing new visualizations of CVSS score features. The second scale uses an embedding for vulnerability descriptions to cluster potentially similar vulnerabilities. We outline use cases for these tools and discuss opportunities for applying XAI concepts to cyber risk and vulnerability management.

AB  - The advent of Industry 4.0 has reshaped the modern industries (e.g., Manufacturing, Automotive, Aerospace and Defense), driven by the rapid development of artificial intelligence, smart sensing technologies, and interconnected cyber-physical systems. One of the most important goal for Industry 4.0 is the improvement and enhancement in productivity, reduction of production losses, and operational efficiency. High quality fault detection within different environments is the foundation to achieve these goals. Industry 4.0 emphasizes the use of interconnected systems, smart sensors, and advanced analytics, which generate large volumes of data from production environments. The data complexity and scale, product by the widespread deployment of sensors and IoT devices, demands sophisticated Machine Learning (ML) and data-driven methods. In this paper, we argue that the future of accurate and reliable fault detection lies in the seamless fusion of edge-cloud computing, explainable AI, and adaptive machine learning algorithms capable of processing high-frequency, multimodal data streams in real time. Different kinds of advantages for multimondal learning and core enabling techniques are also discussed and revise. This vision paper outlines the future trajectory of multimodal learning based fault detection, via identifying critical research gaps and promising directions for future study.

AB  - The fact that insecticidal pests impair significant agricultural productivity has become one of the main challenges in agriculture. Several prerequisites, however, exist for a high-performance automated system capable of detecting nuisance insects from massive amounts of visual data. We employed deep learning approaches to correctly identify insect species from large volumes of data in this study model and explainable AI to decide which part of the photos is used to categorize the insects from the data. We chose to deal with the large-scale IP102 dataset since we worked with a large dataset. There are almost 75,000 pictures in this collection, divided into 102 categories. We ran state-of-the-art tests on the unique IP102 data set to evaluate our proposed solution. We used five different Deep Neural Networks (DNN) models for image classification: VGG19, ResNet50, EfficientNetB5, DenseNet121, InceptionV3, and implemented the LIME-based XAI (Explainable Artificial Intelligence) framework. DenseNet121 outperformed all other networks, and we also implemented it to classify specific crop insect species. The classification accuracy ranged from 46.31 percent to 95.36 percent for eight crops. Moreover, we have compared our prediction to that of earlier articles to assess the efficacy of our research.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a fast-growing research and development (R&D) discipline which is attracting increasing attention because it promises to bring vast benefits for consumers and businesses, with considerable benefits promised in productivity growth and innovation. To date, significant accomplishments have been reported in many areas that have been deemed challenging for machines, ranging from computer vision, natural language processing, audio analysis to smart sensing and many others. The technology trend in realizing success has developed towards increasingly complex and large-size AI models to solve more complex problems at superior performance and robustness. This rapid progress, however, has taken place at the expense of substantial environmental costs and resources. In addition, debates on the societal impacts of AI, such as fairness, safety, and privacy, have continued to grow in intensity. These issues have reflected major concerns pertaining to the sustainable development of AI. In this work, major trends in machine learning approaches that can address the sustainability problem of AI have been reviewed. Specifically, the emerging AI methodologies and algorithms are examined for addressing the sustainability issue of AI in two major aspects, i.e., environmental sustainability and social sustainability of AI. Then, the major limitations of the existing studies are highlighted, and potential research challenges and directions are proposed for the development of the next generation of sustainable AI techniques. It is believed that this technical review can help promote a sustainable development of AI R&D activities for the research community.

AB  - Cybersecurity is a growing problem in today's technological innovation and new digital economy. Threat actors cause a danger to people's safety or lead to the compromise of intellectual property, either sold on the dark web or used as leverage for ransom. Many executives believe cybersecurity is the responsibility of Information Technologies (IT). It is everyone's responsibility. Countering cyber threats requires focusing on people and behaviors and cognitive models; the mere technicalities are not enough to face the issue. With this in mind, the following research analyzes existing frameworks in the literature for developing serious games for cybersecurity. They are developed to train and educate individuals in various aspects of cybersecurity, including threat detection, incident response, and risk management. Moreover, combining serious games and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be a powerful approach to cybersecurity training and education. By integrating Explainable AI techniques into serious games, users can better understand the decision-making processes within the game environment. Players can learn how to interpret the explanations provided by AI models, identify potential limitations or errors, and make decisions based on both AI-generated insights and their own domain knowledge. This combination equips individuals with the skills to improve perception and human factors in cybersecurity.

AB  - Machine learning (ML) and sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks together present a revolutionary paradigm ready to meet hitherto unheard-of needs in connection, scalability, and intelligence. Including physical-layer signal processing, edge computing, resource optimisation, network slicing, and security, this study provides a thorough and cross-layer study of ML integration into 6G systems. Unlike previous works that concentrate on isolated use cases, this paper systematically classifies and evaluates developing techniques such as federated learning (FL), quantum machine learning (QML), swarm intelligence, and explainable AI within the framework of key 6G performance indicators including ultra-low latency, energy efficiency, and privacy. Presenting a thorough taxonomy and comparative benchmarking, we show the operational trade-offs of centralised, distributed, and meta-learning models. We also find important difficulties like model heterogeneity across ultra-dense networks, adversarial vulnerability in FL, and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS)-assisted privacy risks. Moreover, we describe open research areas and suggest a single orchestration design to support intelligent, scalable, and reliable 6G systems. Researchers and professionals aiming to create strong, ML-driven wireless infrastructures beyond 5G find basic reference in this work.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized human cognitive abilities and facilitated the development of new AI entities capable of interacting with humans in both physical and virtual environments. Despite the existence of virtual reality, mixed reality, and augmented reality for many years, integrating these technical fields remains a formidable challenge due to their disparate application directions. The advent of AI agents, capable of autonomous perception and action, further compounds this issue by exposing the limitations of traditional human-centered research approaches. It is imperative to establish a comprehensive framework that accommodates the dual perceptual centers of humans and AI agents in both physical and virtual worlds. In this paper, we introduce the symmetrical reality framework, which offers a unified representation encompassing various forms of physical-virtual amalgamations. This framework enables researchers to better comprehend how AI agents can collaborate with humans and how distinct technical pathways of physical-virtual integration can be consolidated from a broader perspective. We then delve into the coexistence of humans and AI, demonstrating a prototype system that exemplifies the operation of symmetrical reality systems for specific tasks, such as pouring water. Finally, we propose an instance of an AI-driven active assistance service that illustrates the potential applications of symmetrical reality. This paper aims to offer beneficial perspectives and guidance for researchers and practitioners in different fields, thus contributing to the ongoing research about human-AI coexistence in both physical and virtual environments.

AB  - This work introduces a pioneering methodology aimed at advancing explainability within Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) across multi-modal data domains. Recognizing the intricate nature of GNNs and the challenge posed by their inherent "black-box" characteristics, especially in multimodal learning environments, our approach seeks to demystify these complex decision-making processes. Leveraging Adaptive Subgraph Feature Extraction, we propose a novel framework that dynamically identifies and extracts significant subgraph features contributing to the GNN’s decision-making. This methodology not only illuminates the path to understanding GNN operations but also ensures model transparency without compromising performance. Empirical validation on the comprehensive Amazon dataset demonstrates our approach’s effectiveness, significantly outperforming existing baselines in fidelity, sparsity, validity, and consistency metrics. Our contributions promise a substantial leap towards transparent, explainable, and reliable GNNs in multimodal learning contexts, paving the way for future explorations aimed at refining and expanding the horizons of explainable AI.

AB  - The paper introduces a new interpretable intelligent system aimed at optimizing feature selection for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER), specifically targeting the emotion of ‘Sadness' across multiple datasets. The system employs Genetic Algorithm (GA) to improve classification performance for ‘Sadness' by maximizing the class-wise F1-score. The framework's efficacy is validated across four prominent speech emotion recognition datasets (Ravdess, Savee, Emodb, Tess), and selected features are analyzed using Shapley values to ascertain their significance in achieving high F1-scores. Experiments use a 10-fold cross-validation with a 90:10 split for training and testing data, while hyperparameters are fine-tuned across different algorithms. The framework's explainability analysis is depicted through beeswarm plots to aggregate these results. Additionally, the study analyzes the frequency distribution of selected feature types and how they manifest. The study's focus on explainability provides insights into the significance of selected features in recognizing sadness in speech, thereby paving the way for enhanced human-computer interaction systems.

AB  - Edge intelligence, also called edge-native artificial intelligence (AI), is an emerging technological framework focusing on seamless integration of AI, communication networks, and mobile edge computing. It has been considered to be one of the key missing components in the existing 5G network and is widely recognized to be one of the most sought after functions for tomorrow's wireless 6G cellular systems. In this article, we identify the key requirements and challenges of edge-native AI in 6G. A self-learning architecture based on self-supervised generative adversarial nets is introduced to demonstrate the potential performance improvement that can be achieved by automatic data learning and synthesizing at the edge of the network. We evaluate the performance of our proposed self-learning architecture in a university campus shuttle system connected via a 5G network. Our result shows that the proposed architecture has the potential to identify and classify unknown services that emerge in edge computing networks. Future trends and key research problems for self-learning-enabled 6G edge intelligence are also discussed.

AB  - People of all ages can contract pneumonia, a deadly respiratory illness that is more common in underdeveloped countries. For successful treatment and higher survival rates, pneumonia must be accurately and quickly diagnosed. While chest X-ray imaging is a frequently used diagnostic technique for detecting pneumonia, its interpretation can be arbitrary and error-prone. In this study, we used a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to construct a computer-aided diagnostic system for pneumonia identification in chest X-ray images. Our dataset comprises 5,863 anterior-posterior view X-ray pictures that have been divided into two categories: normal and pneumonia. The photos were chosen from the Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center's pediatric patients between the ages of one and five, and they were first checked for quality control before being judged by two highly qualified doctors. A third expert also reviewed the assessment set to verify correctness. For the test set, our CNN model performed well, with 99% accuracy, 99% precision, 99.25% f1-score, and 98% specificity. To improve the interpretability of our model, we also included explainable AI techniques like Grad-CAM and Grad-CAM++. These approaches offer insights into CNN's decision-making process. Our computer-aided diagnosis system offers a trustworthy and unbiased method for detecting pneumonia in chest X-ray pictures, which can help with the quick identification and treatment of this potentially fatal condition.

AB  - Soft sensors play a vital role in industrial process monitoring and control by estimating difficult-to-measure quality variables. While significant progress has been made in improving the accuracy of soft sensor models, challenges remain in ensuring their interpretability and stability in dynamic industrial environments. From a measurement science perspective, ensuring transparency and reliable performance under varying process conditions is becoming increasingly critical, particularly in high-stakes industrial applications. This article provides a comprehensive review of methodologies to enhance the interpretability and stability of soft sensor models. To address interpretability, we analyze various interpretable machine learning techniques applicable to soft sensors and discuss open-source projects that facilitate the implementation of these techniques. For improving stability, we emphasize the role of causal machine learning, detailing methods for causal discovery in industrial processes and highlighting relevant open-source tools. By highlighting current limitations and identifying areas for improvement, we aim to provide valuable insights and practical tools for researchers and practitioners. These insights will guide the development of more transparent and reliable soft sensors, ultimately enhancing industrial process monitoring and control.

AB  - The efficient administration of healthcare resources is crucial for successful infectious disease control. The merging of technology and medicine has opened the path for revolutionary changes in today's healthcare system. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are one of them that has the potential to radically alter the way healthcare is administered. Using ANNs, this paper presents a novel method dubbed “Dynamic Patient Risk Stratification (DyPRoN).” DyPRoN performs real-time risk assessments of individual patients, allowing for flexible distribution of medical resources. Adaptability to the dynamic nature of infectious illnesses is hindered by the prevalence of static models in conventional approaches. However, DyPRoN uses ANNs to do continuous analysis of patient data, allowing for risk classification in real time. This adaptive method improves healthcare resource management, which in turn helps with infectious disease control.

AB  - The utility of embedding software representations of systems, equipment, and processes within monitoring and control software is not a new concept for solution developers. The authors have been incorporating cyber-physical “surrogate models”, a.k.a. Digital Twins (DTs), within operational intelligent systems software for several decades due to the many advantages such models provide. Because such systems are heterogenous and involve complex system-level interactions that depend on operational context, the addition of an ontologically derived semantic modeling layer on top of the DTs can greatly facilitate reasoning and improve situation awareness and decisioning. Such a semantic DT is referred to as a Cognitive DT (CDT), and the authors now present research and development of an Extended CDT (XDT) architecture that couples the CDT with a semantic orchestration engine (SOE). In the XDT, the semantic layer of the CDT forms an ontological bridge between the digital twin and the orchestration system software and supports the various forms of cognition necessary for evaluating and maximizing likelihoods related to mission success. The XDT can employ advanced data analytics for assessing the current and predicted future states of the system and its processes, evaluate any potential impacts to mission objectives, and then orchestrate any number of optimal responses. In addition to system components, the XDT includes model constructs for mission objectives, tasking, planning, and decisioning, situational workflows, and any number of concepts of operation (CONOPS). The semantic layer of the software also facilitates coding, code understanding, code debugging, testing, and especially system verification and validation (V & V). Furthermore, XDT software can collect semantic evidence and provide textual explanations for its decisions and conclusions. This ability for providing explanations has proven useful for V&V of XDT solution performance and opens the door for conversational run-time knowledge bases.

AB  - The implementation of adaptive optimization in multi-product process manufacturing is a crucial strategy for the reduction of unplanned downtime and the enhancement of overall productivity. Nevertheless, the availability of real-time decision support tools for dynamic adjustments in large-scale industries is currently limited. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel model that processes data collected from extensive manufacturing operations. By leveraging Explainable Artificial Intelligence, we developed a real-time decision support system designed to dynamically adjust process parameters following varying input variables. The proposed model achieved a capture rate of 62% of the minority of products that cause micro-stoppages due to non-compliance with specifications. This approach provides a robust framework for adaptive optimization in complex and large-scale manufacturing environments, enhancing productivity and resilience against unplanned disruptions.

AB  - The escalating integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in various domains, especially Project Management (PM), has brought to light the imperative need for inclusivity in AI systems. This paper investigates the role of AI software in augmenting both the inclusiveness and efficiency within the realm of PM. The research pivots around specific criteria that define and measure the inclusiveness of AI in PM, highlighting how AI, when developed with inclusiveness in mind, can significantly enhance project outcomes. However, there are inherent challenges in achieving this inclusiveness, primarily due to biases embedded in AI learning databases and the design and development processes of AI systems. The study offers a comprehensive examination of AI's potential to revolutionize PM by enabling managers to concentrate more on people-centric aspects of their work. This is achieved through AI’s ability to perform tasks such as data collection, reporting, and predictive analysis more consistently and efficiently than human counterparts. However, the incorporation of AI in PM extends beyond mere efficiency; it represents a paradigm shift in the epistemology of PM, calling for a deeper understanding of AI's role and impact on society. Despite these advantages, the adoption of AI comes with significant challenges, particularly in terms of bias and inclusiveness. Biased AI learning databases, which use shared and reusable datasets, often perpetuate initially discriminatory algorithms. Moreover, unconscious biases and stereotypes of AI designers, developers, and trainers can inadvertently influence the behavior of the AI systems they create. This necessitates a paradigmatic shift in how AI systems are developed and governed to ensure they do not replicate or exacerbate existing social inequalities. The research proposes a methodological approach involving the development of criteria for inclusion and exclusion, alongside data extraction, to evaluate the inclusiveness and efficiency of AI software in enhancing PM. This approach is crucial for understanding and addressing the challenges and limitations of AI in the context of PM. By focusing on inclusiveness, the study underscores the importance of a synergy between technological advancement and ethical consideration, demanding a comprehensive understanding and regulation to mitigate risks and maximize benefits. In conclusion, this paper presents a detailed exploration of AI’s role in PM highlighting both its potential benefits and the ethical challenges it poses. The findings and recommendations of this study contribute to the growing discourse on the need for inclusive AI systems in PM, offering insights for AI developers and Project Managers (PMs) alike.

AB  - The effectiveness of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) is critical in an era where cyber threats are becoming increasingly complex. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models provide an efficient and accurate solution for identifying attacks and anomalies in computer networks. However, using ML and DL models in IDS has led to a trust deficit due to their non-transparent decision-making. This transparency gap in IDS research is significant, affecting confidence and accountability. To address, this paper introduces a novel Explainable IDS approach, called X-CBA, that leverages the structural advantages of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to effectively process network traffic data, while also adapting a new Explainable AI (XAI) methodology. Unlike most GNN-based IDS that depend on labeled network traffic and node features, thereby overlooking critical packet-level information, our approach leverages a broader range of traffic data through network flows, including edge attributes, to improve detection capabilities and adapt to novel threats. Through empirical testing, we establish that our approach not only achieves high accuracy with 99.47% in threat detection but also advances the field by providing clear, actionable explanations of its analytical outcomes. This research also aims to bridge the current gap and facilitate the broader integration of ML/DL technologies in cybersecurity defenses by offering a local and global explainability solution that is both precise and interpretable.

AB  - With the rapid development of face recognition technology based on deep learning, the technology has been widely used in the fields of automatic driving and security monitoring. However, it is limited to the face features based on deep learning are difficult to interpret, which hinders the deep combination of the same identification of forensic science portraits, face 1 to N comparison and artificial intelligence, and affects the application of automatic face recognition in forensic science to a certain extent. In this regard, around the task of interpretability of face features, based on CASIA-FaceV5,LFW,MTFL and other public datasets, combined with the dlib face detection algorithm, to construct an interpretable two-tuple dataset for face recognition with the main focus on redrawn portraits. The number of redrawn portraits is expanded by more than one order of magnitude (10 times) compared with the number of original portraits, and the redrawn region focuses on the key features of portraits. On the basis of integrating two different types of saliency mapping algorithms, combining the mask generation strategy and multi-scale feature fusion, we optimize the way of generating the saliency map of face features. Combined with the two-tuple dataset, the accuracy of the deep learning-based face matching system is initially quantitatively analyzed, so as to improve the application of face matching methods based on face feature similarity scores in the field of scientific image evidence in court.

AB  - Applications for Extended Reality (XR) are rapidly expanding across a wide range of industries, including gaming, entertainment, and healthcare. Accompanying this trend is the field of digital manufacturing, which encompasses a broad range of applications such as quick product design, remote maintenance, production process simulation, employee safety, and training. Industrial personnel may benefit from ergonomic and user-friendly cyber-representations of production processes using XR applications, particularly in the industrial arena. These cyber-representations are utilized to create augmented environments for training, simulation, and testing. The wave of Industry 5.0 (I5.0) applications that are certain to be human-centric and emphasize trustworthy human-machine collaboration cannot be supported by current systems because of several issues, such as the requirement for individualized XR visualizations and new methods for world-building, content production, and flow control aspects of XR systems. The XR5.0 project is presented in this publication with the goal of addressing these issues and offering a revolutionary Person-Centric and AI-based XR paradigm that will be customized to the needs and characteristics of I5.0 applications. The project outlines the organizing concepts and guidelines for utilizing XR in I5.0 applications, with a focus on the creation of cutting-edge "XR-made-in-Europe" technology that complements human-centered manufacturing techniques and upholds European ideals. The associated applications consider the workers’ environment through the incorporation of human-centered digital twins (DTs), which make up the "digital image" of the workers. This allows for the simultaneous design and implementation of an innovative fusion of cutting-edge AI paradigms and XR technology. The added value of the XR5.0 project is discussed, and potential use cases and user journeys are analyzed, leading to a discussion of the project’s revolutionary benefits and additional steps that should be taken.

AB  - This paper investigates the most prominent lines of optical network control evolution, focusing on software-defined networking (SDN), NETCONF/YANG protocols, telemetry techniques, advancements in packet/optical networking, and the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) within optical networks. We show how the integration of SDN with open modeling frameworks allows to devise hierarchical control models where we trade-off between the segregation of proprietary hardware and the creation of open interfaces like in the OpenSDK scenario. In addition, we depict the convergence of packet and optical layers with advancements in coherent technologies and pervasive telemetry techniques to create new flexible scenarios for controlling optical networks. On top of these approaches, the intent-based networking allows to implement configuration solutions using natural primitives. Finally, key applications of AI, mainly machine learning (ML), including quality-of-transmission estimation, failure prediction, and resource optimization, are analyzed to improve optical network control efficiency alongside their challenges, such as energy efficiency and data scarcity. By addressing advances in the aforementioned areas of research, this work outlines the transformative potential of combining programmability, real-time telemetry, and AI to build resilient, adaptive, and sustainable optical infrastructures for the future.

AB  - Deep-learning (DL) techniques have been proposed to solve geophysical seismic facies classification problems without introducing the subjectivity of human interpreters’ decisions. However, such DL algorithms are “black boxes” by nature, and the underlying basis can be hardly interpreted. Subjectivity is therefore often introduced during the quality control process, and any interpretation of DL models can become an important source of information. To provide a such degree of interpretation and retain a higher level of human intervention, the development and application of explainable DL methods have been explored. To showcase the usefulness of such methods in the field of geoscience, we utilize a prototype-based neural network (NN) for the seismic facies classification problem. The “prototype” vectors, jointly learned to have the stereotypical qualities of a certain label, form a set of representative samples. The interpretable component thereby transforms “black boxes” into “gray boxes.” We demonstrate how prototypes can be used to explain NN methods by directly inspecting key functional components. We describe substantial explanations in three ways of examining: 1) prototypes’ corresponding input–output pairs; 2) the values generated at the specific explainable layer; and 3) the numerical structure of specific shallow layers located between the interpretable latent prototype layer and an output layer. Most importantly, the series of interpretations shows how geophysical knowledge can be used to understand the actual function of the seismic facies classifier and therefore help the DL’s quality control process. The method is applicable to many geoscientific classification problems when in-depth interpretations of NN classifiers are required.

AB  - The Rational Unified Process (R.U.P.) is an iterative Software Engineering Process, that ensures alignment between engineers and stakeholders through optimized and detailed partinionalised steps within predefined constraints [1]. The independently deployable services that are components of distributed systems are called microservices. They are part of applications and are easier to manage and scale. Each microservice serve different purpose and has a unique responsibility making it easier to understand manage and collaborate on. Medical applications are created to assist in treatment, disease prevention and health optimization. However patients' needs and abilities vary and patients' requirements and definitions on the usability aspect of an application are different and should be acknowledged for the application to be successful and for the patients/users to benefit from it. In this study the development of an A.I.-infused medical application, is outlined through the R.U.P. methodology and built using microservices, where the patients' needs and requirements are at the center of continuous development process focused on improvements.

AB  - In this study, a novel semantic concept-based inference neural network (SCINN) is proposed to develop a design methodology for the explainable deep neuro-fuzzy models and improve their generalization performance in high-dimensional problems. Traditional neuro-fuzzy models exhibit outstanding interpretability in the problems of lower dimensionality. However, when faced with high-dimensional scenarios, the long rule and rule explosion problems damage their interpretability and result in poor generalization performance, even making them unusable. Although deep neuro-fuzzy models show enhanced performance in handling high-dimensional problems compared to traditional counterparts, they often come at the expense of interpretability. To establish a neuro-fuzzy model that can address high-dimensional problems while preserving the interpretability, the SCINN is proposed with the aid of the concept-based measure generation paradigm (CMGP) and the multi-view information augmentation strategy (MIAS). The CMGP is designed to adaptively define the membership functions (MFs) that correspond to the human-understandable concepts based on the given data; the defined MFs contribute to the construction of the explainable fuzzy rule that can directly process high-dimensional data. The MIAS is structured to develop a unified paradigm for implementing consequence functions in the fuzzy rules, which enhances the approximation ability of the SCINN. The performance of SCINN is evaluated on various image datasets against different competitors, including neuro-fuzzy-based approaches and deep structure-based neural networks. A real-world application is adopted to evaluate its effectiveness. The experimental results show that SCINN outperforms the compared neuro-fuzzy models and is comparable to the deep structure-based neural networks.

AB  - In contrast to the threats to urban human health, impacts of air pollutants on the ecosystem photosynthesis seem to be less concerned. The existence of aerosols could promote photosynthesis by increasing the ratio of diffuse to direct solar radiation; on the contrary, ozone (O3) could inhibit photosynthesis, as it is detrimental to leaf stomata. However, it is unknown whether these two opposite impacts worldwide cancel each other out. In the current mainstream methods, earth system models may show conflicts with in situ experimental results due to their relatively coarse resolution. In virtue of satellite remote sensing and a global eddy covariance (EC) network, we studied ten years of data to explore the impacts of aerosol and O3 on photosynthesis by fitting an explainable machine learning model. The impacts of aerosol on gross primary productivity (GPP) were positive in many cases, yet very weak. By means of the nitrogen dioxide (NO2) to formaldehyde (HCHO) ratio, O3 was seen with positive impacts on photosynthesis under the NOx-sensitive regime, but the apparent positive impacts correlated with the plant phenology. Under the volatile organic compound (VOC)-sensitive regime, the impacts of O3 on GPP were not obvious, which was likely due to the prioritized depletion of O3 by NO2 and VOCs. The impacts of air pollutants depended on many factors and results varied case by case, but the overall net impacts were negative.

AB  - Yield estimation is a critical component of tackling food insecurity, increasing productivity in farming, and informing decisions made with regard to climate shifts and restricted access to such supply inputs. However, these conventional predictive models usually do not achieve what they intend to do because of limited attention to variability in data. This review provides the specifications of the machine learning methodologies for the modeling of crop yield. This paper categorises the regression models, tree-based methods and deep learning framework by looking at the strengths, weaknesses, and areas of implementation depending on the kind of environment in agriculture. Products, including remote sensing, weather data, and soil data, are identified, and details of pre-processing challenges and integration techniques are provided. Comparison of machine learning techniques is done using metrics like MAE, MSE, and R2 Score. Moreover, challenges such as debased quality or interpretability are presented, along with prospective improvements in predictive accuracy and scalability. This research study presents how machine learning might change the precision agriculture and sustainable agriculture practices.

AB  - Identity verification at water and land borders constitutes a great challenge for Border Authorities and relevant technology providers due to the continuous variability and complexity of the border crossing points. In the meantime, identity fraud continuously evolves requiring novel mechanisms for secure and seamless identity verification. ODYSSEUS introduces a set of novel biometric-based mechanisms that will allow EU citizens that are or not part of the Schengen area to cross the borders across the Member States in a secure and frictionless manner. Seamless identity verification based on facial biometric will perform 1:N matching without requiring from the user to stop at the border. A novel Digital and Virtual passport will allow EU citizens to verify their identity through a mobile wallet, which will be protected through AI-powered continuous behavioural authentication. Each of the technologies will be explained through X-AI for improved result interpretation and reasoning, while the results of each of the technologies will be fused through the Decision Support System (DSS) into an overall identity risk score provided to the Border Authorities. A faceless person counting component will allow Border Authorities to further predict potential queues at the border crossing points and perform relevant adjustments. The platform will be validated in water and land Schengen borders showcasing the increase in productivity and reduction of queues at the borders.

AB  - Public safety in disaster operations relies heavily on accurate predictions which help minimize flood damages. The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network demonstrates exceptional forecasting abilities in time-series applications thus making it an ideal choice for flood prediction operations. The presented research design implements a data-based flood prediction model which unites LSTM neural networks and collects hydrological information together alongside meteorological and topographical data to enhance forecasting precision. The predictive model uses IoT sensor along with satellite observation data to optimize hyperparameter adjustments which leads to better generalization outcomes. The forecasting performance is validated by three metrics including RMSE, MAE and R² which ensure dependable results. The model tackles three common limitations such as scarce data and excessive noise and calculation restrictions using transfer learning and regularization capabilities and cloud storage deployment. The experimental results show that LSTM maintains superiority over conventional statistical models and brings an effective scalable flood risk management system. The research investigates both hybrid AI systems and explainable AI approaches for enhancing AI readability and accuracy levels.

AB  - Detection and classification of anomalies in industrial applications has long been a focus of interest in the research community. The integration of computational and physical systems has increased the complexity of interactions between processes, leading to vulnerabilities in both the physical and cyber layers. This work presents a model structure for anomaly detection in the Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled industrial cyber-physical systems (CPSs), enabled by wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The model comprises three primary data blocks in the cyber layer: sensor-based data acquisition, data fusion to convert raw data into useful information, and analytics for decision-making. The rationale behind these blocks highlights the critical role of anomaly detection and is demonstrated through three use cases, namely fault selection in power grids, anomaly detection in an industrial chemical process, and prediction of the CO2 level in a room. Furthermore, we integrate explainable AI (XAI) algorithms into an IoT-based system to enhance error detection and correction, while fostering user engagement by offering useful insights into the decision-making process. Our numerical results demonstrate high accuracy in anomaly detection across these scenarios, significantly improving system reliability and enabling timely interventions, which could ultimately reduce operational risks.

AB  - Agent-based modeling (ABM) involves developing models in which agents make adaptive decisions in a changing environment. Machine-learning (ML) based inference models can improve sequential decision-making by learning agents’ behavioral patterns. With the aid of ML, this emerging area can extend traditional agent-based schemes that hardcode agents’ behavioral rules into an adaptive model. Even though there are plenty of studies that apply ML in ABMs, the generalized applicable scenarios, frameworks, and procedures for implementations are not well addressed. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of applying ML in ABM based on four major scenarios, i.e., microagent-level situational awareness learning, microagent-level behavior intervention, macro-ABM-level emulator, and sequential decision-making. For these four scenarios, the related algorithms, frameworks, procedures of implementations, and multidisciplinary applications are thoroughly investigated. We also discuss how ML can improve prediction in ABMs by trading off the variance and bias and how ML can improve the sequential decision-making of microagent and macrolevel policymakers via a mechanism of reinforced behavioral intervention. At the end of this article, future perspectives of applying ML in ABMs are discussed with respect to data acquisition and quality issues, the possible solution of solving the convergence problem of reinforcement learning, interpretable ML applications, and bounded rationality of ABM.

AB  - The massive and increasing availability of mobility data enables the study and the prediction of human mobility behavior and activities at various levels. In this paper, we address the problem of building a data-driven model for predicting car drivers' risk of experiencing a crash in the long-term future, for instance, in the next four weeks. Since the raw mobility data, although potentially large, typically lacks any explicit semantics or clear structure to help understanding and predicting such rare and difficult-to-grasp events, our work proposes to build concise representations of individual mobility, that highlight mobility habits, driving behaviors and other factors deemed relevant for assessing the propensity to be involved in car accidents. The suggested approach is mainly based on a network representation of users' mobility, called Individual Mobility Networks, jointly with the analysis of descriptive features of the user's driving behavior related to driving style (e.g., accelerations) and characteristics of the mobility in the neighborhood visited by the user. The paper presents a large experimentation over a real dataset, showing comparative performances against baselines and competitors, and a study of some typical risk factors in the areas under analysis through the adoption of state-of-art model explanation techniques. Preliminary results show the effectiveness and usability of the proposed predictive approach.

AB  - The varied soil conditions across India pose a notable challenge for farmers to select the right crops. This leads to under-utilized resources and restricts agricultural output, ultimately contributing to the global shortage of food. Given the increasing world population, there is a necessity to increase productivity in agriculture to meet the rising demand for food. To address this, This research aims to revolutionise precision agriculture by integrating a Crop Recommender System (CRS) with a Weighted Stacked Generalization Ensemble architecture enhanced with interpretability features by designating the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model as the meta-classifier within the ensemble framework. LSTM, with abilities to learn effectively from sequential data, is the overarching model that combines the predictions of various base learners. The ability of Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) to deliver transparent insights for the decision-making processes intends to improve the interpretability of the prediction in practical agricultural contexts. The focus of this work is to improve the precision of crop recommendations’ by amalgamating diverse models’ predictive capabilities by leveraging LSTM as the meta-classifier combined with stacked ensemble learning integrated with LIME interpretations which represents a significant advancement in providing farmers with reliable decision-support tools. The proposed system enables informed decision-making and facilitates the adoption of precision agriculture technologies.

AB  - Deep-Fakes have sparked concerns throughout the world because of their potentially explosive consequences. A dystopian future where all forms of digital media are potentially compromised and public trust in Government is scarce doesn't seem far off. If not dealt with the requisite seriousness, the situation could easily spiral out of control. Current methods of Deep-Fake detection aim to accurately solve the issue at hand but may fail to convince a lay-person of its reliability and thus, lack the trust of the general public. Since the fundamental issue revolves around earning the trust of human agents, the construction of interpretable and also easily explainable models is imperative. We propose a framework to detect these Deep-Fake videos using a Deep Learning Approach: we have trained a Convolutional Neural Network architecture on a database of extracted faces from FaceForensics' DeepFakeDetection Dataset. Furthermore, we have tested the model on various Explainable AI techniques such as LRP and LIME to provide crisp visualizations of the salient regions of the image focused on by the model. The prospective and elusive goal is to localize the facial manipulations caused by Faceswaps. We hope to use this approach to build trust between AI and Human agents and to demonstrate the applicability of XAI in various real-life scenarios.

AB  - The current clinical practice in thyroid nodule malignancy detection and diagnosis consists of ultrasound (US or sonogram) imagery, followed by guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy if deemed necessary. FNA is performed based on the expert knowledge of trained clinicians, who assess the malignancy risk of the thyroid nodule(s). Thyroid malignancy risk assessment based on ultrasound images rely on experience and heuristics, which cannot be directly and reliably converted into rule-based algorithms. Thus, deep learning-based automated methods for nodule segmentation and risk-assessment are designed as aids for radiologists to enable them to provide timely and successful cancer treatment to patients. Existing AI methods for analyzing thyroid ultrasound imagery are designed to perform either nodule segmentation or output an objective belief of malignancy that drives the decision to perform an FNA. AI solutions that simply output a probability of malignancy suffer from lack of reliability and explainability, and are usually not trusted by clinicians. Radiologists rely on the American College of Radiology TI-RADS system for malignancy risk assessment. TI-RADS requires visual analysis of features such as nodule margin, composition, echogenicity, shape and echogenic foci. AI models need to incorporate this domain knowledge to achieve explainability and earn the trust of clinicians. We aim to take a step in this direction by designing a multi-task deep-learning model that performs three important tasks: thyroid nodule segmentation, sonogram feature detection, and explain the risk of malignancy. We evaluate our technique quantitatively using the Thyroid Ultrasound Cine-Clip Dataset from Stanford for training and testing. On the Stanford dataset, our framework achieves an mIoU of $71 \%$ for segmentation and $\mathbf{6 5 \%}$ accuracy for high/low risk classification. Additionally, we use the Thyroid Digital Image Database (TDID) to test on a different dataset than the training set with a segmentation mIoU of $\mathbf{6 5 \%}$ and a risk classification accuracy of $\mathbf{6 4 \%}$.

AB  - Interpretable machine learning (IML) algorithms use mathematical principles of machine learning to assist know-how, perception, and manipulation of scientific facts. Those algorithms aim to bridge the gap between clinicians’ knowledge of the facts and the output of traditional predictive analytics. IML algorithms have proved suitable for diverse obligations related to records analysis and interpretation of scientific facts, inclusive of predicting medical responses to remedy, exploring medical pathways, predicting future medical outcomes, and clustering affected person populations. Numerous techniques may be employed while using IML algorithms, which include linear fashions, choice tree models, help vector machines, neural networks, and Bayesian networks. Those fashions are mixed with specific parameters, including feature selection and weighting that can be used to evaluate the importance of every characteristic in predictive models. Moreover, those models can be implemented for non-linear facts by using regularization techniques. One essential advantage of IML over traditional devices in getting to know algorithms is the capacity to interpret the version outputs. Through using interpretable facts visualizations consisting of bar plots, scatter plots, and heat maps, clinicians can take advantage of insights into the relationships among features and goal variables.

AB  - In this paper, we study the use of causal reasoning for a cognitive network where we investigate causal discovery and its use in the context of 6G. The fundamental requirement in causal inference is to discover the causal relation among variables in a complex system (such as among a number of network KPIs). Once such causal relations are correctly captured, the cognitive capability of a network can significantly be increased by having the ability of causal and counterfactual reasoning. We envision that this can additionally bolster the trust and transparency to such cognitive system. First, we attempt to discover a causal graph that represents the causal relation in a networking setup. By applying the state-of-the-art causal discovery algorithms that include both constraint and score-based methods, we aim at uncovering which network KPIs and actions are causally impacting each other. It is observed that the causal discovery algorithms are able to capture the causal relations between the network KPIs and actions, reasonably well. Then, we give a use-case example within an autonomous network context, and evaluate the estimated causal graph with our realistic network emulator to predict the impact of an intervention on a network KPI. The preliminary results are promising and pave the way for more focused future studies that can support complex commercial networks in a scalable way.

AB  - Operating at a large scale and impacting large groups of people, automated systems can make consequential and sometimes contestable decisions. Automated decisions can impact a range of phenomena, from credit scores to insurance payouts to health evaluations. These forms of automation can become problematic when they place certain groups or people at a systematic disadvantage. These are cases of discrimination-which is legally defined as the unfair or unequal treatment of an individual (or group) based on certain protected characteristics (also known as protected attributes) such as income, education, gender, or ethnicity. When the unfair treatment is caused by automated decisions, usually taken by intelligent agents or other AI-based systems, the topic of digital discrimination arises. Digital discrimination is prevalent in a diverse range of fields, such as in risk assessment systems for policing and credit scores [1], [2].

AB  - The rapid convergence of generative AI (GAI), neuro-symbolic reasoning, and quantum computing has redefined secure communication and networking. Owing to the massive amount of data, the need for extensive computing power, and the necessity to find and mitigate threats in real time, traditional security measures cannot keep up with changing cyber threats as the communication infrastructure becomes more complicated. Therefore, this paper investigates the potential of a GAI-enhanced neuro-symbolic quantum framework for building security systems that are strong, scalable, and self-sufficient. This method improves threat detection, encryption, and real-time adversarial defense by combining symbolic reasoning for logic, deep learning for pattern recognition, and quantum intelligence to accelerate computations. This work has made progress in creating the next generation of secure networks that can automatically and adaptively make security decisions in real-time, providing robust protection in communication environments that change over time.

AB  - Crop leaf diseases pose a significant challenge to global agriculture, leading to substantial economic losses and reduced yields. These ailments, caused by various pathogens, manifest as symptoms such as leaf discoloration and impaired photosynthesis, severely impacting crop health and productivity. Existing classification methods face challenges related to accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability. This study introduces an innovative solution that combines a meticulously designed lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture with a channel attention (CA) mechanism for extracting crucial features and leverages the discriminative power of an extreme learning machine (ELM) for classification. The lightweight CNN developed demonstrates significantly reduced training times. Additionally, the CA mechanism within the model effectively prioritizes channel-wise critical features while eliminating irrelevant and redundant ones. An empirical evaluation is conducted using a publicly available dataset and the proposed model achieves a flawless 100% accuracy in distinguishing between 39 distinct crop leaf diseases. Furthermore, the study employs gradient class activation maps (Grad-CAM) visualization to delve into the model’s decision-making process, shedding light on influential factors and regions. It holds the promise of transforming crop health and agricultural yields, instilling hope for farmers and researchers dedicated to achieving agricultural prosperity and sustainability.
