AB  - Accurate forecasting of crude oil futures prices is crucial for guiding energy investment strategies, managing market risk, and informing policy decisions. This study proposes NewsSent-CFS-GBO-TFT, an interpretable deep learning framework that integrates cutting-edge artificial intelligence techniques with practical financial engineering methods. The framework begins by extracting sentiment signals from unstructured news text using a pretrained language model, which are then integrated with a wide range of economic variables—such as supply–demand dynamics, financial market conditions, and macroeconomic uncertainty—to form a comprehensive feature set. To address the challenges of high-dimensional data, we propose a Collaborative Feature Selection (CFS) strategy that utilizes multiple evaluation criteria to assess feature importance from various perspectives, effectively reducing redundancy and improving model robustness and generalization. Additionally, the model leverages a Gradient-Based Optimizer (GBO) to simultaneously refine the architecture and hyperparameters of the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), delivering both accurate point forecasts and multi-level confidence interval estimates. Empirical results demonstrate that the NewsSent-CFS-GBO-TFT model outperforms traditional benchmark models in both forecast accuracy and uncertainty quantification. Interpretability analysis reveals that short-horizon predictions are primarily influenced by trading day effects and temporal signals, while medium- and long-term forecasts increasingly reflect macroeconomic factors and geopolitical risks. The proposed approach offers transparent, high-fidelity predictive insights, providing valuable decision-support tools for investors, risk managers, and policymakers navigating volatile market environments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Prototype explanations of machine learning models have been considered solely for static data, while their use for concept drifting data still remains underexplored. In this work, this challenge is addressed using the algorithm that explains the predictions of the Random Forest tree ensemble classifier with a limited number of prototypes. This also involves the proposal of new measures to evaluate prototypes in static and evolving settings, enabling comparison of prototype sets before and after the data change and the construction of new drift detectors. The presented proposals are evaluated through many experiments. In the first experiments with synthetic datasets, the new measures – mean minimal distance, mean centroid displacement, and prototype reassignment impact – proved effective when evaluated using a set of diverse synthetic data generators and real-world data streams. Then, for incremental learning, the RACE-P algorithm is introduced, leveraging prototypes for interpretable drift detection. Experiments demonstrate competitive performance against established detection methods such as ADWIN and Page–Hinkley. Additionally, the use of prototypes to analyse and explain detected drifts is discussed, underscoring their potential to enhance understanding of data evolution. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Current methods for assessing asphalt pavement compaction quality are very time-consuming. Existing non-destructive test methods have significant drawbacks. This study proposes a rapid and intelligent detection system to evaluate the real-time pavement quality in 1 s. The multi-frequency Ultrasonic Pulse Velocities (UPVs) are measured in the field, through which the dynamic elastic parameters of asphalt mixtures are derived. A high-fidelity dataset is established with multi-scenario field tests. A series of intelligent models is developed to estimate the pavement quality. After optimizations, the proposed model demonstrates high accuracy and strong generalization in validations. Interpretable Machine Learning models are adopted to quantitatively reveal the influential mechanism of variables on the final quality. An intelligent measurement system is integrated with the testing Eqs.equipment, data processing module, visualization, and assessment models, achieving rapid assessment of the compaction quality of asphalt pavements. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The functioning of marine ecosystems depends on key processes such as climate regulation and water quality. Phytoplankton, unicellular microalgae at the base of marine food webs, play a central role in these dynamics that are threatened by global change. Although abiotic factors (e.g., temperature) are well studied, biotic interactions (i.e., between species) are poorly understood. Classical machine learning models, while effective at prediction, often operate as black boxes and provide limited biological interpretability. Meanwhile, symbolic and qualitative modeling approaches, which could offer greater explanatory power, remain largely underused in marine ecology. To address this gap, we investigate phytoplankton interactions using an explainable machine learning method, LFIT (Learning From Interpretation Transition), which infers logical rules from observational time series data. Adapting this framework required methodological contributions, notably a species-specific discretization strategy informed by ecological theory. The extracted rules enable the construction of an interaction graph, where edges represent probable interspecies interactions. This graph offers an interpretable representation of the dynamics of the community and helps identify key drivers of the development of phytoplankton. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Photovoltaic (PV) energy has been significantly utilized in China and plays an important role in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and fulfilling energy needs. However, its rapid development may result in negative impacts on the green environment. In this study, we assessed the positive and negative impacts of PV construction on the green environment in China from 2012 to 2022. We used the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to represent the green environment and conducted an analysis from the perspectives of PV construction areas (CAs) and the surrounding impact areas (SIAs). Via the use of a temporal framework covering the preconstruction, construction, and postconstruction periods, we analyzed the changes in the green environment in the CAs and SIAs across different geographical divisions, as well as the differences among land cover types. Furthermore, we employed the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to reveal the factors influencing changes in the green environment. The results indicated that (1) from 2012 to 2022, 53.25% of the PV systems had a positive impact on the green environment. Notably, Northwest China exhibited significant improvement, whereas East China and Central China exhibited severe degradation, and the extent of impact in the SIAs decreased with increasing distance from CAs. (2) The green environment deteriorated during the preconstruction period, followed by a continued reduction during the construction period (2016–2017) and an improvement within one year after construction (2017–2018), and ultimately, general enhancement was noted during the postconstruction period. (3) PV systems occupied 35.15% of grasslands and 30.17% of croplands. During the preconstruction and construction periods, the green environment in grassland and cropland areas deteriorated notably. Conversely, barren land exhibited the most substantial recovery during the postconstruction period and demonstrated a significant improvement in the green environment across all periods. (4) Climatic factors contributed the most to changes in the green environment, and their impacts in the SIAs intensified with increasing distance from CAs. GST and PRE were the most important factors in the CAs, but the importance of GST significantly decreased in the SIAs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Assessing how people typically move across public areas like city squares, shopping centers, airports, train stations, metro hubs, etc., is a relevant task required to both perform informed decisions for infrastructure design and to identify unusual behaviors to support surveillance activities. Thanks to the development of computer vision algorithms, methods for detecting and tracking pedestrians offer nowadays valid solutions to tackle this problem. However, most of the state-of-the-art approaches exploit color images that can pose threats to people’s privacy. Additionally, the classification of trajectories to estimate local origin-destination matrices and enable analysis of typical people flow is still poorly addressed. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a complete solution able to detect, track, and classify people flows in complex junctions by exploiting privacy-preserving thermal cameras. Thanks to a thorough examination of several machine learning methods, and to the identification of a new set of features for trajectory classification, also evaluated with eXplainable AI approaches, the proposed solution has been capable to obtain accurate trajectory classification – achieving an F1-score of 0.96 – that can be exploited to compute local origin-destination matrices. Moreover, early classification in real time using partial trajectories is possible. The solution has been implemented exploiting the Snap4City Smart City Digital Twin infrastructure and has been carried out in the context of CN MOST, the Italian National Center on Sustainable Mobility. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) enhances transparency and interpretability in AI models, which is crucial for trust and accountability in healthcare. A potential application of XAI is disease prediction using various data modalities. This study conducts a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) following the PRISMA protocol, synthesizing findings from 30 selected studies to examine XAI’s evolving role in disease prediction. It explores commonly used XAI methods, such as Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), and their impact across medical fields in disease prediction. The review highlights key gaps, including limited dataset diversity, model complexity, and reliance on single data types, emphasizing the need for greater interpretability and data integration. Addressing these issues is crucial for advancing AI in healthcare. This study contributes by outlining current challenges and potential solutions, suggesting directions for future research to develop more reliable and robust XAI methods. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Explainable and interpretable machine learning has emerged as essential in leveraging artificial intelligence within high-stakes domains such as healthcare to ensure transparency and trustworthiness. Feature importance analysis plays a crucial role in improving model interpretability by pinpointing the most relevant input features, particularly in disease subtyping applications, aimed at stratifying patients based on a small set of signature genes and biomarkers. While clustering methods, including unsupervised random forests, have demonstrated good performance, approaches for evaluating feature contributions in an unsupervised regime are notably scarce. To address this gap, we introduce a novel methodology to enhance the interpretability of unsupervised random forests by elucidating feature contributions through the construction of feature graphs, both over the entire dataset and individual clusters, that leverage parent-child node splits within the trees. Feature selection strategies to derive effective feature combinations from these graphs are presented and extensively evaluated on synthetic and benchmark datasets against state-of-the-art methods, standing out for performance, computational efficiency, reliability, versatility and ability to provide cluster-specific insights. In a disease subtyping application, clustering kidney cancer gene expression data over a feature subset selected with our approach reveals three patient groups with different survival outcomes. Cluster-specific analysis identifies distinctive feature contributions and interactions, essential for devising targeted interventions, conducting personalised risk assessments, and enhancing our understanding of the underlying molecular complexities. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Heart failure (HF) is a highly heterogeneous condition, and current methods struggle to synthesize extensive clinical data for personalized care. Using data from 343 HF patients, we developed mechanistic computational models of the cardiovascular system to create digital twins. These twins, consisting of optimized measurable and unmeasurable parameters alongside simulations of cardiovascular function, provided comprehensive representations of individual disease states. Unsupervised machine learning applied to digital twin-derived features identified interpretable phenogroups and mechanistic drivers of cardiovascular death risk. Incorporating these features into prognostic AI models improved performance, transferability, and interpretability compared to models using only clinical variables. This framework demonstrates potential to enhance prognosis and guide therapy, paving the way for more precise, individualized HF management. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The source area of the Yangtze River (SAYR), part of the Tibetan Plateau, is an ecologically fragile alpine region sensitive to climate change. Current research has predominantly examined hydrological and ecological responses as isolated systems, failing to address the coupled mechanisms through which permafrost degradation mediates water-carbon interactions‌. In this study, we used a fully coupled eco-hydrological model that integrates permafrost processes, along with multi-source remote sensing data, experimental monitoring, and machine learning, to quantify the water retention and carbon sequestration capacity over the past 20 years. The region was categorized into three risk zones based on changes in soil moisture, net ecosystem productivity (NEP), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) fluxes in streams. We evaluated eight factors, including precipitation, temperature, vegetation phenology and cover, and their contributions to changes of water retention and carbon sequestration using an interpretable machine learning approach. Results show that the central and eastern regions of the study area face the highest risk of declining water retention and carbon sequestration capacity. The changes of temperatures and precipitation have led to depletion of soil water and carbon reserves. This depletion raises concerns about the potential shift from a carbon sink to a carbon source considering land-to-river carbon loss. Our study provides critical insights into the water and carbon flux dynamics and offers valuable guidance for water resource and ecological management in alpine river systems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Construction land, as the primary carrier of human industrial, residential, and transportation activities, represents a major source of carbon emissions. Exploring the impact of different types of construction land on carbon emissions is of critical importance for carbon reduction. Existing literature typically assesses the influence of different construction land types on carbon emissions at the block scale. While the block-scale analysis is limited by local environmental, complicating broader spatial impact assessments. In this study, we adopt advanced land use data from China's Third National Land Survey to measure the broad impact of different types of construction land on carbon emissions at county scale. The interpretable machine learning method was employed to analyze the global, local, and interactive effects of these construction land categories on carbon emissions. Our findings reveal that commercial, industrial, and residential lands exhibit positive associations with carbon emissions, while public facilities, special-use, and transportation lands demonstrate inhibitory effects. Importantly, the impact of construction land on emissions displays significant spatial heterogeneity. Industrial and commercial lands predominantly influence emissions in developed areas, whereas residential land's impact is more pronounced in developing regions. Furthermore, we observe that interactions between most types of construction land can inhibit carbon emissions, suggesting potential synergies in land use planning for emission reduction. These findings contribute to the broader understanding of how land use patterns influence carbon emissions and can inform more effective, targeted approaches to sustainable urban development and climate change mitigation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Context: Precision agriculture leverages advanced technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance crop productivity by providing data-driven insights. In Bangladesh, optimizing crop recommendations using real-time soil and environmental data is crucial for improving agricultural decision-making. However, integrating AI models with IoT devices for instantaneous crop prediction remains a challenge due to computational constraints and the need for model interpretability. Objective: This study aims to develop an IoT-based crop prediction system that utilizes real-time data on soil nutrients, pH, and weather conditions. The system employs machine learning and deep learning techniques to recommend suitable crops based on local environmental factors. The implementation focuses on deploying the best-performing models on an edge device for real-time predictions as well as ensuring accuracy, efficiency, and accessibility for farmers and agricultural stakeholders. Methods: The system was developed in Bangladesh using proprietary data from the Soil Resource Development Institute, supported by Habiganj Agricultural University, Sylhet. The dataset consists of 3,300 samples covering 22 crops and eight soil and environmental features. Several machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Stacking ensembles, as well as deep learning models such as TabNet, were evaluated for crop prediction. The best-performing models were deployed on a Raspberry Pi 5 edge device for real-time inference. A weather API was integrated for local humidity and rainfall data, while an RS485 7-in-1 agricultural soil sensor provided real-time measurements of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), pH, temperature, and soil moisture. The predictions were displayed on the ThingsBoard IoT platform. Model interpretability was enhanced using the explainable AI technique LIME. A user survey involving farmers, agricultural researchers, and students assessed the usability, accuracy, and reliability of the system. Results and conclusions: The highest accuracy among machine learning models was achieved using Random Forest (95.8%) and Gradient Boosting (95.5%). The Stacking ensemble technique, with Support Vector Classifier (SVC) as the meta-classifier, achieved the highest overall accuracy of 95.9%. Among deep learning models, TabNet performed best with an accuracy of 92%. The Random Forest model was selected for deployment on the Raspberry Pi due to its lowest inference time and compatibility with Python and TensorFlow Lite. User feedback from the survey provided insights into the system's practical effectiveness and potential areas for improvement. The results demonstrate that integrating AI-driven crop recommendation models with IoT devices can support real-time agricultural decision-making, improving precision farming outcomes. Significance: This study contributes to precision agriculture by demonstrating an IoT-based crop prediction system that integrates AI-driven recommendations with real-time environmental monitoring. The deployment of the best-performing model on an edge device ensures accessibility and efficiency for users in agricultural settings. By leveraging explainable AI techniques, the study enhances model interpretability, fostering trust and usability among farmers and agricultural researchers. The findings highlight the potential of AI and IoT in improving crop selection, optimizing resource usage, and supporting sustainable agricultural practices in Bangladesh and beyond.

AB  - Since Jane Jacobs introduced the concept of urban vibrancy in 1961, it has become a focal point of multidisciplinary research. However, existing literature lacks further exploration of intra-city differences. Therefore, this study uses Guangzhou as a case study, with HD and CBD as comparison groups, to comprehensively measure urban vibrancy and quantify its associations with built environment factors. First, urban vibrancy is measured using multi-source big data across four dimensions: population, facilities, social media, and offline consumption. Second, the XGBoost and SHAP-based interpretation with regional pooled modeling are employed to analyze the nonlinear and threshold effects of built environment factors on vibrancy. The results indicate: (1) The comprehensive vibrancy of CBD is slightly higher than that of HD. (2) Population density and the number of caterings are key factors in both HD and CBD. (3) The impact trends of the same variables on urban vibrancy in HD and CBD are similar, yet the threshold effects differ significantly. This study contributes by dissecting the vibrancy differences between areas with different functions and historical contexts within a city. The findings suggest that urban planners and scholars should acknowledge intra-city vibrancy differences and pay attention to the nonlinear and threshold effects of urban vibrancy mechanisms. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This article introduces an optimization framework based on a large language model, designed for detecting fake news and using an evolutionary algorithm to optimize prompt design. Our methodology systematically incorporates a broad array of features, including linguistic style, text complexity, and psychological factors, to facilitate a comprehensive and transparent analysis of news content, thereby enabling more explainable detection outcomes. Initially, the framework augments the training phase with a preprocessing component that utilizes robust estimation techniques to refine data evaluation and enhance outcome quality. Subsequently, an evolutionary algorithm refines the original feature set, significantly enhancing the accuracy of fake news detection models. In the final stage, this optimized subset of features is integrated with a large language model, facilitating precise authenticity assessments of news articles. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets confirm that our approach outperforms existing models by filtering out suitable feature sets that generate effective prompts. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Agriculture is essential for sustaining the global food supply, supporting economies, and promoting environmental balance. Among pulse crops, black gram is highly valued for its nutritional content and contribution to agricultural economies. However, its productivity is significantly impacted by diseases that cause loss of yield. Current methods of detecting disease are labour-intensive, prone to error, and lack scalability. In this study, a deep learning framework for black gram leaf disease classification is developed. LeafVisionNet utilizes a modified SqueezeNet backbone, chosen for its lightweight and efficient architecture, enhanced with a Multi-Path Semi-Local Feature Enhancement (MPSLFE) block and a Coordinate Attention (CA) module. This architecture effectively captures integral semi-local features, while also focusing on salient regions through integrated spatial and channel attention mechanisms. The integration of XAI, further improves the interpretability of the network and provides insights into disease-affected regions. The proposed LeafVisionNet is the first work to be evaluated on the IDBGL dataset, reaching 99.02 % accuracy and 98.96 % F1-score, outperforming state-of-the-art architectures. The LeafVisionNet was validated across four additional datasets, BAU-Insectv2, MangoLeafBD, BPLD, and BananaLSD, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability, with accuracies of 97.14 %, 98.00 %, 98.09 % and 99.37 %, respectively. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Marine biomass composition analysis traditionally requires time-consuming processes and domain expertise. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometry (REIMS) combined with advanced machine learning (ML) techniques for accurate marine biomass composition determination. Using fish species and body parts as model systems representing diverse biochemical profiles, we investigate various ML methods, including unsupervised pretraining strategies for transformers. The deep learning approaches consistently outperformed traditional machine learning across all tasks. For fish species classification, the pretrained transformer achieved 99.62% accuracy, and for fish body parts classification, the transformer achieved 84.06% accuracy. We further explored the explainability of the best-performing and predominantly black box models using local interpretable model-agnostic explanations and gradient-weighted class activation mapping to identify the important features driving the decisions behind each of the best performing classifiers. REIMS analysis with ML can be an accurate and potentially explainable technique for automated marine biomass composition analysis. Thus, REIMS analysis with ML has potential applications in quality control, product optimization, and food safety monitoring in marine-based industries. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Micro-mobility plays an increasingly vital role in urban transportation, yet research on the micro-mobility behavior resilience remains limited. This study employs shared bicycle data from Shenzhen before, during, and after extreme weather events to develop a novel framework for assessing the micro-mobility behavior resilience. First, the Soft DTW-based K-medoids time series clustering method was employed to explore dynamic spatiotemporal patterns of community response and recovery within sub-districts, traffic analysis zones (TAZs), and cell grids. This analysis revealed the emergence of three distinct patterns across various community spatial and temporal scales. Then, resilience was quantified using the resilience triangle principle, with the impact of the built environment analyzed through the GW-lightGBM model. The model using TAZs as the research unit performed the best. Finally, the study analyzed the spatially heterogeneous effects and nonlinear associations of the built environment on micro-mobility behavior resilience within the top-performing model. Socioeconomic attributes were found to have the highest average contribution to micro-mobility resilience, with road density and rooftop density also playing significant roles. The findings offer valuable insights for data-driven approaches to quantify and analyze disaster behaviors, establish resilience measurement standards, and devise planning strategies to optimize local resource allocation and cultivate highly resilient cities. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Climate change and urbanization have increasingly exacerbated the threat of storm floods to urban metro systems. To enhance the flood emergency management of metro systems, this study proposes a two-stage stochastic optimization model. In this model, the closure decisions for risky stations and the allocation of flood control resources are implemented before and during the rainstorm, respectively, to maximize the average utility of passengers in the metro network. A case study on the Shanghai metro system is conducted to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed model. The results indicate that the two-stage stochastic optimization model can generate refined closure schemes and dynamically adaptive protection schemes for risky metro stations. Compared to one-stage strategies that do not consider the uncertainty of rainstorms, the two-stage model achieves higher passenger utility. Furthermore, the mechanisms behind the closure decisions made by the two-stage model are interpreted using an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) technique, SHAP (SHapley Additive explanation). It is revealed that a metro station with low passenger volume in a high-rainfall sub-catchment has a greater probability of being closed before floods. Future works can be conducted to further explore feedback mechanisms between the two optimization stages or optimize the location and inventory of resource warehouses for metro systems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study empirically compares multiple eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to interpret short-term (weekly) machine learning-based burglary predictions at the micro-place level in Ghent, Belgium. While previous research predominantly relies on SHAP to interpret spatiotemporal crime predictions, this is the first study to systematically evaluate SHAP alongside other XAI techniques, offering both global and local model interpretability within the context of crime prediction. Using data from 2014 to 2018 on residential burglary, repeat and near-repeat victimization, environmental features, socio-demographic indicators, and seasonal effects, we trained an XGBoost model with 76 features to predict weekly burglary hot spots. This model serves as a basis for comparing the interpretative power of different XAI techniques. Our results show that built environment and land use characteristics are the most consistent global predictors of burglary risk. However, their influence varies substantially at the local level, revealing the importance of spatial context. While global feature importance rankings are broadly aligned across XAI techniques, local explanations, especially between SHAP and LIME, often diverge. These discrepancies highlight the need for careful method selection when translating predictions into crime prevention strategies. In addition, this study demonstrates that short-term burglary risks are influenced by complex interactions and threshold effects between environmental and social disorganization features. We interpret these findings through the lens of criminological theory, and argue for more integrated approaches that go beyond examining the isolated effects of specific crime predictors. Finally, we call for greater attention to the methodological implications that arise from applying different interpretability techniques, particularly when machine learning model outputs are used to inform crime prevention and policy decisions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Although using artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze ultrasound images is a promising approach to assessing thyroid nodule risks, traditional AI models lack transparency and interpretability. We developed a multimodal generative pre-trained transformer for thyroid nodules (ThyGPT), aiming to provide a transparent and interpretable AI copilot model for thyroid nodule risk assessment and management. Ultrasound data from 59,406 patients across nine hospitals were retrospectively collected to train and test the model. After training, ThyGPT was found to assist in reducing biopsy rates by more than 40% without increasing missed diagnoses. In addition, it detects errors in ultrasound reports 1,610 times faster than humans. With the assistance of ThyGPT, the area under the curve for radiologists in assessing thyroid nodule risks improved from 0.805 to 0.908 (p < 0.001). As an AI-generated content-enhanced computer-aided diagnosis (AIGC-CAD) model, ThyGPT has the potential to revolutionize how radiologists use such tools. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Driving behavior analysis is pivotal for advancing intelligent transportation systems, a key domain of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). This study presents an innovative and cohesive framework that seamlessly integrates Personalized Federated Learning (PFL), Digital Twin (DT) technology, Crowdsensing, and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). By addressing critical challenges such as privacy protection, heterogeneous data management, and real-time adaptability, this framework enhances the synergy between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and CPS to deliver personalized, interpretable, and actionable feedback to drivers. Crowdsensing provides real-time driving and environmental data, which the Digital Twin uses to simulate various driving scenarios and generate localized datasets. These simulations support PFL by improving personalization and addressing data heterogeneity through dynamic clustering and Proximal Regularization (μ‖w−wg‖2), ensuring an effective balance between local and global models. A hybrid Convolutional Neural Network-Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-BiLSTM) model extracts spatiotemporal features to enhance prediction accuracy, while XAI, utilizing Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), provides transparent and actionable insights to users. Together, these components form a synergistic system that overcomes traditional limitations. Validated driving behavior data from Mendeley and Kaggle were used for evaluation, along with weather data collected from the open-meteo.com website. The results demonstrate that this framework outperforms existing approaches, achieving a 20 % improvement in prediction accuracy, a 15 % increase in F1-Score, a 50 % reduction in prediction time, and a 20 % decrease in communication costs. This comprehensive approach contributes to the evolution of trustworthy and ethical AI solutions within CPS, with applications in intelligent transportation and beyond. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The development of intelligent chemical industry urgently calls for high-accuracy digital twin modeling methods of actual chemical processes. However, although intelligent technologies such as deep learning are utilized, digital twin modeling is challenged by the complexity and nonlinearity of actual chemical processes, leading to unexpected deviations and poor generalization. To provide a valuable modeling methodology in this field, a novel deep learning framework based on chemical process mechanisms is developed. According to the properties of different neural networks, the framework is designed in a hierarchical way to learn the underlying process mechanisms and deal with the nonlinearity of actual chemical processes. Thus, a digital twin model of the actual chemical process can be developed, which is high-accuracy and good-generalization. Based on the sensor data from the distributed control system of an actual industrial distillation process, the proposed deep learning digital twin modeling framework is verified by thoroughgoing and careful analyses, including the modeling test, ablation experiment and residue distribution analysis of model results. Compared with wide-spread baseline models, the new framework decreases the predicting mean absolute error by 45.6 % and increases the coefficient of determination by 13.8 % on average. This intelligent framework reveals desirable application potentials that it can create a high-fidelity digital twin of actual chemical processes. Such digital representation acts as a basic model, which can support advanced manufacturing tasks such as real-time optimization by detailed digital inference. This work provides an intelligent digital twin modeling methodology in chemical engineering and facilitates the development of intelligent chemical industry. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This review article presents an analysis of Artificial intelligence (AI) applications in ocean and maritime engineering, examining the evolution, current trends, and future directions of AI in the field. A key finding is the transformative impact of Reinforcement Learning (RL), which enables real-time adaptation in dynamic and uncertain marine environments, essential for applications such as autonomous navigation, vessel control, and route optimization. Additionally, the study identifies the promising potential of hybrid AI models, which combine optimization algorithms, fuzzy logic, and deep learning to address the complex, nonlinear challenges inherent in maritime structures and fluid-structure interactions. Looking ahead, the review highlights several promising directions: the expansion of RL into new domains such as coastal erosion modelling and flood prediction; the adoption of transformer architectures for time-series forecasting; and the growing importance of Explainable AI (XAI) and digital twins for transparent and trustworthy deployment in safety-critical systems. As the industry moves towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), the article stresses the need for robust regulatory frameworks, ethical safeguards, and the preservation of human oversight to ensure responsible and effective integration of AI technologies in maritime applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The roughness of the soil surface directly affects seedbed preparation, sowing operations and crop yield. The roughness of the soil surface depends on the equipment used in the tillage process. Evaluating the performance of this equipment is important for increasing agricultural productivity. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and image processing technologies use convolutional neural network (CNN) models that can automatically learn meaningful patterns from images, enabling the objective analysis of soil surface roughness. Rather than analyzing a single CNN model, ensemble deep learning (EDL) approaches combining predictions from multiple CNN models improve classification accuracy. The aim of this study is to classify soil surface images obtained from primary tillage operations performed with a newly developed mouldboard ploughshare (NDP) and a conventional mouldboard ploughshare (CP) using the EDL method. Images were taken from the field to evaluate the soil surface structure using NDP and CP after primary tillage. These images were then enhanced using the gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) method to generate heat maps, and the generated images were classified using known CNN and EDL models. The hard voting technique was used for the EDL approach. The Voting 6 model achieved 98.3 % accuracy. In addition, according to the results of the profilometer measurement, it was determined that the soil cutting and fragmentation performance of NDP was higher than that of CP. As a result, this image-based method can significantly contribute to the testing process of primary tillage tools. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The mass manufacturing of high-end mechanical products demands rigorous assembly quality control, but systemic variations in equipment performance, operator interventions, and environmental conditions challenge predefined process parameters’ optimality. This necessitates data-driven modeling to establish quantifiable process-quality relationships for adaptive optimization. However, complex manufacturing systems inherently exhibit strong dynamism, limited sample availability, and multimode characteristics, which generate aleatoric, epistemic, and out-of-distribution (OOD) uncertainties in current approaches, particularly deep learning (DL) architectures. Meanwhile, the black-box nature of DL further obscures assembly quality prediction interpretability. Therefore, this study proposes an uncertainty-aware Bayesian neural network (UABNN) integrated with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for data-driven assembly quality prediction. The UABNN quantifies epistemic uncertainty through hierarchical parameter distributions, models aleatoric uncertainty via stochastic residuals, and detects OOD instances using feature perturbation analysis. Additionally, SHAP interpretability correlates uncertainty bounds with feature contributions, enabling global sensitivity analysis and localized defect diagnosis. Validated on industrial datasets from diesel engine assembly lines, the framework demonstrates superior prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification reliability compared to conventional DL approaches. It establishes a reliable process-quality model for optimizing assembly parameters in dynamic environments, addressing the trade-off between model transparency and performance by delivering confidence intervals for predictions and explicit feature contribution rankings. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Accurately predicting building information modeling (BIM) user satisfaction (US) is essential for proactively addressing implementation challenges, ensuring effective adoption, and maximizing return on investment in BIM technologies in construction projects. Accordingly, this study developed advanced, interpretable boosting ensemble models to predict BIM US by integrating the forensic-based investigation (FBI) algorithm with gradient boosting machine, light gradient boosting machine, adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), extreme gradient boosting, and random forest algorithms. To validate the proposed models and establish a dataset, a comprehensive survey was conducted on 70 construction projects in Taiwan that used BIM technologies to support design work. Subsequently, the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) was integrated into the proposed models to address the data imbalance problem. The results indicated that among all models, the FBI-AdaBoost-SMOTE model exhibited the highest performance, achieving accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores of 88.6 %, 90.6 %, 88.6 %, and 87.8 %, respectively. The FBI-AdaBoost model based on Shapley additive explanations identified contextual analysis and visualization, project scale, and cost estimates as key determinants of BIM US. Overall, this study presents an advanced machine learning framework for predicting BIM US and identifying key influencing factors for BIM US. It also provides actionable insights for stakeholders to enhance BIM implementation and user experience. In addition, this study highlights the potential of predictive modeling for optimizing the adoption of BIM in the architecture, engineering, and construction industry. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Data-driven design of concrete attracts increasing interests in waste valorization and decarbonization but lacks generalizability and reliability without concrete domain knowledge. Recent research suggests that knowledge graphs are promising for imparting concrete knowledge into data-driven design, yet manual construction of knowledge graphs is inefficient and hard to scale. This paper presents a multi-agent collaboration framework to streamline knowledge-guided data-driven design of green concrete. The framework decentralize design tasks among specialized agents, and a large language model-based approach is developed to automate the extraction of concrete knowledge for constructing concrete knowledge graphs. The framework has been applied to create a knowledge graph and design green ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC). The primary novelties of this research involve the multi-agent collaboration framework for designing UHPC and the automatic extraction of UHPC knowledge for constructing the knowledge graph. Results show that concrete knowledge is imparted into data-driven design of UHPC and enables explicit interpretation of machine learning outcomes regarding physical and chemical mechanisms, advancing the transition from purely data-driven to knowledge-guided design of eco-friendly composite materials. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The classification of mental health conditions using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals has gained increasing attention due to its non-invasive nature and potential for early diagnosis. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) plays a crucial role in enhancing the interpretability of machine learning models; however, traditional XAI methods often suffer from high computational costs and redundant feature selection. In this study, we propose Envolving Explainable Artificial Intelligence (E-XAI), an evolutionary XAI framework that leverages Genetic Algorithms (GA) to efficiently search for the optimal EEG feature subset, reducing computational overhead while maintaining interpretability. Furthermore, this work integrates Digital Twin technology, enabling a dynamic and adaptive representation of EEG-based mental states. The proposed framework allows real-time monitoring, remote diagnosis, and personalized mental health interventions by continuously updating the digital twin model with real-time EEG data. This enhances model adaptability, robustness, and scalability for mental health classification. Experimental results on a benchmark EEG dataset demonstrate that E-XAI with Digital Twin technology significantly reduces the computational time of XAI techniques while improving the classification performance and interpretability of mental health classification systems. This advancement provides a promising pathway for real-time, scalable, and intelligent EEG-based mental health analysis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Medical insurance fraud detection is crucial for minimizing the depletion of insurance pools. While medical expense records (MER) are valuable for this task, their limited availability is often overlooked. Extant studies directly input MER into high-dimensional machine learning (ML) models to achieve fraud detection. Another class of models generates fraud prediction based on probability modelling of samples. To explore whether these two different classes of models can cross-fertilizer each other, this paper incorporates Bayesian network (BN) into extreme gradient boosting (XGB). After obtaining the healthcare fraud predictions, this study employs these results to risk management decisions for minimizing the cost of Medical Insurance Bureaus. To make the optimal cost-based decision, we develop an instance-dependent cost-sensitive XGB (ICXGB) method. Using real-world data, we construct various variables based on the famous Recency, Frequency and Monetary (RFM) principle and empirically assess the prediction performance of probabilistic model and ML. The integrative model shows a significant improvement over BN and ICXGB. Finally, a post-hoc explanation method is adopted to quantify the contributions of the predictors and obtain some management implications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study addresses the challenge of mold prevention in built environments through a machine learning approach for portfolio-wide severity prediction utilizing existing facility management datasets. While mold exposure is associated with respiratory health complications and substantial economic burden, contemporary prediction methodologies predominantly rely on micro-climate specific models requiring detailed hygrothermal data from environmental monitoring systems. Traditional approaches—such as experimentally derived growth functions or deterministic numerical models—produce surface-level mold growth indices for specific materials but provide limited insight into building-wide mold severity at portfolio scale. We demonstrate that a Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) framework with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) techniques can effectively predict mold severity across building portfolios using U.S. Army Corp's (USACE) Sustainment Management System (SMS) data. Analysis revealed several key predictors of mold severity, such as the air changes per hour of the air handlers, the tonnage of the air condensers, how much a building was inspected, and the age of the building. Residential and storage structures also exhibited higher susceptibility to mold and moisture issues. This methodological approach offers a transition from material-specific assessments toward building-wide preventative strategies that complement established facility management protocols. The model provides interpretable insights that inform building science applications through identification of structural and operational determinants of mold development, supporting more efficient resource allocation for remediation across diverse building portfolios. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Ride-splitting, a special kind of ride-hailing service, presents significant potential for energy savings and emission reduction. Studying factors that promote ride-splitting can help build sustainable transportation systems. Although many studies have analyzed the impact of the built environment and sociodemographic variables on ride-splitting, there is a lack of consideration of variables specific to ride-hailing systems. This study aims to analyze the complex impact of explanatory variables (including ride-hailing system-specific variables) on ride-splitting, based on an interpretable machine-learning framework. Firstly, the price ratio between shared and solo trips, the distance passengers wait for the driver to pick them up (called passenger waiting distance), and the driver's detour index are extracted from Beijing's data. Then, a machine learning-based framework combining XGBoost and SHAP is constructed. The explained variables are the daily trip numbers of ride-splitting and solo ride-hailing between origin–destination (OD) pairs. The results show that price ratio, passenger waiting distance, and detour index have a greater impact on ride-splitting than solo ride-hailing. Based on SHAP values, a nonlinear threshold-based relationship between individual variables and ride-splitting demand is investigated. Exogenous variables related to the high adoption of ride-splitting include OD pairs having trip durations shorter than 20 min, a zonal per capita GDP below a certain threshold, and being located away from the city center. The interaction effects of multiple variables on ride-splitting, such as distance from the origin/destination to the city center and travel time, are investigated based on the SHAP interaction value. These findings help to adapt specific variables to facilitate the shift from solo trips to shared trips, which is conducive to more sustainable transportation patterns. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Accurate construction cost prediction is vital for project management, influencing budgeting, resource allocation, and overall success. This study proposes a comprehensive framework that combines machine learning models, uncertainty quantification through Confidence Intervals, and explainable AI techniques using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to enhance transparency and decision-making. Ten machine learning models, including Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Elastic Net, K-Nearest Neighbor Regression, and advanced ensemble methods such as XGBoost, CatBoost, and HistGradient Boosting, were evaluated on the RSMeans dataset. Among these, HistGradient Boosting achieved the best performance on the testing dataset. Beyond traditional metrics, Confidence Intervals quantified prediction reliability, and SHAP identified critical cost drivers like “Formwork” and “Tributary Area,” enabling interpretable and robust prediction. This study highlights the potential of machine learning models to revolutionize construction cost estimation by integrating predictive accuracy, uncertainty analysis, and explainability. The proposed framework supports resource efficiency and enables process innovation in cost management. It also contributes to the advancement of sustainable building practices, offering a strong foundation for future research and promoting the adoption of machine learning-based solutions with enhanced transparency and confidence. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study aims to develop and evaluate a natural gradient boosting (NGBoost) model optimized with Optuna for estimating ground settlement during tunnel excavation, incorporating Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) to perform interpretability analysis on the model's estimation results. The model's predictive performance was comprehensively assessed using datasets from two earth pressure balance shield tunneling projects in Changsha and Zhengzhou, China. Comparative analyses demonstrated the superior accuracy and generalization capability of the Optuna-NGBoost-SHAP model (training set: R2 = 0.9984, MAE = 0.1004, RMSE = 0.4193, MedAE = 0.0122; validation set: R2 = 0.9001, MAE = 1.3363, RMSE = 3.2992, MedAE = 0.3042; test set: R2 = 0.9361, MAE = 0.9961, RMSE = 2.5388, MedAE = 0.2147). SHAP value analysis quantitatively evaluated the contributions of input features to the model's estimations, identifying geometric factors (distance from the shield machine to the monitoring section and cover depth) as the most important features. The findings provide robust decision support for safety management during tunnel construction and demonstrate the reliability and efficiency of the Optuna-NGBoost-SHAP framework in estimating complex ground settlement scenarios. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods have recently emerged to gain insights into complex machine learning models. XAI can be promising for environmental and Earth system science because high-stakes decision-making for management and planning requires justification based on evidence and systems understanding. However, an overview of XAI applications and trust in AI in environmental and Earth system science is still missing. To close this gap, we reviewed 575 articles. XAI applications are popular in various domains, including ecology, engineering, geology, remote sensing, water resources, meteorology, atmospheric sciences, geochemistry, and geophysics. XAI applications focused primarily on understanding and predicting anthropogenic changes in geospatial patterns and impacts on human society and natural resources, especially biological species distributions, vegetation, air quality, transportation, and climate-water related topics, including risk and management. Among XAI methods, the SHAP and Shapley methods were the most popular (135 articles), followed by feature importance (27), partial dependence plots (22), LIME (21), and saliency maps (15). Although XAI methods are often argued to increase trust in model predictions, only seven studies (1.2%) addressed trustworthiness as a core research objective. This gap is critical because understanding the relationship between explainability and trust is lacking. While XAI applications continue to grow, they do not necessarily enhance trust. Hence, more studies on how to strengthen trust in AI applications are critically needed. Finally, this review underlines the recommendation of developing a “human-centered” XAI framework that incorporates the distinct views and needs of multiple stakeholder groups to enable trustworthy decision-making. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The development of explainable health indicators (HIs) for multi-component mechatronic systems is vital for monitoring their performance, ensuring their reliability, and optimizing their operational efficiency across a wide range of industries. These indicators play a pivotal role in detecting and diagnosing faults, assessing system health, and guiding maintenance decisions. However, achieving explainability in HIs poses significant challenges, including the selection of the most relevant sensors, the accurate modeling of degradation trends influenced by maintenance activities, and the integration of component dynamics into a system-level representation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel methodology for constructing hierarchical HIs — a two-level structure where component-level degradation signals are first modeled individually, then systematically aggregated to form a comprehensive system-level health representation. The proposed approach, named TRSAE, incorporates an automated sensor selection process to identify the most important sensors, reducing redundancy while improving interpretability. Furthermore, maintenance and downtime effects are explicitly integrated into the modeling process to ensure a more realistic and reliable assessment of system health. By tackling these challenges, our methodology improves transparency in system behavior, strengthens diagnostic capabilities, and builds trust in predictive maintenance decisions. The proposed methodology is validated through a case study in an iron mining system, an environment characterized by extreme operating conditions and continuous heavy loads that accelerate the degradation of critical components. The case study demonstrates how hierarchical HIs can capture complex degradation dynamics, optimize sensor usage, and improve remaining useful life (RUL) predictions, offering actionable insights for proactive maintenance planning and reliable system operation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Water distribution systems (WDS) face complex challenges, including real-time monitoring, operational efficiency, and resilience under varying hydraulic conditions. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers promising solutions but is often held back by its lack of transparency. This paper presents a novel framework integrating Explainable AI (XAI) with graph signal processing to enhance the interpretability of AI models applied to WDS. Specifically, it models multilayer perceptrons as dynamic, weighted, directed graphs to analyse hydraulic states. Using eigencentrality as a central graph metric, this approach identifies key drivers influencing model predictions, offering insights into both global and local system behaviour. The methodology is validated using a metamodel for hydraulic state estimation, leveraging real-world WDS benchmarks. Comparative analyses with state-of-the-art XAI approaches, such as the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP values) and Integrated Gradients (IG), demonstrate the robustness, adaptability, and computational efficiency of the proposed novel framework, with processing times that are over 70 times faster. This enables real-time applications in digital twins for WDS. Moreover, the methodology supports sensor prioritization and maintenance strategies, emphasizing critical components for system resilience. The results highlight the synergy between graph theory and XAI, showcasing a scalable, transparent tool for sustainable urban water management. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Pedestrianization promotes active modes of transportation and provides many benefits related to the environment, economy, health, and mobility. Nonetheless, it has often faced widespread opposition from residents and business owners. Therefore, it is essential to examine the effectiveness of pedestrianization programs (i.e., transforming streets into car-free zones). Objectives: This study investigates the influence of different variables on pedestrianization effectiveness in Montreal, Canada. The effectiveness of pedestrianization is evaluated in terms of frequency and duration of walking trips, duration spent in street shops, and route change. Methods: An online survey was distributed in Montreal. A powerful machine learning method (XGBoost) is used for modeling, and two interpretation techniques (SHapley Additive exPlanations and Partial Dependence Plots) are used to interpret the results of XGBoost. The performance of the developed interpretable machine learning approach is compared with Ordinal Logistic Regression. Results: The top variables impacting the effectiveness of pedestrianization are the level of agreement in redoing pedestrianization projects every year, the opinion on the influence of pedestrianization on individual mobility, the level of satisfaction with urban furniture of pedestrian streets, the level of satisfaction with the attractiveness of pedestrian streets, and age. Conclusions: Positive attitudes toward pedestrianization and active travel satisfaction are the top determining factors in supporting pedestrianization, and they play a vital role in the effectiveness of pedestrianization programs. Therefore, improving the urban furniture and the attractiveness of car-free streets increases the effectiveness of these projects. Among socio-demographics, age is the top variable, and pedestrianization is the most effective for individuals between 33 and 45 years. Accordingly, policymakers should prioritize the implementation of such projects in areas with the highest concentration of this age group to maximize their effectiveness. Further, travel behavior changes are highly dependent on the trip purpose and the built environment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Activated carbon (AC) is widely used for organic micro-pollutants (OMPs) removal, yet adsorbability evaluation remains challenging due to molecular diversity and adsorbent heterogeneity, especially given the limitations of traditional assessment metrics such as hydrophobicity (logD). This study proposed a machine learning (ML)-driven assessment strategy by aligning the adsorbability of various AC adsorbents with a hypothetical “Standard AC” to evaluate the adsorbabilities across 56 OMPs. XGBoost, RF, and ET models achieved high prediction accuracy on the test set (R2 = 0.88–0.98, RMSE = 0.17–0.38, MAE = 0.13–0.27), and were further validated against a published experimental dataset. Interpretable ML analysis identified a logD threshold of ≈ 2, at which the dominant adsorption mechanisms transitioned from hydrophobic interactions for OMPs with higher hydrophobicity to π-π interactions, hydrogen bonding, and pore-filling for those with lower hydrophobicity. Adsorbability increased with molecular weight, as flexible molecules (rotatable bond ratio > 0.012) overcame steric hindrance in micropores, enhancing pore-filling efficiency through improved accessibility. By introducing a standardized, data-driven adsorbability reference and elucidating the intrinsic interplay between molecular properties and adsorption mechanisms, this study offers a robust framework for knowledge-informed treatability evaluation and a practical benchmark to guide adsorption process design. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Energy performance in detached homes is critical for reducing carbon emissions in United Kingdom. However, understanding the complex factors that affect Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) ratings remains limited. Detached homes face unique challenges due to their larger floor areas and greater environmental exposure. Despite the significance of EPCs in driving energy efficiency, the diagnostic analysis of feature interactions at the class level (A–G) is underexplored, especially in detached homes. This study addresses this gap by employing predictive explainability to provide a detailed, rating class-wise diagnostic analysis of the predictive power of structural and operational features for detached homes. We investigate key factors such as CO2 emissions per floor area, heating costs, window, floor, walls efficiency, and construction age, and explore how these features interact to drive EPC ratings. Our findings show that CO2 emissions and heating costs are the primary drivers of EPC classification, but their impact varies across EPC bands. Detached homes in lower EPC categories (E–G) exhibit heightened sensitivity to high emissions and inefficient heating, while properties in EPC A and B benefit from improved insulation and efficient systems. This study introduces an innovative diagnostic framework that not only identifies key predictive features for each EPC class but also uncovers the synergistic effects of feature combinations. The results provide actionable insights for retrofit strategies and policy interventions, particularly for detached homes, offering a roadmap for improving energy efficiency and advancing sustainable energy practices. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Digital Twins are often intertwined with machine learning and, more recently, deep reinforcement learning methods in their architecture to process data and predict future outcomes based on input data. However, concerns about the trustworthiness of the output from deep learning models persist due to neural networks generally being regarded as a black box model. In our work, we developed crop rotation policies using explainable tabular reinforcement learning techniques. We compared these policies to those generated by a deep Q-learning approach by generating five-step rotations, i.e. producing a series of five consecutive crops. The aim of the rotations is to maximise crop yields while maintaining a healthy nitrogen level in the soil and adhering to established planting rules. Crop yields may vary due to external factors such as weather patterns or changes in market prices, so perturbations have been added to the reward signal to account for those influences. The deployed explainable tabular reinforcement learning methods collect, on average, at least as much reward over 100 crop rotation plans when randomly starting with any crop compared to the deep learning model. For the perturbed case, robust tabular reinforcement learning methods collect similar amounts of reward across 100 crop rotation plans compared to the non-random reward setting, whereas the deep reinforcement learning agent collects even fewer rewards compared to learning on non-perturbed rewards. Thus, we contribute a novel random rewards approach and a corresponding robustification to increase the resilience of the proposed crop rotation planning methodology. By consulting with farmers and crop rotation experts, we demonstrate that the derived policies are reasonable to use and more resilient towards external perturbations. Furthermore, the use of interpretable and explainable reinforcement learning techniques increases confidence in resulting policies, thereby increasing the likelihood that farmers will adopt the suggested policies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study examines the relationship between multidimensional street-level built environment (SBE) features and urban vitality, as measured by the floating population (FP) in Seoul, South Korea. We employ deep learning (DL), machine learning (ML), and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)—alongside street view imagery (SVI) and GPS mobility data (GMD). The regression results indicate that pedestrian infrastructure, urban density, street liveliness, and street furniture positively contribute to urban vitality, whereas green infrastructure and open space exhibit negative associations. Beyond previous research, this study reveals nonlinear and threshold effects: for instance, green spaces initially enhance FP but exhibit diminishing returns, while open spaces display a U-shaped relationship, contributing positively at lower levels but decreasing within a mid-range interval. This study also confirms interaction effects between SBE on urban vitality; for instance, pedestrian infrastructure most strongly promotes FP in areas with low to moderate urban density. Our contributions can be categorized into two key areas: (1) expanding urban vitality theory with empirical evidence and (2) refining the role of built environment features through a non-linear and interactive lens. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Evidence has shown the importance of built environment features in shaping park use and physical activity behaviour. However, it is unclear what impacts built environment features within and around parks have on older adults' park visits. To address this gap, this study employs an interpretable machine learning model to investigate a variety of built environment features within and around parks and their association with device-measured park visits of older adults. We found that macroscale built environment features around parks (i.e. intersection density) had an important role in shaping older adults' park visits and were generally more important than microscale built environment features within (i.e. amenities) and around parks (i.e. park access). Additionally, the macroscale built environment features of neighbourhoods were more predictive of older adults' park visits than those of park buffers. Among the microscale built environment features studied, park sports facilities appear to be the most influential, followed by aesthetic features. Research findings suggest that key built environment features influence older adults' park visits in combination, highlighting the importance of a more holistic perspective when considering built environment influences on behaviour, including understanding the wider neighbourhood context of parks, and integrating such perspectives in future research and policymaking. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The maintenance of an optimal inflammatory homeostasis within the body is crucial for its sustained viability within a natural environment replete with pathogenic factors. The real-time, precise detection of two antagonistic cytokines (pro- and anti-inflammatory) in an inflammatory state is fundamental to the guidance of precise clinical treatments and thus the achievement of inflammatory homeostasis. Herein, we synthesized AuAg-ZIF, which resulted in a dual enhancement of the fluorescence properties of AuNCs (35-fold increase in fluorescence intensity and 18.5-fold increase in quantum yield) by the anti-galvanic reaction between the surface Ag(I) and core Au (0), as well as by the confinement effect of ZIF-8. Furthermore, a generalized fluorescence immunoassay utilizing liposome-mediated Cu2 +-induced fluorescence quenching of AuAg-ZIF has been developed, resulting in amplification of the antigenic signal. Additionally, an interpretable machine learning prediction algorithm was constructed, comprising feature extraction, feature dimensionality reduction, model construction and validation, and model interpretation. This algorithm achieves immediate and accurate detection of factors related to anti-inflammatory, pro-inflammatory, and inflammatory levels in the human inflammatory homeostasis (R2 > 0.95), which is in line with the accuracy of the current commercial assay kits. This integration of dual-enhanced fluorescent nanoscale materials, amplification strategies, and interpretable machine learning enables the real-time, accurate observation of inflammatory homeostasis, thereby facilitating the delivery of precision clinical treatments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Ever since Yau’s non-constructive existence proof of Ricci-flat metrics on Calabi-Yau (CY) manifolds, finding their explicit construction remains a major obstacle to development of both string theory and algebraic geometry. Recent computational approaches employ machine learning to create novel neural representations for approximating these metrics, offering high accuracy but limited interpretability. In this paper, we analyse machine learning approximations to flat metrics of Fermat CY n-folds and some of their one-parameter deformations in three dimensions in order to discover their new properties. We formalise cases in which the flat metric has more symmetries than the underlying manifold, and prove that these symmetries imply that the flat metric admits a surprisingly compact representation for certain choices of complex structure moduli. We show that such symmetries uniquely determine the flat metric on certain loci on the Fermat manifold, for which we present an analytic form. We also incorporate our theoretical results into neural networks to reduce Ricci curvature for multiple CY manifolds compared to previous machine learning approaches. We conclude with distilling the ML models to obtain closed form expressions for Kähler metrics with near-zero scalar curvature, discovering them directly from numerical data. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The detection of plant leaf diseases is essential for ensuring crop health and productivity. This study uses a comprehensive merged dataset, including the Mendeley Plant Leaf Dataset, which includes 22 classes, while the Jute and Mulberry datasets provide 2 classes each, representing healthy and diseased categories from various species. The final dataset, consisting of 26 classes, was augmented to ensure 500 training samples per class. In this study, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) was employed for zero-shot segmentation, enabling the automatic extraction of precise regions of interest (ROIs) from leaf images without the need for task-specific training for region-focused analysis. An EfficientNetB7- Multi-Head Attention (MHA) model that combines EfficientNetB7 with MHA was used to improve plant disease classification across 26 distinct classes. The proposed model is designed to handle the variety and diversity of leaf diseases, achieving a high classification accuracy of 98.01%, with precision, recall, and F1-scores all exceeding 97.9%. The integration of MHA allows the model to focus on disease-specific features, significantly enhancing its ability to generalize across diverse agricultural settings while maintaining scalability. Experimental results show that the EfficientNetB7-MHA model consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in terms of accuracy and robustness, making it a promising tool for precision agriculture. Explainable AI (XAI) including the use of Grad-CAM was utilized to detect the precise regions of interest for each class providing interpretability and insights into the model’s decision-making process. Finally, to demonstrate the model’s performance, a web application was developed that displays the predicted outputs when given different images of healthy and diseased leaves from the dataset. This comprehensive approach demonstrates significant potential for improving agricultural disease management through accurate, scalable, interpretable, and efficient disease detection. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Accurate mapping of the composition, process, and property relationship is essential for online predicting and controlling mechanical properties in hot-rolled alloy steel. However, this remains a challenge due to persistent data silos in hot strip rolling (HSR) and the limited interpretability of “black box” machine learning (ML) models in capturing complex multivariable interactions. This study developed a four-layer industrial digital twin platform to integrate multisource heterogeneous data into a unified dataset, including composition, process parameters and properties. A dataset reconstruction strategy was introduced to address the challenges posed by large-scale, nonlinear, and noise-prone data. Based on the reconstructed inputs, interpretable ML models were established to characterize the underlying composition-process-property relationships accurately. The light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) model, optimized using particle swarm optimization, achieved superior performance with an R2 of 0.80 and a mean absolute error of 10.02 MPa on the test set. Shapley additive explanations and partial dependence plot analyses further revealed the combined effects of alloying elements, rolling temperature, and deformation on mechanical behavior. The proposed framework was successfully implemented on a 1422 mm HSR production line, providing real-time guidance for alloy design and reducing reliance on manual sampling. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Timber as a construction material is experiencing its renaissance, while fire safety is a critical factor for timber-based building design. Currently, the fire resistance rating of wood-steel-wood (WSW) connections is evaluated using empirical equations derived from experimental results. However, these equations consider a limited set of parameters and lack interpretability. This paper developed an explainable machine learning (ML) model considering comprehensive parameters related to connection's configuration, based on 140 experimental and experimental-validated numerical data. The performances of various machine learning models are evaluated in terms of predicting the fire resistance rating of connections after hyperparameter tuning. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model outperforms other ML models (R2=0.93) and empirical equations. The local sensitivity analysis (LSA), global sensitivity analysis (GSA), and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis are conducted based on the XGBoost model to investigate the contributions of nine parameters to the fire resistance rating. Both sensitivity analysis and SHAP analysis identify timber thickness and load ratio as the primary factors influencing fire resistance. Finally, the calibrated XGBoost model is incorporated into a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to optimize the design, aiming to minimize the self-weight of the connection while maximizing the fire resistance rating and load-carrying capacity of the connection subjected to constraints on limited dimensions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Groundwater quality assessment is essential for ensuring sustainable water resource management, particularly in regions heavily dependent on groundwater for domestic and agricultural needs. This study aims to investigate the hydrochemical characteristics and assess the drinking water quality of groundwater in the Ithikkara River Basin, a tropical region in southern India, by integrating hydrogeochemical methods with unsupervised learning and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). A total of 111 groundwater samples were analysed for major ions, hydrochemical facies, and water quality indices. Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) identified three distinct groundwater clusters, each exhibiting unique geochemical signatures. Hydrochemical facies analysis revealed dominant Na⁺-Cl⁻ and mixed Ca²⁺-Na⁺-HCO₃⁻ types, influenced by silicate weathering, cation exchange, and anthropogenic activities. The Entropy Water Quality Index (EWQI) showed that 89.4 % of samples were of excellent to good quality, with moderate-quality zones located near agricultural and industrial areas. A Random Forest-based ensemble model achieved high predictive accuracy (R² = 0.871), and SHAP analysis revealed Na⁺, K⁺, and TDS as the primary contributors to water quality degradation. The integration of SOM clustering with interpretable machine learning offers a powerful framework for understanding groundwater evolution and guiding sustainable water management in tropical river basins. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged to reduce clinical resources and standardize auto-contouring of organs-at-risk (OARs). Although CNNs perform adequately for most patients, understanding when the CNN might fail is critical for effective and safe clinical deployment. However, the limitations of CNNs are poorly understood because of their black-box nature. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) can expose CNNs’ inner mechanisms for classification. Here, we investigate the inner mechanisms of CNNs for segmentation and explore a novel, computational approach to a-priori flag potentially insufficient parotid gland (PG) contours. Methods: First, 3D UNets were trained in three PG segmentation situations using (1) synthetic cases; (2) 1925 clinical computed tomography (CT) scans with typical and (3) more consistent contours curated through a previously validated auto-curation step. Then, we generated attribution maps for seven XAI methods, and qualitatively assessed them for congruency between simulated and clinical contours, and how much XAI agreed with expert reasoning. To objectify observations, we explored persistent homology intensity filtrations to capture essential topological characteristics of XAI attributions. Principal component (PC) eigenvalues of Euler characteristic profiles were correlated with spatial agreement (Dice-Sørensen similarity coefficient; DSC). Evaluation was done using sensitivity, specificity and the area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve on an external AAPM dataset, where as proof-of-principle, we regard the lowest 15% DSC as insufficient. Results: PatternNet attributions (PNet-A) focused on soft-tissue structures, whereas guided backpropagation (GBP) highlighted both soft-tissue and high-density structures (e.g. mandible bone), which was congruent with synthetic situations. Both methods typically had higher/denser activations in better auto-contoured medial and anterior lobes. Curated models produced “cleaner” gradient class-activation mapping (GCAM) attributions. Quantitative analysis showed that PCλ<inf>1</inf> of guided GCAM's (GGCAM) Euler characteristic (EC) profile had good predictive value (sensitivity>0.85, specificity>0.90) of DSC for AAPM cases, with AUROC = 0.66, 0.74, 0.94, 0.83 for GBP, GCAM, GGCAM and PNet-A. For for λ<inf>1</inf> < −1.8e3 of GGCAM's EC-profile, 87% of cases were insufficient. Conclusions: GBP and PNet-A qualitatively agreed most with expert reasoning on directly (structure borders) and indirectly (proxies used for identifying structure borders) important features for PG segmentation. Additionally, this work investigated as proof-of-principle how topological data analysis could be used for quantitative XAI signal analysis to a-priori mark potentially inadequate CNN-segmentations, using only features from inside the predicted PG. This work used PG as a well-understood segmentation paradigm and may extend to target volumes and other organs-at-risk. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper argues that explainability is only one facet of a broader ideal that shapes our expectations towards artificial intelligence (AI). Fundamentally, the issue is to what extent AI exhibits systematicity—not merely in being sensitive to how thoughts are composed of recombinable constituents, but in striving towards an integrated body of thought that is consistent, coherent, comprehensive, and parsimoniously principled. This richer conception of systematicity has been obscured by the long shadow of the “systematicity challenge” to connectionism, according to which network architectures are fundamentally at odds with what Fodor and colleagues termed “the systematicity of thought.” I offer a conceptual framework for thinking about “the systematicity of thought” that distinguishes four senses of the phrase. I use these distinctions to defuse the perceived tension between systematicity and connectionism and show that the conception of systematicity that historically shaped our sense of what makes thought rational, authoritative, and scientific is more demanding than the Fodorian notion. To determine whether we have reason to hold AI models to this ideal of systematicity, I then argue, we must look to the rationales for systematization and explore to what extent they transfer to AI models. I identify five such rationales and apply them to AI. This brings into view the “hard systematicity challenge.” However, the demand for systematization itself needs to be regulated by the rationales for systematization. This yields a dynamic understanding of the need to systematize thought, which tells us how systematic we need AI models to be and when. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study provides a comprehensive overview of the rapidly evolving environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risk field by integrating a bibliometric analysis with a systematic literature review (SLR). The bibliometric results reveal a sharp rise in scholarly output since 2020, driven by tighter sustainability regulations, growing investor scrutiny, and global disruptions such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Performance analysis highlights that Europe and North America, particularly Italy and the United States, lead in research productivity and citation impact, although collaboration remains fragmented. Science mapping identifies seven dominant thematic clusters, ranging from ESG risk integration in finance, controversies, and governance linkages to emerging data-driven and machine learning methods, which align closely with six core themes synthesized from the SLR. The qualitative synthesis of 26 influential studies confirms that ESG risk is a financially material factor influencing firm performance, audit quality, credit risk, and investment returns, but also exposes persistent challenges such as inconsistent measurement, limited causal testing, and underexplored contexts outside developed markets. The combined insights underline the need for harmonized ESG risk indicators, dynamic causal modeling, explainable AI, and cross-country comparative research. By bridging bibliometric structure and qualitative depth, this study offers an integrated foundation to guide future ESG risk scholarship and support more resilient, sustainable financial decision-making. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Explainable Artificial Intelligence (xAI) plays a crucial role in enhancing our understanding of decision-making processes within black-box Machine Learning models. Our objective is to introduce various xAI methodologies, providing risk managers with accessible approaches to model interpretation. To exemplify this, we present a case study focused on mitigating surrender risk in insurance savings products. We begin by using real data from universal life policies to build logistic regression and tree-based models. Using a range of xAI techniques, we gain valuable insight into the inner workings of tree-based models. We then propose a novel supervised clustering approach that integrates Shapley values with a Kohonen neural network (KNN). The process involves three main steps: computing Shapley values from a supervised tree-based model; clustering individuals into homogeneous profiles using an unsupervised KNN; and interpreting these profiles with a supervised decision tree model. Finally, we present several key findings derived from the application of xAI techniques, which have the potential to enhance surrender risk management practices. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study presents a Machine Learning (ML) framework for an Ahead-of-Time (AoT) prediction of production halts and defects in particleboard manufacturing that uses only pre-production input variables. The proposed approach incorporates both Single-Task Learning (STL) and Multi-Task Learning (MTL) paradigms, which are evaluated across three production lines under two modeling strategies: Line-Specific Modeling (LSM) and Line-Agnostic Modeling (LAM). The experimental evaluation benchmarks a lightweight Logistic Regression (LogR) model against three Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) techniques: H2O AutoML, Ludwig, and a Bayesian-optimized Deep Feedforward Network (DFFN). Results show that the STL-LSM combination using LogR achieves the highest overall predictive performance. To enhance model interpretability, we apply two model-agnostic eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques: SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and One-Dimensional Sensitivity Analysis (1DSA). These methods generate feature importance rankings across targets and production lines, which are evaluated using quantitative (normalized distance metrics) and qualitative measures (alignment with domain expert insights). The XAI findings reveal a strong consistency between SHAP and 1DSA, with 1DSA requiring a substantially lower computational cost. Moreover, the convergence between model-derived interpretations and expert feedback highlights the practical relevance of the proposed ML framework in supporting data-driven decision-making for particleboard production planning. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The quality and availability of water play a vital role in sustaining human life, driving economic growth, and maintaining public health and environmental balance. Moreover, the traditional methods of assessing water quality rely on costly and lengthy laboratory testing and statistical evaluations. Given the serious risks posed by poor water quality, there is an urgent need for faster and more economical assessment techniques. Therefore, precise forecasting of water quality parameters stands as a critical tool for enhancing both water resource management and efforts to combat contamination. To bridge these gaps, this study suggested multiple deep learning algorithms (LSTM, CNN, GRU, BiLSTM, BiGRU, and LSTM-CNN) to predict daily fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) concentrations. For a more accurate assessment, the results of the suggested models were compared with baseline models, including CART and MLR. The analysis incorporated using nine different scenarios from seven water quality parameters including discharge (Q), water temperature (T<inf>w</inf>), specific conductivity (SC), dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, turbidity (TU), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), and also, YY (year), MM (month), and DD (day), from two USGS monitoring stations (14211720 and 14203500) in Oregon, USA. In this study, the models' performance was evaluated using four metrics: root mean squared error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), correlation coefficient (R), and mean absolute error (MAE). Analyzing results from both stations, the hybrid LSTM-CNN model demonstrated superior FDOM prediction accuracy compared to standalone architectures (LSTM, CNN, GRU, BiLSTM, BiGRU). At USGS 14203500, LSTM-CNN achieved RMSE of 2.867 ppb QSE, MAE of 1.641 ppb QSE, and R of 0.965. For USGS 14211720, it yielded RMSE of 1.022 ppb QSE, MAE of 0.631 ppb QSE, and R of 0.989. Based on SHAP results, DO, pH, TU, and Chl-a were identified as the most important parameters for predicting FDOM in each model's performance. Finally, this study demonstrates that the hybrid LSTM-CNN approach effectively predicts FDOM concentrations, making it an efficient tool for water quality monitoring. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Simulating hydrology and water quality in karst regions remains a significant challenge due to the complex and unique geological conditions. This study developed a novel conceptual model integrating baseflow segmentation and rainfall-stormflow analysis for hydrological and water quality simulation and implemented it using an interpretable machine learning approach. Two representative watersheds in the karst region of southwestern China—the Chishui river and Nanpan river—were selected as case studies. The results demonstrated that (1) The proposed method successfully achieved comprehensive simulations of streamflow, COD<inf>Mn</inf>, TN, and TP. The maximum prediction time span was 3 days for streamflow (R2 > 0.60) and 2 days for COD<inf>Mn</inf>, TN, and TP (R2 > 0.59). (2) Rainfall plays a significant positive driving role in hydrological and water quality simulations, effectively weakening the strong autocorrelation of these parameters in karst regions. The increase of baseflow and stormflow worsens water quality, which is most significant for COD<inf>Mn</inf> and TP in Chishui river basin. (3) Water quality in ridge-furrow valleys, fractured basins, and fractured mountainous areas is more significantly influenced by rainfall due to the unique geological features. The proposed method can be effectively applied in karst areas with non-point source pollution and directly supports water environment prediction and identification of key pollution source areas. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have significantly enhanced the capabilities of autonomous systems in complex decision making within challenging built environments, particularly in urban search and rescue (USAR) operations, a critical component of postdisaster response. These operations require swift decision making to balance conflicting objectives, such as optimizing path planning while ensuring comprehensive environmental mapping. Current Explainable AI (XAI) approaches often focus on rationalizing or explaining the decision outcomes of AI agents but do not adequately address the methodologies needed to understand how AI systems adapt their belief systems based on real-time, limited local data, such as wind disturbances and obstacle distributions. This paper introduces an evidence accumulation model inspired by cognitive psychology, designed to estimate AI belief updates. Utilizing multiobjective reinforcement learning (MORL), this model trains drones in simulated urban settings characterized by dynamic wind fields. A reverse reasoning approach is then applied to interpret AI decisions using collected behavioral data and environmental observations. A comprehensive simulation study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of this model. The results demonstrate that the model effectively identifies how limited local information influences AI behavior after belief updates, offering a human cognitive analysis perspective to rationalize AI actions. This research contributes innovative methodologies for explaining the sophisticated cognitive flow of AI systems, laying the groundwork for improved human-AI alignment in postdisaster applications in urban settings. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In the field of intelligent manufacturing, leveraging acoustic emission (AE) technology for quality monitoring and assurance during laser manufacturing processes is paramount. Despite this, current monitoring techniques struggle to accurately characterize the time-frequency distribution and transient dynamics of AE signals, and there exists a paucity of neural network models tailored for these specific analytical tasks. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a cutting-edge monitoring approach that integrates a Bi-Differential Convolutional Network (BDCN) with a Frequency Bands Recalibration Spectrogram (FBRS). Firstly, a novel analytical technique employing FBRS for transient AE signals is introduced, which adaptively redistributes frequency resolution to highlight informative components within a constrained pixel space. The BDCN, a groundbreaking nonlinear network model, jointly performs directional feature processing and stress state classification by incorporating two specialized functional modules designed for horizontal and vertical differencing. The model emphasizes directional texture and gradient patterns while mitigating low-frequency feature loss through complementary enhancement strategies. The efficacy of the proposed methodology has been empirically confirmed through rigorous testing on aluminum alloy 7075 and titanium alloy TC4. When juxtaposed with state-of-the-art networks, the presented monitoring strategy exhibits enhanced discriminative precision and robustness, signifying its potential in the domain of intelligent manufacturing quality assurance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Hypertension is a significant global health challenge, contributing substantially to morbidity and mortality through its association with various cardiovascular diseases. Traditional approaches to hypertension risk prediction, which rely on broad epidemiological data and common risk factors, often fail to account for individual variability, highlighting the need for advanced data-driven methodologies. This review examines the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in enhancing the prediction of hypertension risk by incorporating a range of data sources, including clinical, lifestyle, and genetic factors. Despite promising developments, challenges such as data standardisation, the need for high-quality datasets, model explainability, and class imbalance in medical data persist. The integration of wearable technologies, alongside the potential of emerging technologies in healthcare such as digital twins, presents significant opportunities in personalising care through the dynamic modelling of individual health profiles. This review synthesises current methodologies, identifies existing gaps, and highlights the transformative potential of AI-driven, personalised hypertension prevention and management, emphasising the importance of addressing issues of reproducibility and transparency to facilitate clinical adoption. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding the relationship between the audiovisual environment of streets and cycling behavior is crucial for designing more inclusive and responsive transport environments. However, most previous studies have concentrated on the macro-level aspects of the built environment, such as land-use mix, while overlooking the street-space quality characteristics that influence cyclists’ on-site perceptions. Although research has explored the role of objective visual features, studies on the audiovisual environment of streets and its perceived impact remain scarce. This study combines street view imagery, Strava Heatmap data, and interpretable machine learning to investigate the nonlinear and interactive effects of street-level spatial quality on cycling volumes. The results indicate that (1) auditory characteristics—especially noise intensity and sound quality—exert a significant and often stronger influence on cycling volume than visual features alone, challenging visual-centric planning assumptions; (2) several spatial features show nonlinear or threshold effects (e.g., green view index and soundscape eventfulness exhibit inverted U-shaped curves), indicating that excessive environmental richness may reduce cycling appeal (3) synergistic and antagonistic interactions exist between visual and auditory elements—for instance, natural sounds can mitigate the negative impact of high noise, while enclosed visual environments amplify it. These findings provide empirical evidence that optimizing—rather than maximizing—street-level sensory stimuli is essential for promoting active travel. Building on this insight, our study offers practical guidance for policymakers and urban designers to implement more targeted and context-sensitive interventions, and underscores the potential of integrating audiovisual design into sustainable transport planning. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study proposes a novel explainable risk assessment framework that integrates the fuzzy Full Consistency Method (FUCOM), fuzzy VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR)-Sort, and fuzzy linguistic summarization to address the challenges of uncertainty, prioritization, and interpretability in risk evaluation. The model enables multi-criteria analysis under linguistic uncertainty, classifies risks into predefined categories, and generates human-readable linguistic summaries to support decision-makers. The proposed methodology is applied to a real-world construction case involving 32 risk items, which are categorized into high, medium, and low risk groups. Comparative analysis with six established multiple criteria sorting algorithms reveals strong alignment in classification outcomes. The novelty of the proposed model lies in enhancing the explainability of multiple criteria sorting algorithms by integrating fuzzy linguistic summarization into the classification process—an aspect largely overlooked in the existing literature. The results demonstrate that the proposed model not only produces consistent risk classifications across alternative methods but also enhances decision-makers’ understanding through interpretable linguistic outputs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Machine learning algorithms have shown promise in reducing bias in wind gust predictions, while still underpredicting high gusts. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) supports this issue by identifying when predictions are reliable or need cautious interpretation. Using data from 61 extratropical storms in the Northeastern USA, we introduce evidential neural network (ENN) as a novel approach for UQ in gust predictions, leveraging atmospheric variables from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Explainable AI techniques suggested that key predictive features contributed to higher uncertainty, which correlated strongly with storm intensity and spatial gust gradients. Compared to WRF, ENN demonstrated a 47 % reduction in RMSE and allowed the construction of gust prediction intervals without an ensemble, successfully capturing at least 95 % of observed gusts at 179 out of 266 stations. From an operational perspective, providing gust forecasts with quantified uncertainty enhances stakeholders’ confidence in risk assessment and response planning for extreme gust events. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study focuses on artificial intelligence-driven classification of glioma and Ki-67 leveling using T2w-FLAIR MRI, exploring the association of Ki-67 biomarkers with deep learning (DL) features through explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). This IRB-approved study included 101 patients with glioma brain tumor acquired MR images with the T2W-FLAIR sequence. We extracted DL bottleneck features using ResNet50 from glioma MR images. Principal component analysis (PCA) was deployed for dimensionality reduction. XAI was used to identify potential features. The XGBosst classified the histologic grades of the glioma and the level of Ki-67. We integrated potential DL features with patient demographics (age and sex) and Ki-67 biomarkers, utilizing SHAP to determine the model's essential features and interactions. Glioma grade classification and Ki-67 level predictions achieved overall accuracies of 0.94 and 0.91, respectively. It achieved precision scores of 0.92, 0.94, and 0.96 for glioma grades 2, 3, and 4, and 0.88, 0.94, and 0.97 for Ki-67 levels (low: 5%≤Ki−67<10%, moderate: 10%≤Ki−67≤20, and high: Ki−67>20%). Corresponding F1-scores were 0.95, 0.88, and 0.96 for glioma grades and 0.92, 0.93, and 0.87 for Ki-67 levels. SHAP analysis further highlighted a strong association between bottleneck DL features and Ki-67 biomarkers, demonstrating their potential to differentiate glioma grades and Ki-67 levels while offering valuable insights into glioma aggressiveness. This study demonstrates the precise classification of glioma grades and the prediction of Ki-67 levels to underscore the potential of AI-driven MRI analysis to enhance clinical decision-making in glioma management. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study proposes a theoretical framework for dynamic destination competitiveness (DD-TDC) by integrating digital empowerment and dynamic governance mechanisms. Using data on the competitiveness of 119 destinations from the World Economic Forum (2018–2023), the Interpretable Random Forest Model and SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis was conducted to explore the drivers of competitiveness during crisis and non-crisis periods. The findings reveal that (1) Policy factors exhibit a short-term dominant effect on competitiveness through dynamic governance mechanisms during the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) in the long term, infrastructure is the most significant driver of competitiveness, followed by tourism resources and the business environment, while policy and sustainability contribute relatively less; and (3) the long-term impact of COVID-19 on destination competitiveness is limited. This study validates the dynamic adaptability of the DD-TDC model and provides methodological insights for destination managers to address crises and build sustainable competitiveness. The results have valuable implications for both academic research and practical destination management strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Sugarcane is a vital agricultural crop in Brazil, playing a crucial role in both the national economy and bioenergy production. To enhance productivity and operational efficiency across the sugarcane production chain, the adoption of advanced technologies, such as machine learning (ML) algorithms, has become increasingly essential. This study aims to assess the current state of scientific research on the application of ML algorithms in Brazilian sugarcane cultivation through a comprehensive review of national and international publications. The findings reveal a predominance of supervised learning algorithms, particularly Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and Artificial Neural Networks. In contrast, unsupervised learning methods have been applied less frequently, while reinforcement learning techniques are notably absent from the reviewed studies. The analysis also highlights significant regional disparities, with a strong concentration of research in the Southeast region, Brazil’s primary sugarcane-producing area. Meanwhile, the North region—despite its considerable potential for expansion—exhibits limited research activity. This review underscores the need to explore underutilized ML approaches, such as semi-supervised and reinforcement learning, to better address data scarcity and the complexities of dynamic agricultural management. Additionally, the incorporation of Explainable Artificial Intelligence techniques, such as SHAP and LIME, is recommended to enhance model transparency and interpretability for decision-makers. These findings highlight the importance of expanding both methodological diversity and geographical coverage in Brazilian sugarcane research while encouraging the integration of emerging ML techniques to foster sustainable agricultural practices and improve crop productivity. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study developed explainable machine learning (ML) models to enhance outdoor thermal comfort (OTC) prediction in traditional villages, aiming to improve resident health and rural tourism. A village-specific OTC dataset was established through field experiments, and eight ML algorithms were utilized to predict thermal sensation (TSV), comfort (TCV), and acceptance (TAV) votes, with performance compared to empirical and mechanism models. Feature engineering, data resampling, and hyperparameter optimization were applied to optimize ML models, while the Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) framework with dataset segmentation addressed explainability challenges. Results demonstrated that: (1) ML models, particularly XGBoost (XGB), outperformed empirical and mechanism models in TSV predictions. (2) Feature engineering and Bayesian optimization achieved maximum accuracy improvement of 13.6 % and 4.8 %, respectively, while SMOTE resampling enhanced the prediction of minority classes. (3) Meteorological impacts on TSV, TCV, and TAV exhibited seasonal variations, with air temperature (Ta) dominating in summer and global radiation (G) prevailing in winter. Non-meteorological factors, including individual and psychological characteristics, showed divergent adaptation between tourists and residents. These findings offer valuable insights for optimizing village layouts and tourism schedules while advancing data-driven OTC management frameworks. This study bridges ML applications with traditional village sustainability, offering a foundation for intelligent built-environment science. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

This study aims to predict the compressive strength of RA-SCC by using five interpretable machine learning (ML) methods including M5P model tree, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). To develop the ML models, a dataset containing 454 samples was constructed, encompassing experimental data with varying material dosages, curing ages, and recycled aggregate properties. The hyperparameters were optimized using Bayesian optimization and 10-fold cross-validation. Additionally, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was employed to assess the importance and contributions of the input parameters affecting compressive strength. The results indicated that the XGBoost model achieved the highest accuracy among the tested models, with R2 = 0.909, RMSE = 4.99 MPa, and MAE = 3.54 MPa. SHAP analysis revealed that cement content and age were the most influential factors positively affecting compressive strength predictions, while fly ash and recycled concrete aggregate content exhibited the highest negative effects. The ML models proposed in this study provide a systematic evaluation of the compressive strength predictions for RA-SCC and offer valuable insights for concrete mix design and quality control. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Accurately predicting the energy use intensity (EUI) of office buildings is essential for optimizing energy efficiency and implementing sustainable building practices. This study integrated green building information modelling (green BIM) with advanced machine learning (ML) techniques to develop EUI prediction models tailored to Taiwanese office buildings. A data set of 1006 unique BIM models was generated using Green Building Studio, which calculated the EUI for diverse configurations of architectural and environmental variables. The forensic-based investigation algorithm was employed for hyperparameter optimization, and it considerably enhanced the performance of the developed boosting-based ensemble models. Of all models, XGBoost exhibited the highest accuracy and robustness, achieving the lowest root-mean-square error (37.98 ± 11.81 MJ/m2/year) and mean absolute percentage error (1.86 % ± 0.50 %) for the test set, thereby outperforming the random forest, bagging, and adaptive weighted blended ensemble models. Feature importance analysis, conducted using the SHapley Additive exPlanations technique, revealed that the number of stories, geographical location, and floor area are the factors most strongly affecting EUI, consistent with real-world expectations. Overall, this study highlights the effectiveness of combining green-BIM-driven simulations, advanced ML models, and interpretability techniques to address energy efficiency challenges in office buildings. The findings provide actionable insights for architects, engineers, and policymakers seeking to design energy-efficient buildings and implement targeted energy-saving strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Fire safety is a primary concern in safeguarding lives and property. However, it is challenging to predict fire incidents and identify potential influencing factors due to limitations of data, model accuracy and interpretability. This paper proposes a novel scheme designed to enhance predictive and explainable capabilities by integrating multi-source data, adaptive machine learning methods, and Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) tools for more effective and applicable fire safety management. The scheme shows satisfactory prediction results by leveraging the data from grid-style management systems and our proposed machine learning method with dynamic time warping distance-based time series clustering, significantly outperforming the methods merely based on time series modeling. Moreover, clustered features help to clarify the main influencing risk factors and provide clearer insights for model interpretability. With global SHAP, community clusters capturing community fire event frequency, as well as historical records on fire police rescue, smoke alarms, and fire alarms, are found to be significant risk factors among all the features over the whole communities and periods via the model interpretability analysis, implying that communities where fires used to occur frequently are more likely to occur in future, which should be highly vigilant in real fire management. With local SHAP, specific risk factors that vary across communities can be identified for any single community with a given period. We demonstrate the potential of this integrated machine learning scheme in improving the prediction accuracy and risk identification applicability of fire incidents, which contributes to more effective and customized fire safety management. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Research on corporate failure prediction is focused on increasing the model’s statistical accuracy, most recently via the introduction of a variety of machine learning (ML)-based models, often overlooking the practical appeal and potential adoption barriers in the context of corporate management. This literature review compares ML models with the classic, widely accepted Altman Z-score through a technology adoption lens. We map how technological features, organizational readiness, environmental pressure and user perceptions shape adoption using an integrated technology adoption framework that combines the Technology–Organization–Environment framework with the Technology Acceptance Model. The analysis shows that Z-score models offer simplicity, interpretability and low cost, suiting firms with limited analytical resources, whereas ML models deliver superior accuracy and adaptability but require advanced data infrastructure, specialized expertise and regulatory clarity. By linking the models’ characteristics with adoption determinants, the study clarifies when each model is most appropriate and sets a research agenda for long-horizon forecasting, explainable artificial intelligence and context-specific model design. These insights help managers choose failure prediction tools that fit their strategic objectives and implementation capacity. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Urban building energy retrofit (UBER) is a critical strategy for advancing the low-carbon and climate-resilience transformation of cities. The integration of machine learning (ML), data-driven clustering, and multi-objective optimization (MOO) is a key aspect of artificial intelligence (AI) that is transforming the process of retrofit decision-making. This integration enables the development of scalable, cost-effective, and robust solutions on an urban scale. This systematic review synthesizes recent advances in AI-driven MOO frameworks for UBER, focusing on how state-of-the-art methods can help to identify and prioritize retrofit targets, balance energy, cost, and environmental objectives, and develop transparent, stakeholder-oriented decision-making processes. Key advances highlighted in this review include the following: (1) the application of ML-based surrogate models for efficient evaluation of retrofit design alternatives; (2) data-driven clustering and classification to identify high-impact interventions across complex urban fabrics; (3) MOO algorithms that support trade-off analysis under real-world constraints; and (4) the emerging integration of explainable AI (XAI) for enhanced transparency and stakeholder engagement in retrofit planning. Representative case studies demonstrate the practical impact of these approaches in optimizing envelope upgrades, active system retrofits, and prioritization schemes. Notwithstanding these advancements, considerable challenges persist, encompassing data heterogeneity, the transferability of models across disparate urban contexts, fragmented digital toolchains, and the paucity of real-world validation of AI-based solutions. The subsequent discussion encompasses prospective research directions, with particular emphasis on the potential of deep learning (DL), spatiotemporal forecasting, generative models, and digital twins to further advance scalable and adaptive urban retrofit. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Non-destructive concrete strength prediction faces limitations in validation scope, methodological comparison, and interpretability that constrain deployment in safety-critical construction applications. This study presents a machine learning framework integrating polynomial feature engineering, AdaBoost ensemble regression, and Bayesian optimization to achieve both predictive accuracy and physics-consistent interpretability. Eight state-of-the-art methods were evaluated across 4420 concrete samples, including statistical significance testing, scenario-based assessment, and robustness analysis under measurement uncertainty. The proposed PolyBayes-ABR methodology achieves R2 = 0.9957 (RMSE = 0.643 MPa), showing statistical equivalence to leading ensemble methods, including XGBoost (p = 0.734) and Random Forest (p = 0.888), while outperforming traditional approaches (p < 0.001). Scenario-based validation across four engineering applications confirms robust performance (R2 > 0.93 in all cases). SHAP analysis reveals that polynomial features capture physics-consistent interactions, with the Curing_age × Er interaction achieving dominant importance (SHAP value: 4.2337), aligning with established hydration–microstructure relationships. When accuracy differences fall within measurement uncertainty ranges, the framework provides practical advantages through enhanced uncertainty quantification (±1.260 MPa vs. ±1.338 MPa baseline) and actionable engineering insights for quality control and mix design optimization. This approach addresses the interpretability challenge in concrete engineering applications where both predictive performance and scientific understanding are essential for safe deployment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The increasing complexity of manufacturing processes demands accurate defect prediction and interpretable insights into the causes of quality issues. This study proposes a methodology integrating machine learning, clustering, and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to support defect analysis and quality control in industrial environments. Using a dataset based on empirical industrial distributions, we train an XGBoost model to classify high- and low-defect scenarios from multidimensional production and quality metrics. The model demonstrates high predictive performance and is analyzed using five XAI techniques (SHAP, LIME, ELI5, PDP, and ICE) to identify the most influential variables linked to defective outcomes. In parallel, we apply Fuzzy C-Means and K-means to segment production data into latent operational profiles, which are also interpreted using XAI to uncover process-level patterns. This approach provides both global and local interpretability, revealing consistent variables across predictive and structural perspectives. After a thorough review, no prior studies have combined supervised learning, unsupervised clustering, and XAI within a unified framework for manufacturing defect analysis. The results demonstrate that this integration enables a transparent, data-driven understanding of production dynamics. The proposed hybrid approach supports the development of intelligent, explainable Industry 4.0 systems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding the carbon emissions of multimodal travel—comprising walking, metro, bus, cycling, and ride-hailing—is essential for promoting sustainable urban mobility. However, most existing studies focus on single-mode travel, while underlying spatiotemporal and behavioral determinants remain insufficiently explored due to the lack of fine-grained data and interpretable analytical frameworks. This study proposes a novel integration of high-frequency, real-world mobility trajectory data with interpretable machine learning to systematically identify the key drivers of carbon emissions at the individual trip level. Firstly, multimodal travel chains are reconstructed using continuous GPS trajectory data collected in Beijing. Secondly, a model based on Calculate Emissions from Road Transport (COPERT) is developed to quantify trip-level CO<inf>2</inf> emissions. Thirdly, four interpretable machine learning models based on gradient boosting—XGBoost, GBDT, LightGBM, and CatBoost—are trained using transportation and built environment features to model the relationship between CO<inf>2</inf> emissions and a set of explanatory variables; finally, Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and partial dependence plots (PDPs) are used to interpret the model outputs, revealing key determinants and their non-linear interaction effects. The results show that transportation-related features account for 75.1% of the explained variance in emissions, with bus usage being the most influential single factor (contributing 22.6%). Built environment features explain the remaining 24.9%. The PDP analysis reveals that substantial emission reductions occur only when the shares of bus, metro, and cycling surpass threshold levels of approximately 40%, 40%, and 30%, respectively. Additionally, travel carbon emissions are minimized when trip origins and destinations are located within a 10 to 11 km radius of the central business district (CBD). This study advances the field by establishing a scalable, interpretable, and behaviorally grounded framework to assess carbon emissions from multimodal travel, providing actionable insights for low-carbon transport planning and policy design. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Medical imaging is vital for diagnosing and treating colorectal cancer (CRC), a leading cause of mortality. Classifying colorectal polyps and CRC precursors remains challenging due to operator variability and expertise dependence. Deep learning (DL) models show promise in polyp classification but face adoption barriers due to their ‘black box’ nature, limiting interpretability. This study presents an example-based explainable artificial intehlligence (XAI) approach using Pix2Pix to generate synthetic polyp images with controlled size variations and LIME to explain classifier predictions visually. EfficientNet and Vision Transformer (ViT) were trained on datasets of real and synthetic images, achieving strong baseline accuracies of 94% and 96%, respectively. Image quality was assessed using PSNR (18.04), SSIM (0.64), and FID (123.32), while classifier robustness was evaluated across polyp sizes. Results show that Pix2Pix effectively controls image attributes like polyp size despite limitations in visual fidelity. LIME integration revealed classifier vulnerabilities, underscoring the value of complementary XAI techniques. This enhances DL model interpretability and deepens understanding of their behaviour. The findings contribute to developing explainable AI tools for polyp classification and CRC diagnosis. Future work will improve synthetic image quality and refine XAI methodologies for broader clinical use. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The relationship between a reservoir network structure and the overall performance of a reservoir computer remains an unanswered question, particularly when searching for an optimal yet small network. In this study, we introduce a systematic, task-specific node-pruning framework that enhances the efficiency while decreasing the size of the reservoir networks. We demonstrate that large networks can be compressed while preserving—or even improving—performance by node removal. Our findings reveal the emergence of optimal subnetwork structures from larger Erdös-Rényi random networks, indicating that efficiency is governed not merely by size but by topological organization. We observe that the pruning process enhances the reservoir’s structural efficiency by forming a self-organized asymmetric distribution of input-receiving and readout nodes, with significant changes in key graph-theoretic measures, such as consistent decreases in spectral radius and average degree. Interestingly, the best-performing pruned networks exhibited significantly lower linear memory capacities over the initial networks, which often did not align with the memory demands of the respective tasks. We show that pruning leads to non-uniform network refinements, where specific nodes and connectivity patterns become critical for information flow and task-specific memory retention. This work offers fundamental insights into how structural optimization influences reservoir dynamics, providing a pathway toward designing more efficient, scalable, and interpretable machine learning architectures. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Adding basalt fibre to concrete has become a promising way to improve its strength under different loading conditions. Predicting the strength of basalt fibre reinforced concrete (BFRC) is more complex than for conventional concrete. Traditional methods rely on iterative experiments to understand the underlying behaviour. This study applies machine learning (ML) models, paired with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), to predict the compressive, flexural, and tensile strengths of BFRC efficiently and transparently. Three datasets, each with 267 samples, were used for model development. Each sample included 10 features: cement, fly ash, silica ash, coarse aggregate, fine aggregate, water, superplasticiser, fibre diameter, fibre length, and fibre content. Three ML models, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and decision tree (DT), were evaluated. RF achieved the highest accuracy for compressive (R2 = 0.926, MSE = 9.4, MAE = 2.3) and flexural strength (R2 = 0.882, MSE = 0.5, MAE = 0.5), while DT performed best for tensile strength (R2 = 0.935, MSE = 0.2, MAE = 0.3). Shapley additive explanation (SHAP)-based explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods revealed key predictors: fine aggregate for compressive strength, fibre diameter for tensile strength, and silica ash for flexural strength. Also, the authors developed a web-based online application to predict the strength (compressive, flexural and tensile) to improve the accessibility and usability of the findings. This approach offers a practical alternative to experimental testing and contributes to a better understanding of BFRC behaviour. It holds strong potential for adoption in the construction industry. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Employee attrition refers to the phenomenon of employees leaving an organization. High attrition rates can have a profoundly adverse impact on organizations, resulting in the loss of talent, reduced productivity, increased recruitment costs, and a negative effect on employee morale and confidence. This paper presents a novel model for predicting employee attrition by leveraging the synergistic combination of the Stacked Classifier model and Explainable AI techniques. By combining diverse machine learning algorithms into an ensemble model and leveraging XAI methods, this study not only forecasts attrition with precision but also explains the underlying decision-making process, making the predictions interpretable and actionable. The proposed model yields an accuracy of 98.8%, a precision of 98.1%, and an F1-score of 98.5%. The outcomes indicate that job satisfaction, salary, and career development opportunities have a significant impact on attrition rates. The proposed model can help organizations develop targeted employee retention strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The exponential growth of online shopping and other digital payment methods has led to a meteoric rise in the use of credit cards. Analyzing consumer data for the purpose of detecting and preventing fraud has been greatly facilitated by machine learning (ML). But most real-world credit card data have irrelevant and redundant features, which makes ML classifiers not work as well. In this research paper, a new approach for detecting and managing risk and segmenting customers in financial systems is introduced, called RiskNet. The proposed approach consists of three main modules, which are (i) data preprocessing module (DPM), (ii) feature selection module (FSM), and (iii) risk predictive module. For the first module (e.g., DPM), the input data are cleaned and preprocessed to be suitable for the next module. Next, during the second module (e.g., FSM) the most important and effective features are selected using the proposed feature selection method called improved whale optimization algorithm. Then, these features are fed to the used classifiers to detect credit card fraud. Finally, to assess the efficacy of RiskNet, experiments were conducted on a real-world financial dataset, and the results demonstrated that RiskNet outperforms existing state of the art. RiskNet delivers precise risk predictions and personalized risk management strategies for each customer, enhancing the overall stability of the financial system. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents a novel Mixture of Experts (MoE)-based framework designed to enhance clinical decision-making by balancing predictive accuracy, interpretability, and adaptability. Our approach relies on a set of locally specialized logistic regression models, dynamically selecting the most suitable expert for each instance based on local feature patterns. To enforce sparsity in both the gating mechanism and expert models, we employ the Gumbel-softmax relaxation, enabling end-to-end differentiable selection of both the active expert and the most relevant features for each prediction. By integrating this mechanism, our method improves computational efficiency and generalization while maintaining instance-level interpretability. Unlike black-box models that require post hoc explanation techniques, our solution provides transparency by construction, offering direct insights into feature contributions for each decision. We evaluated our approach on multiple real-world healthcare datasets, spanning both standard clinical classification tasks and process-oriented predictive scenarios. Experimental results demonstrated that our MoE-based framework achieves robust and competitive performance while maintaining lower complexity than black-box methods such as XGBoost and Random Forest and improving generalization over simpler interpretable models, including Decision Trees, Linear Trees, and standard Logistic Regressors. Additionally, our analysis of the trade-off between model complexity and predictive performance shows that our method delivers stable and reliable results across diverse datasets and evaluation metrics. These findings underscore the advantages of an interpretable MoE-based approach in clinical AI, supporting transparent and accountable decision-making. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Tomato diseases significantly impact agricultural productivity, leading to economic losses and reduced quality of crops. Given the importance of tomatoes as a major food source, timely and accurate disease detection is crucial. Traditional manual inspection is error-prone and impracti cal for large-scale farming. This study aims to enhance the accuracy and transparency of tomato leaf disease detection through deep learning techniques. A dataset of 523 images collected from Walkait Setit Humera Zone, with four irrigation sites, was augmented to 3138 images using basic preprocessing methods to improve quality. The dataset was split into training, validation, and testing sets in a 70 %, 10 %, and 20 % ratio. Pre-trained CNN architectures, including Mo bileNetV3, InceptionV3, and DenseNet201, were fine-tuned and implemented on Google Colab with GPU processing for disease detection. Explainable AI methods were employed to increase trust and model transparency. The DenseNet201 model, after fine-tuning, achieved the high est performance with 100 accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This research significantly improves crop production and food security by providing an efficient, accurate, and computa tionally feasible solution for detecting tomato leaf diseases, thereby supporting the sustainable growth of agricultural practices. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study examines factors beyond macroscale built environments (BE) influencing cycling behavior, integrating both microscale visual and auditory perceptions, especially soundscapes, while their impacts on cycling have not been explicitly investigated. Leveraging massive bikeshare trip data in Shenzhen, China, this study employs spatial explainable machine learning to uncover the associations among these three dimensions and cycling behavior using a multi-scale analytical framework. The results show that: (1) Macroscale BE remains dominant, while micro-scale soundscapes outweigh visual perceptions in explaining cycling usage. (2) Both perceived streetscape and soundscape indicators exhibit significant nonlinear effects on cycling behavior. (3) Synergistic interactions between visual streetscape and soundscape are observed, where maintaining audio-visual consistency (e.g., high perceived safety with high natural sounds perception) can positively affect cycling more substantially. Our findings encourage planners to prioritize strategic micro-level modifications targeting perceived street visual and auditory aspects over conventional macroscale BE interventions as cost-effective alternatives. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The rise in extreme heat events has made urban thermal environments a significant constraint on Bike-Sharing Systems (BSS). While many studies have explored the Built Environment (BE) and climate change's impact on Bike-Sharing Usage (BSU), urban thermal environments remain underexplored. This study uses the XGBoost model and SHAP analysis to examine how thermal and other urban environmental factors influence BSU under extreme heat, incorporating dynamic mean radiant temperature (T<inf>mrt</inf>) to capture the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of perceived thermal environments. The findings highlight the crucial role of the urban thermal environment in predicting BSU during non-peak daytime hours. Interactions between T<inf>mrt</inf> and factors like POI diversity, bus station distance, and other factors vary across time periods. Clustering and heat risk overlay analysis reveal differing resident decisions to “endure” or “avoid” heat risks, offering insights for designing more climate-resilient BSS and enhancing urban mobility strategies under extreme heat conditions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In high-stakes project risk assessment, balancing predictive accuracy with interpretability is critical to fostering stakeholder trust and supporting well-informed decision-making. This study presents the Interpretable Risk Assessment Framework with Belief Rule-Based Systems (IRAF-BRB), an Explainable AI (XAI) framework specifically designed to improve transparency, accountability, and accuracy in risk assessment. IRAF-BRB combines Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) to map and analyze interdependencies among risk factors with an optimized Belief Rule-Based (BRB) model. A modified Differential Evolution Covariance Matrix Self-Adaptation (DECMSA) algorithm is employed to enhance the predictive power of the BRB model while preserving interpretability, ensuring that stakeholders can both trust and understand the model's outputs. By transforming complex risk data into intuitive visualizations, the IRAF-BRB framework enables project managers to identify key risk drivers and anticipate cascading effects, leading to proactive risk mitigation. Experimental results demonstrate that IRAF-BRB reduces Mean Squared Error (MSE) to 4.09e−4 in predicting risk levels for high-rise construction projects, outperforming traditional BRB models such as Differential Evolution-based BRB (DE-BRB) (8.29e−4) and Particle Swarm Optimization-based BRB (PSO-BRB) (2.53e−3). The statistical significance of these results was confirmed via a two-sample t-test (p<0.05), establishing IRAF-BRB as a reliable and effective tool for accurate and interpretable risk assessment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques were applied to identify the most important factors influencing crop yield prediction, with a focus on strategies for sustainable agriculture. Using permutation importance and residual plot analysis, the results showed that nitrogen (N) content, Bandera variety and potassium oxide (K<inf>2</inf>O) are the most important traits influencing yield prediction. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) was used to predict yield using a large Moroccan national cereal dataset spanning 3 seasons. Residual Plots Analysis, Partial Dependent Plots (PDP), Permutation Importance (PI) and SHapley Additive ExPlanations (SHap) were used to select the features that influence yield prediction. The results indicate that optimizing soil nitrogen and potassium oxide levels together with strategic selection of crop varieties can significantly increase productivity. Residual analysis of the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) model confirmed its high predictive accuracy. This study underlines the value of XAI methods in improving the interpretability of predictive models. The insights gained can contribute to better soil management and informed crop selection, ultimately reducing yield losses under environmental stress. By increasing the resilience of agricultural systems, we aim to contribute to sustainable and data-driven farming practices and, in particular, address some of Morocco's unique agricultural challenges. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The urgent push for decarbonisation demands innovative, transparent methods to analyse and track decarbonisation strategies. This study addresses the problem of modelling energy consumption patterns at both building and district scales, ensuring transparency and scalability. By integrating well-established measurement and verification (M&V) techniques with interpretable data-driven modelling strategies, the research proposes a modelling workflow to track energy performance on a dynamic basis. The methods makes use of readily available metering data for electricity, district heating, and natural gas across a district, collected within a digital platform. A multi-resolution modelling approach is employed, with data at monthly, daily, and hourly intervals, that pinpoints anomalies and is meant to support a continuous refinement of operational strategies and efficiency measures. The Highfield Campus at the University of Southampton serves as the case study, illustrating how scalable, interpretable data-driven models can identify performance deviations and inform both short-term facilities management and long-term decarbonisation strategies. Findings reveal that simple and interpretable regression models can identify substantial variations in energy consumption pattern over longer time frames (ranging from months to years), whereas high-resolution analyses enhance the comprehension of dynamic operational patterns (days to hours). Both objectives can be achieved while maintaining a level of continuity in the modelling process, progressing from basic to detailed models while retaining interpretability. Further research will refine these models through additional physics-based constraints and explore deeper integrations with digital energy management platforms, offering replicable insights for broader district and urban-scale applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study explores the application of interpretable machine learning (ML) models for accurately estimating excavation and installation costs associated with underground high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipeline projects. Leveraging design data from seven projects across Asia, the research evaluates six regression models: linear regression, lasso regression, elastic net regression, random forest regression, XGBoost, and Gaussian process regression. Model performance was assessed using the R-squared (R2) metric, with XGBoost and Gaussian process regression achieving the highest R2 scores (above 0.89) on the testing data sets. Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) analysis reveals that pipe length, diameter, and depth are the most significant predictors, with pipe length contributing most substantially to cost estimations. The results indicate that ML models, particularly XGBoost and Gaussian process regression and stacked models, provide reliable cost predictions when diverse, high-quality data are available, offering a valuable tool for early-stage project budgeting and planning in the pipeline industry. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Facilities Management (FM) has grown significantly, driven by the pursuit of resource optimization, automation, and operational efficiency. However, specialized literature remains in an early stage, hindering a comprehensive understanding of the Critical Success Factors (CSFs) that influence the adoption of this technology in the sector. To address this gap, this study conducts a Second-Order Systematic Review (SOSR) to identify and consolidate the main CSFs associated with the adoption of AI in FM. The analysis is grounded in a conceptual model based on the TOEH theoretical framework (Technology–Organization–Environment–Human), which enables a multidimensional reading of both facilitators and barriers. Key challenges include system interoperability, data quality, the reliability of AI models, and building typology diversity, issues exacerbated by technological fragmentation and a lack of standardization, which hinder integrated solutions. Regulatory concerns regarding data privacy and governance, combined with limited workforce training, further hinder large-scale adoption. Conversely, innovations such as digital twins, explainable AI, robotics, and cybersecurity for smart buildings emerge as drivers of transformation. The findings provide valuable insights for FM managers, technology providers, and policymakers, contributing to the development of effective strategies for integrating AI in the Facilities Management sector. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding the interplay between building heights (BH) and urban heat island (UHI) effects is critical for mitigating urban warming, particularly as high-rise construction accelerates globally in response to land scarcity and population growth. While prior studies have examined BH-UHI linkages at regional or city levels, systematic comparisons across global cities remain limited by inconsistent methodologies. To address this gap, we employed the standardized local climate zone (LCZ) scheme and analyzed surface UHI intensity (SUHII) across 2851 cities worldwide by integrating satellite-derived land surface temperature, building height datasets, and an interpretable machine learning approach. Our results reveal a global daytime SUHII of 0.26 ± 0.73 °C (2001–2020), highlighting substantial urban warming with pronounced spatial heterogeneity. Open built LCZs matched the global SUHII average, while sparse/industrial built LCZs exceeded it, and compact built LCZs tripled this baseline. Notably, BH interactions dominated over direct contributions on SUHII in most built LCZs, with low-rise plots (LCZ 6 and LCZ 8) showing heightened thermal vulnerability. Geospatial analysis further identified amplified BH-driven SUHII impacts in low-rise plots within hotter climates, megacities, and lower-income regions. These findings underscore the imperative to prioritize spatial optimization of low-rise developments and increase vegetation to counteract BH-induced heat risks. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Global urbanization has exacerbated the heat island effect and carbon emissions, and urban and rural blue-green landscapes are critical for mitigating climate change. Traditional research has overlooked the non-linear mechanisms of the trade-off between carbon sinks and heat island effects, as well as heterogeneous landscape assemblages. Using the Harbin-Changchun Urban Agglomeration in China as an illustration, this investigation integrates a self-organized mapping model and an interpretable machine learning method to establish a characterization framework for blue-green landscape assemblages. The objective is to quantify the response mechanisms and nonlinear thresholds of net primary productivity (NPP) of vegetation, land surface temperature (LST), and their trade-offs. The findings demonstrated that (1) a total of seven types of blue-green landscape combination patterns were identified, with woodland-aggregated landscapes being the dominant type, which could achieve high NPP with low LST. (2) The thresholds of forested land percentage (FP), vegetation cover (FVC), and elevation coefficient of variation (ECV) were the primary factors influencing NPP, while FVC was more influential in regulating the marginal effect of LST. (3) Enhancing carbon sinks and regulating surface temperature can be achieved by maintaining FP within the range of 0.5–0.75. The lowest trade-off between NPP and LST can be achieved by setting FVC to 0.6. (4) It is imperative to prevent the functional attenuation that is caused by inefficient combinations of indicators and extreme threshold intervals, as NPP, LST, and their trade-offs are subject to the comprehensive influence of the interaction of multiple indicators. This study identified fine control thresholds for blue-green landscapes that are based on the characteristics of the landscape assemblage. These thresholds can serve as a spatial decision-making foundation for the mitigation of urban heat islands and the attainment of carbon neutrality standards. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

Laboratory testing is constrained by the limited availability of lunar soil samples and the challenges in simulating lunar environmental conditions, while in-situ testing on the lunar surface remains prohibitively costly. Satellite observations, though useful, introduce significant uncertainties. Therefore, utilizing existing data to uncover commonalities and predict the shear strength parameters of lunar soil is increasingly vital. This paper presents a machine learning-based approach to improve the prediction efficiency of ϕ and c. A comprehensive dataset was constructed from lunar soil simulants, and missing data were addressed through five imputation methods. Subsequently, four machine learning models (SVM, BPNN, RF, and XGBoost) were developed, with SHAP values and partial dependence plots (PDP) enhancing model interpretability. The results demonstrate that the KNN imputation technique effectively leveraged local similarities in the data to fill missing values, and the XGBoost model exhibited the best performance in the prediction task. Key features influencing the predictions included relative density (D<inf>r</inf>), minimum density (ρ<inf>min</inf>), maximum density (ρ<inf>max</inf>), uniformity coefficient (Cu), and curvature coefficient (Cc). The model's predictions for the SSP of real lunar soil were highly consistent with the reference values. The absolute values of errors for ϕ are range from 1.53° to 4.33°, while the deviation of c from the reference values ranges from 2.18 to 4.99 kPa. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The urban heat island (UHI) effect has become one of the most critical environmental consequences of urbanization, fundamentally linked to the accumulation of building material stocks and modification of natural surfaces. This study develops a comprehensive quantitative framework to analyze the combined effects of building material stock and green infrastructure on UHI intensity in Beijing, China. Using remote sensing data and interpretable machine learning approaches, particularly partial dependence analysis, we reveal the nonlinear relationships and interaction effects between urban physical characteristics and UHI intensity. The results identify a critical threshold of brick material stock at approximately 3×108 tons, beyond which UHI intensity increases sharply. Our findings advance the understanding of urban thermal environment regulation by quantifying both the individual and interactive effects of material stocks and green infrastructure, providing insights for optimizing urban heat mitigation strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - If a product deviates from its desired properties in the injection moulding process, its root cause analysis can be aided by models that relate the input machine settings with the output quality characteristics. The machine learning models tested in the quality prediction are mostly black boxes; therefore, no direct explanation of their prognosis is given, which restricts their applicability in the quality control. The previously attempted explainability methods are either restricted to tree-based algorithms only or do not emphasize on the fact that some explainability methods can lead to wrong root cause identification of a product's deviation from its desired properties. This study first shows that the interactions among the multiple input machine settings do exist in real experimental data collected as per a central composite design. Then, the model-agnostic explainable AI methods are compared for the first time to show that different explainability methods indeed lead to different feature impact analysis in injection moulding. Moreover, it is shown that the better feature attribution translates to the correct cause identification and actionable insights for the injection moulding process. Being model agnostic, explanations on both random forest and multilayer perceptron are performed for the cause analysis, as both models have the mean absolute percentage error of less than 0.05% on the experimental dataset. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Maize leaf diseases pose significant threats to global agricultural productivity, yet traditional diagnostic methods are slow, subjective, and resource-intensive. This study proposes a lightweight and interpretable convolutional neural network (CNN) model for accurate and efficient classification of maize leaf diseases. Using the ‘Corn or Maize Leaf Disease Dataset’, the model classifies four disease categories Healthy, Gray Leaf Spot, Common Rust, and Northern Leaf Blight with 94.97 % accuracy and a micro-average AUC of 0.99. With only 1.22 million parameters, the model supports real-time inference on mobile devices, making it ideal for field applications. Data augmentation and transfer learning techniques were applied to ensure robust generalization. To enhance transparency and user trust, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, including LIME and SHAP, were employed to identify disease-relevant features such as lesions and pustules, with SHAP achieving an IoU of 0.82. The proposed model outperformed benchmark models like ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNetB0 in both accuracy and computational efficiency. Robustness tests under simulated environmental challenges confirmed its adaptability, with only a 2.82 % performance drop under extreme conditions. Comparative analyses validated its statistical significance and practical superiority. This model represents a reliable, fast, and explainable solution for precision agriculture, especially in resource-constrained environments. Future enhancements will include multi-angle imaging, multimodal inputs, and extended datasets to improve adaptability and scalability in real-world conditions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study proposes a novel deep learning-based approach for financial risk early warning in listed companies through a hierarchical attention network that integrates multi-dimensional data sources. Traditional financial risk prediction models often struggle with complex non-linear relationships and fail to effectively combine diverse information types. We develop a comprehensive framework that simultaneously processes financial statements, market trading data, and textual information through specialized neural network components. The model employs a two-level attention mechanism that dynamically weights both individual features and information sources, enabling interpretable risk assessment. Using data from 2,876 Chinese A-share listed companies from 2015 to 2024, our empirical analysis demonstrates that the proposed model achieves superior predictive performance (AUC-ROC: 0.873) compared to traditional statistical approaches (0.742–0.768) and conventional machine learning methods (0.812–0.845). The model provides early warning signals approximately 4.2 months before actual distress events, significantly outperforming benchmark models (2.3–3.7 months). Notably, the model maintains robust performance during market stress periods (accuracy: 0.798) compared to traditional models (accuracy: 0.678). The attention mechanism reveals that the relative importance of different risk indicators varies systematically with market conditions, with financial ratios dominating during stable periods (weight: 0.435) and market signals becoming more crucial during crises (weight: 0.412). These findings contribute to both the theoretical understanding of financial risk dynamics and practical risk management applications, while demonstrating the effectiveness of interpretable deep learning approaches in financial analysis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Agriculture is the foundation of life that faces numerous daily attacks from nature and living organisms. A major challenge for farmers is timely plant disease identification, which is crucial to prevent productivity losses and the production of poor-quality products. Researchers have recently been focusing on automating the plant leaf disease recognition process using computer vision and machine learning techniques. More importantly, the recent developments in deep learning have significantly advanced the field of plant leaf disease recognition. Regardless of these advancements, significant challenges remain in automatic leaf disease recognition, and researchers are continuing to seek better performance, in-field applicability, and compatibility with resource-constrained devices. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of real-world and laboratory datasets, feature extraction methods, deep learning frameworks, limitations, recommendations, and future directions for deep plant leaf disease recognition. It offers a detailed comparative analysis of various deep learning models applied to different datasets, preprocessing techniques, and data collection methods. This work also highlights the need for an ideal dataset and explores future directions like the Internet of Things integration, Explainable AI, and Smart Farming, which previous surveys have not covered. The primary aim of this survey is to assist researchers in understanding state-of-the-art plant leaf disease recognition techniques, support farmers in the field of plant pathology, address limitations, provide recommendations and outline future directions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The left ventricle (LV), as the primary chamber responsible for systemic circulation, plays a crucial role in cardiac function assessment. Echocardiography which particularly focuses on LV, is vital for cardiac disease diagnosis. However, the diagnostic accuracy heavily depends on image quality, which requires systematic assessment. In this study, we propose a two-stage deep learning approach for echocardiographic quality surveillance using a dataset of 514 annotated videos. The first stage employs EchoNet, to extract LV volumes of interest. The second stage introduces ST-R(2 + 1)D-ConvNeXt, a novel ConvNeXt-based model designed to disentangle spatiotemporal features and leverage echocardiographic hallmarks within the apical-four-chamber (A4C) dynamic echocardiogram data. The proposed approach achieves an accuracy of 82.63 %, an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.89, a sensitivity of 84.10 %, and a specificity of 81.08 % in classifying echocardiographic videos into high and low quality. Furthermore, through explainable AI techniques, our model identifies specific quality issues such as missing cardiac walls, distorted or poorly positioned chambers, and other anomalies, providing interpretable feedback for clinical applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The integration of deep learning techniques with financial technology (fintech) has revolutionized the credit risk analysis, a critical component of financial risk management. A pervasive challenge in credit risk assessment lies in the skewed distribution of data, hindering accurate predictions, particularly for minority class instances. In available literature, various solutions have been proposed to address class imbalance, albeit with limitations. Focal loss is one of the well-known loss functions proposed for handling class imbalance by running the hyperparameter (Formula presented.). However, imbalance still remains in terms of number of hard-to-learn observations between the classes. In this paper, we have proposed integration of ADASYN with focal loss to mitigate class imbalance and enhance credit scoring accuracy. ADASYN systematically generates synthetic data based on hard-to-learn examples to counter skewed distributions, while focal loss prioritizes the training of challenging examples, fostering a more balanced model performance. This approach has been rigorously tested using real-world imbalanced datasets and credit assessment data, and the outcomes have been compared against a range of sample technique and loss function combinations. The results clearly show that our suggested strategy is better than other approaches. Although improving the accuracy of credit risk analysis is critical, model interpretability is just as important for enabling financial analysts to make wise choices. In order to solve this, we have measured the global and local contributions of each feature using SHAP (Shapley additive explanation). According to global interpretability, the top 4 parameters influencing credit risk assessment are checking account status, loan purpose, borrower age, credit history, and interest rate/installment rate. Moreover, local interpretability analysis reveals quantitative and direction differences in feature contributions. These revelations not only broaden our knowledge of credit assessment services but also highlight how important a role they could play in attracting new clients and generating income. This paper also highlights how the suggested approach may be scaled to other imbalanced real-world datasets, demonstrating how it can improve model performance in terms of AUC, G-mean, and F-measure. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites, possessing some unique properties, like high specific strength, stiffness, corrosion and temperature resistance etc. have now become attractive choices in many of the aviation, automobile, marine, military, medical, construction and sports industries. But, their anisotropic and non-homogeneous structure, and low thermal conductivity make them quite difficult to machine, occasionally leading to excessive tool wear and poor surface quality. In this paper, treating spindle speed (N), feed rate (f) and depth of cut (a<inf>p</inf>) as the input parameters, 27 milling experiments are conducted on CFRP composite laminates based on Taguchi’s L<inf>27</inf> orthogonal array, and their effects on material removal rate (MRR), and two surface roughness parameters, i.e. Ra and Rz are investigated. Results of the parametric analysis are later validated using an explainable artificial intelligence technique, in the form of Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), accompanied by ascertaining the most significant input parameters affecting each of the responses of the milling process. The said process is finally optimized using a multi-criteria decision making tool, i.e. technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), identifying an ideal combination of the milling parameters as N = 7500 rpm, f = 0.3 mm/sec and a<inf>p</inf> = 1.5 mm, resulting in simultaneous maximization of MRR and minimization of the two surface roughness parameters. This paper thus provides a new framework for parametric analysis and multi-objective optimization of milling of CFRP composite laminates resulting in higher productivity along with better surface quality. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Recently, ensemble-based machine learning models have been widely used and have demonstrated their efficiency in bankruptcy prediction. However, these algorithms are black box models and people cannot understand why they make their forecasts. This explains why interpretability methods in machine learning attract attention from many artificial intelligence researchers. In this paper, we evaluate the prediction performance of Random Forest, LightGBM, XGBoost, and NGBoost (Natural Gradient Boosting for probabilistic prediction) for French firms from different industries with the horizon of 1–5 years. We then use Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), a model-agnostic method to explain XGBoost, one of the best models for our data. SHAP can show how each feature impacts the output from XGBoost. Furthermore, single prediction can also be explained, thus allowing black box models to be used in credit risk management. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Amid the ongoing digital transformation of higher education, increasing attention has been paid to the impact of digital technologies on teaching quality—particularly in physical education settings that require high levels of interaction and physical engagement. This study examined 1158 university students across China using a cross-sectional design, integrating interpretable machine learning models with structural equation modeling to systematically assess how the frequency of use of seven common digital technologies influences teaching quality in physical education classes. The study also investigated the mediating roles of perceived teacher support and academic self-efficacy. Nine machine learning models and logistic regression analyses were conducted to predict teaching quality, employing feature permutation importance and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to evaluate the relative contribution of each digital tool. Results identified multimedia courseware, e-textbooks, and question banks as the most influential predictors of teaching quality. The SHAP analysis further revealed that management software, educational websites, and multimedia materials had significant positive effects and exhibited synergistic interactions in improving teaching outcomes. Structural equation modeling showed that digital technology use had a significant direct positive effect on teaching quality (B = 0.347, p < 0.001). Moreover, perceived teacher support and academic self-efficacy not only served as independent mediators (95% CI = [0.146, 0.226], p < 0.001; 95% CI = [0.024, 0.063], p < 0.001) but also functioned as a chain mediating effect (95% CI = [0.036, 0.083], p < 0.001). This study is the first to integrate interpretable machine learning with structural modeling to elucidate the mechanisms through which digital technologies influence teaching quality in university-level physical education. The findings underscore the critical mediating roles of teacher support and student self-efficacy, providing both theoretical contributions and practical implications for enhancing digital pedagogy in higher education. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The integration of advanced computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques into collaborative robotic systems holds the potential to revolutionize human–robot interaction, productivity, and safety. Despite substantial research activity, a systematic synthesis of how vision and AI are jointly enabling context-aware, adaptive cobot capabilities across perception, planning, and decision-making remains lacking (especially in recent years). Addressing this gap, our review unifies the latest advances in visual recognition, deep learning, and semantic mapping within a structured taxonomy tailored to collaborative robotics. We examine foundational technologies such as object detection, human pose estimation, and environmental modeling, as well as emerging trends including multimodal sensor fusion, explainable AI, and ethically guided autonomy. Unlike prior surveys that focus narrowly on either vision or AI, this review uniquely analyzes their integrated use for real-world human–robot collaboration. Highlighting industrial and service applications, we distill the best practices, identify critical challenges, and present key performance metrics to guide future research. We conclude by proposing strategic directions—from scalable training methods to interoperability standards—to foster safe, robust, and proactive human–robot partnerships in the years ahead. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The increasing integration of renewable energy sources (RES) in power systems presents challenges related to variability, stability, and efficiency, particularly in smart microgrids. This systematic review, following the PRISMA 2020 methodology, analyzed 66 studies focused on advanced energy storage systems, intelligent control strategies, and optimization techniques. Hybrid storage solutions combining battery systems, hydrogen technologies, and pumped hydro storage were identified as effective approaches to mitigate RES intermittency and balance short- and long-term energy demands. The transition from centralized to distributed control architectures, supported by predictive analytics, digital twins, and AI-based forecasting, has improved operational planning and system monitoring. However, challenges remain regarding interoperability, data privacy, cybersecurity, and the limited availability of high-quality data for AI model training. Economic analyses show that while initial investments are high, long-term operational savings and improved resilience justify the adoption of advanced microgrid solutions when supported by appropriate policies and financial mechanisms. Future research should address the standardization of communication protocols, development of explainable AI models, and creation of sustainable business models to enhance resilience, efficiency, and scalability. These efforts are necessary to accelerate the deployment of decentralized, low-carbon energy systems capable of meeting future energy demands under increasingly complex operational conditions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Employee turnover poses a multi-faceted challenge to organizations by undermining productivity, morale, and financial stability while rendering recruitment, onboarding, and training investments wasteful. Traditional machine learning approaches often struggle with class imbalance and lack transparency, limiting actionable insights. This study introduces an Explainable AI (XAI) framework to achieve both high predictive accuracy and interpretability in turnover forecasting. Methods: Two publicly available HR datasets (IBM HR Analytics, Kaggle HR Analytics) were preprocessed with label encoding and MinMax scaling. Class imbalance was addressed via GAN-based synthetic data generation. A three-layer Transformer encoder performed binary classification, and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis provided both global and local feature attributions. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC metrics. Results: On the IBM dataset, the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) Transformer model achieved 92.00% accuracy, 96.67% precision, 87.00% recall, 91.58% F1, and 96.32% ROC AUC. On the Kaggle dataset, it reached 96.95% accuracy, 97.28% precision, 96.60% recall, 96.94% F1, and 99.15% ROC AUC, substantially outperforming classical resampling methods (ROS, SMOTE, ADASYN) and recent literature benchmarks. SHAP explanations highlighted JobSatisfaction, Age, and YearsWithCurrManager as top predictors in IBM and number project, satisfaction level, and time spend company in Kaggle. Conclusion: The proposed GAN Transformer SHAP pipeline delivers state-of-the-art turnover prediction while furnishing transparent, actionable insights for HR decision-makers. Future work should validate generalizability across diverse industries and develop lightweight, real-time implementations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The digital transformation of the Architecture, Engineering and Construction sector is accelerating the adoption of digital platforms as critical enablers of data integration, stakeholder collaboration and process optimization. This paper presents a systematic review of 125 peer-reviewed journal articles (2015–2025), selected through a PRISMA-guided search using the Scopus database, with inclusion criteria focused on English-language academic literature on platform-enabled digitalization in the built environment. Studies were grouped into six thematic domains, i.e., artificial intelligence in construction, digital twin integration, lifecycle cost management, BIM-GIS for underground utilities, energy systems and public administration, based on a combination of literature precedent and domain relevance. Unlike existing reviews focused on single technologies or sectors, this work offers a cross-sectoral synthesis, highlighting shared challenges and opportunities across disciplines and lifecycle stages. It identifies the functional roles, enabling technologies and systemic barriers affecting digital platform adoption, such as fragmented data sources, limited interoperability between systems and siloed organizational processes. These barriers hinder the development of integrated and adaptive digital ecosystems capable of supporting real-time decision-making, participatory planning and sustainable infrastructure management. The study advocates for modular, human-centered platforms underpinned by standardized ontologies, explainable AI and participatory governance models. It also highlights the importance of emerging technologies, including large language models and federated learning, as well as context-specific platform strategies, especially for applications in the Global South. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Raman spectroscopy has become an indispensable analytical technique in pharmaceutical research, offering non-invasive, rapid, and chemically specific insights into pharmaceutical compounds. In this study, we present a comprehensive benchmark of machine learning models for classifying 32 pharmaceutical compounds based on their Raman spectral signatures. A diverse array of algorithms—including Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forests, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM), and 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)—were evaluated on a publicly available dataset. The results demonstrate outstanding classification performance across models, with linear SVM achieving the highest accuracy of 99.88%, followed closely by CNN (99.26%). Ensemble methods such as Random Forest and XGBoost also yielded high accuracies above 98.3%. In addition to strong predictive performance, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis was employed to interpret model decisions. CNN models, in particular, revealed well-localized and chemically meaningful spectral regions critical to classification. This combination of high accuracy and interpretability highlights the promise of explainable AI in pharmaceutical analysis and quality control, offering robust, transparent, and scalable solutions for real-world applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The integration of shared autonomous vehicles into historic urban areas presents both opportunities and challenges. In heritage-rich environments like very old Asian (such as Suzhou old town, which serves as a use case example) or European (especially Mediterranean coastal cities) areas—characterized by narrow alleys, dense development, and sensitive cultural landscapes—shared autonomous vehicle adoption raises critical spatial and social questions. This study employs a qualitative, user-centered approach based on the ripple model to examine residents’ perceptions across four dimensions: residential patterns, parking land use, regional accessibility, and street-level infrastructure. Semi-structured interviews with 27 participants reveal five key findings: (1) public trust depends on transparent decision-making and safety guarantees; (2) shared autonomous vehicles may reshape generational residential clustering; (3) the short-term parking demand remains stable, but the long-term reuse of space is feasible; (4) shared autonomous vehicles could enhance accessibility in historic cores; (5) transport systems may evolve toward intelligent, human-centered designs. Based on these insights, the study proposes three strategies: (1) transparent risk assessment using explainable artificial intelligence and digital twins; (2) polycentric development to diversify land use; (3) hierarchical street retrofitting to balance mobility and preservation. While this study is limited by its qualitative scope and absence of simulation, it offers a framework for culturally sensitive, small-scale interventions supporting sustainable mobility transitions in historic urban contexts. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - One of the fundamental challenges in managing software and information technology projects is monitoring and predicting project status at the end of each sprint, release or project. Agile project management has emerged over the past two decades, significantly impacting project success. However, no comprehensive approach based on the features of this approach has been found in studies to monitor and predict the status of a sprint, release or project. This study aims to develop a data-driven approach for predicting the status of software projects based on agility features. For this purpose, 22 agility features were first identified to evaluate and predict the status of projects in four aspects: Endurance, Effectiveness, Efficiency, and Complexity. The findings indicate that the aspects of Effectiveness and Efficiency have the greatest impact on project success. Additionally, the results show that features related to team work, team capacity, experience and project objectives have the most significant impact on project success. An artificial neural network algorithm was then used, and a model was developed to predict project status, which was optimized using the Neural Architecture Search algorithm with a 93 percent accuracy rate. The neural network model was interpreted using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm, and sensitivity analysis was performed on the important components. Finally, the behavior of the projects in each category was analyzed and evaluated using the Apriori algorithm. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Against the backdrop of global climate change and rapid urbanization, understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics and driving mechanisms of vegetation net primary productivity (NPP) is critical for ensuring regional ecological security and achieving carbon neutrality goals. This study focuses on the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration (YRDUA) and integrates multi-source remote sensing data with socioeconomic statistics. By combining interpretable machine learning (XGBoost-SHAP) with multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR), and incorporating Theil–Sen trend analysis and Mann–Kendall significance testing, we systematically analyze the spatiotemporal variations in NPP and its multiscale driving mechanisms from 2001 to 2020. The results reveal the following: (1) Total NPP in the YRDUA shows an increasing trend, with approximately 24.83% of the region experiencing a significant rise and only 2.75% showing a significant decline, indicating continuous improvement in regional ecological conditions. (2) Land use change resulted in a net NPP loss of 2.67 TgC, yet ecological restoration and advances in agricultural technology effectively mitigated negative impacts and became the main contributors to NPP growth. (3) The results from XGBoost and MGWR are complementary, highlighting the scale-dependent effects of driving factors—at the regional scale, natural factors such as elevation (DEM), precipitation (PRE), and vegetation cover (VFC) have positive impacts on NPP, while the human footprint (HF) generally exerts a negative effect. However, in certain areas, a dose–response effect is observed, in which moderate human intervention can enhance ecological functions. (4) The spatial heterogeneity of NPP is mainly driven by nonlinear interactions between natural and anthropogenic factors. Notably, the interaction between DEM and climatic variables exhibits threshold responses and a “spatial gradient–factor interaction” mechanism, where the same driver may have opposite effects under different geomorphic conditions. Therefore, a well-balanced combination of land use transformation and ecological conservation policies is crucial for enhancing regional ecological functions and NPP. These findings provide scientific support for ecological management and the formulation of sustainable development strategies in urban agglomerations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Accurate crop yield prediction is vital towards optimizing agricultural productivity. Machine Learning (ML) has shown promise in this field; however, its application to legume crops, especially to lupin, remains limited, while many models lack interpretability, hindering real-world adoption. To bridge this literature gap, an interpretable ML framework was developed for predicting lupin yield using Sentinel-2 remote sensing data integrated with georeferenced yield measurements. Data preprocessing involved computing vegetation indices, removing outliers, addressing multicollinearity, normalizing feature scales, and applying data augmentation techniques to correct target imbalance. Subsequently, six ML models were evaluated representing different algorithmic strategies. Among them, XGBoost showed the best performance ((Formula presented.) = 0.8756) and low error values across (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), and (Formula presented.) metrics. To enhance model transparency, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values were applied to interpret the feature contributions of the XGBoost model. The Enhanced Vegetation Index ((Formula presented.)) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ((Formula presented.)) were found to be key predictors of crop yield, both showing a positive correlation with higher values reflecting greater vegetation vigor and corresponding to increased yield. These were followed by (Formula presented.) (green) and (Formula presented.) (short-wave infrared), which captured key reflectance properties associated with chlorophyll activity and water content, respectively. Both of them substantially influence photosynthetic efficiency and plant health, ultimately affecting yield potential. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Data are most important for any manufacturing processes in decision-making. It is important to monitor this data to improve the productivity of processes. Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is a very effective tool for capturing process information. This work focus on implement of IIoT in TIG welding processes. We developed an IIoT-enabled TIG welding setup that tracks key parameters like current, travel speed, gas flow rate, and arc gap in real time. This data is sent to a cloud platform and displayed through an easy-to-use mobile app, giving welders and engineers clear visibility into the process. This work also explore the potential application of IIoT in inspection to improve the inspection process. By capturing and processing weld images, we could measure bead width and detect any visible surface defects using edge detection and contour analysis. Also, Mobile based application is developed to store the inspection results of LPT, UT and metallography for proper documentation and analysis. The implementation of machine learning using XGBoost algorithm is discussed to predict the mechanical properties like, Ultimate tensile strength and hardness of HAZ and weld. The model performed very well, achieving over 95% accuracy, and was further explained using SHAP tools so we could understand not just what the model predicted, but why. For example, we could see how changing travel speed or gas flow affected the final weld quality. In short, this work demonstrates how combining IIoT, machine learning, and image processing can make TIG welding smarter, more reliable, and easier to control. It turns raw. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Construction schedule delays are a persistent challenge in India’s infrastructure sector, leading to significant cost overruns, stakeholder dissatisfaction, and inefficient resource utilization. In this context, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into project forecasting offers a promising solution. This study presents an AI-driven predictive modeling framework aimed at estimating construction schedule adherence, with a dual focus on predictive accuracy and model interpretability. Three machine learning models—multiple linear regression (MLR), artificial neural networks (ANN), and gradient boosting machine (GBM)—were developed and evaluated using real-world data from 150 construction projects across India. The models were assessed based on standard performance metrics (MAE, RMSE, R²), computational efficiency, and transparency. While MLR offered high interpretability, it lacked accuracy in handling nonlinear interactions. ANN showed high accuracy but limited explainability. GBM outperformed both, achieving the best predictive performance (R² = 0.94) and a favorable trade-off between accuracy and interpretability. Feature importance and sensitivity analyses identified equipment utilization, material availability, and labor productivity as key influencers. Case study validation further reinforced the practical value of GBM in diverse project settings. The findings advocate for the strategic adoption of interpretable AI tools like GBM in construction management to enhance scheduling precision and decision-making efficiency. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Monitoring ground settlement states during tunnel boring machine (TBM) excavation in metro tunnels is crucial for construction quality and disaster prevention. However, current studies mainly focus on anomaly detection and alarm of settlement measurements, with less attention to monitoring underlying excavation influencing parameters. Moreover, these parameters commonly vary following the geological types and TBM operating states, which means if the monitor method fails to distinguish the difference in geological types and operating modes may trigger false alarms. To address above issues, an index-related operating parameters anomaly detection framework with full consideration of the multi-point distribution intrinsic property for settlement is proposed. This framework realizes adaptive monitoring across different geological types and operating modes and provides interpretability analysis for detection results through Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). Specifically, the properties of spatio-distributed settlement are firstly represented and utilized to enhance monitoring capability. Then, geological types are identified, and working condition division rules are deduced from variable effect parameters. Next, dual monitoring statistics and control limits are derived by latent variables and reconstruction errors of Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to monitor the settlement-related parameters of main mode in the most common geological type. The improved instance transfer strategy K-TrA, enhancing source-target domain similarity and reducing iteration time, is elaborated to adapt to variable working modes. Meanwhile, parameter transfer based fine-tuning strategy is adopted to monitor the main mode in other geological types. Afterward, SHapley Additive exPlanations(SHAP) is utilized to further analyze the contributions of various parameters to detection results. Finally, the performance of proposed method is verified on a real-case. Ablation and comparative experiments confirm its superiority in predictive accuracy and anomaly detection rate. Thus, our work can offer new insights for settlement monitoring and valuable guidance to field engineers. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Accurate classification of surrounding rock grades during Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) operations is essential for optimizing excavation parameters and ensuring construction safety. However, traditional classification methods face challenges, particularly in adapting to complex geological conditions and achieving high efficiency in model optimization. To address these issues, this study proposes an identification methodology based on the COA-XGBoost framework. Initially, raw data is preprocessed to eliminate anomalous instances, such as those arising from equipment malfunctions or maintenance activities, using a state discrimination function. To better capture the interaction dynamics between the TBM and the surrounding rock, a novel feature parameter, specific energy, is introduced. The Relief algorithm is employed to evaluate feature importance and assign weights to TBM operational parameters, amplifying the role of critical features while minimizing interference from redundant ones. Subsequently, the Coati Optimization Algorithm (COA) is integrated with the XGBoost classifier, enabling global parameter optimization and enhancing the model's performance. The proposed method was validated using data from the water conveyance tunnel section of the Yinchuojiliao Project. Results demonstrate that the Relief algorithm effectively enhances the model's ability to identify critical parameters through feature weighting. The COA-optimized XGBoost model achieves a significant improvement in recognition accuracy compared to traditional approaches, with accuracy gains of approximately 8%, particularly excelling under complex geological conditions such as Class IV and Class V surrounding rocks. The final model achieves an accuracy of 91.5%, with recall and F1 scores reaching 91.5% and 91.4%, respectively. Additionally, five-fold cross-validation highlights the model's robustness and generalization capabilities. Furthermore, a SHAP-based interpretability analysis clarifies the relative contributions of each feature to the classification outcome, offering valuable insights for practical TBM parameter optimization. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The construction industry is one of the most hazardous sectors worldwide, with extremely high rates of occupational deaths and injuries. Worker fatigue, caused by undertaking physically demanding tasks in awkward working postures over prolonged daily durations, has been recognized as the main cause of these accidents. Additionally, fatigue can lead to reduced work efficiency and increased absenteeism, undermining labor productivity. This study aims to develop an accurate and reliable model to estimate the fatigue levels of construction workers. Field studies were conducted with 156 construction workers at four construction sites in mainland China. A series of physiological, personal, work-related, and environmental factors were measured and monitored to establish an interpretable machine learning model for assessing fatigue levels. The developed interpretable machine learning model exhibited good fitting with high accuracy, evidenced by the random forest model attaining an R2 value of 0.9953 through the 10-fold cross-validation method. Furthermore, this model could transparently reveal the mechanisms underlying the prediction of worker fatigue. Work duration, work session (i.e., morning session, afternoon session), environmental parameters (i.e., air temperature, humidity, wind velocity, and radiation), and worker age were identified as key factors affecting the fatigue of construction workers. The developed fatigue model can prevent excessive fatigue among construction workers, and the model interpretation results may benefit the industry by making solid guidelines and practice notes to alleviate worker fatigue. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Accurate flood estimation is crucial for the sustainable design of resilient urban infrastructures, especially in ungauged regions where data scarcity limits traditional hydrological analyses. This study introduces an innovative explainable stacking ensemble learning framework to predict design floods with return periods of 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 and 500 years. The model integrates diverse machine learning techniques to capture the nonlinear and complex relationships between flood magnitudes and catchment characteristics. In the first level of the ensemble, four base models, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), and Extremely Randomized Trees (ERT), are trained. A linear Elastic-Net regression model at the second level combines the results of these base models for the final flood estimates. Performance analysis shows that MLP performs best for lower return periods, while ERT excels for higher ones. Overall, the stacking model outperforms individual models across all return periods, demonstrating its robustness. To enhance model interpretability, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) values are used to reveal the contribution of catchment characteristics to flood behavior, identifying key flood drivers. The results show how feature importance changes with return periods, supporting context-specific decision-making. This research pioneers the use of explainable AI (XAI) in stacking ensemble models for flood estimation, offering a transparent and actionable methodology for urban flood risk management. By integrating advanced modeling, explainability, and remote sensing data through Google Earth Engine, the proposed framework provides a robust decision-support tool for practitioners and policymakers, enhancing the resilience of urban infrastructure to flood hazards. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: Despite substantial advancements in both treatment and prevention, colorectal cancer continues to be a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality. This study investigated the potential of using demographics and prescribed drug information to predict risk of colorectal cancer using a machine learning approach. Methods: Five different machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Random Forests, kNN, and Voting Classifier, were initially developed and evaluated for their predictive capabilities across various time horizons (3, 6, 12, and 36 months). To enhance transparency and interpretability, explainable techniques were employed to understand the model's predictions and identify the relative contributions of factors like age, sex, social status, and prescribed medications, promoting trust and clinical insights. While all developed models, including simpler ones such as Logistic Regression, demonstrated comparable performance, the Voting Classifier, as an ensemble model, was selected for further investigation due to its inherent diversity and generalizability. This ensemble model combines predictions from multiple base models, reducing the risk of overfitting and improving the robustness of the final prediction. Results: The model demonstrated consistent performance across these time horizons, achieving a precision consistently above 0.99, indicating high ability in identifying patients at risk. However, the recall remained relatively low (around 0.6), highlighting the model's limitations in comprehensively identifying all at risk patients, despite its high precision. This suggests additional investigations in future studies to further enhance the performance of the proposed model. Conclusion: Machine learning models can identify individuals at higher risk for developing colorectal cancer, enabling earlier interventions and personalized risk management strategies. However, further studies are needed before implementation in clinical practice. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Image segmentation is a critical step in computational biomedical image analysis, typically evaluated using metrics like the Dice coefficient during training and validation. However, in clinical settings without manual annotations, assessing segmentation quality becomes challenging, and models lacking reliability indicators face adoption barriers. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework for predicting segmentation quality without requiring ground truth annotations during test time. Our approach introduces two complementary frameworks: one leveraging predicted segmentation and uncertainty maps, and another integrating the original input image, uncertainty maps, and predicted segmentation maps. We present Bayesian adaptations of two benchmark segmentation models—SwinUNet and Feature Pyramid Network with ResNet50—using Monte Carlo Dropout, Ensemble, and Test Time Augmentation to quantify uncertainty. We evaluate four uncertainty estimates—confidence map, entropy, mutual information, and expected pairwise Kullback–Leibler divergence—on 2D skin lesion and 3D liver segmentation datasets, analyzing their correlation with segmentation quality metrics. Our framework achieves an R2 score of 93.25 and Pearson correlation of 96.58 on the HAM10000 dataset, outperforming previous segmentation quality assessment methods. For 3D liver segmentation, Test Time Augmentation with entropy achieves an R2 score of 85.03 and a Pearson correlation of 65.02, demonstrating cross-modality robustness. Additionally, we propose an aggregation strategy that combines multiple uncertainty estimates into a single score per image, offering a more robust and comprehensive assessment of segmentation quality compared to evaluating each measure independently. The proposed uncertainty-aware segmentation quality prediction network is interpreted using gradient-based methods such as Grad-CAM and feature embedding analysis through UMAP. These techniques provide insights into the model's behavior and reliability, helping to assess the impact of incorporating uncertainty into the segmentation quality prediction pipeline.

AB  - Exploring the environmental influence patterns on active leisure travel (ALT) is crucial for comprehending how spatial contexts shape travel behavior. Although previous studies have linked environmental factors to ALT participation, their influence on ALT paces across different modes remains underexplored. This study collects 10,649 crowdsourced GPS trajectory datasets to depict the distribution of walking, jogging, and cycling paces in Shenzhen. By employing an explainable machine learning framework integrating XGBoost and SHAP, we reveal the nonlinear effects of both natural and built environments on ALT paces. Additionally, a k-means cluster analysis is applied to identify impact patterns among geographical units. Our results indicate that environmental features have different impact contributions on the paces of different travel modes, all demonstrating nonlinear relationships with thresholds. Moreover, influence patterns show significant variation across local regions, reflecting diverse environmental preferences for travel paces. These findings offer valuable insights for urban planners to implement context-specific interventions that foster ALT-friendly urban environments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Abstract: Food safety remains a critical public health conceated food causing significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Accurate and transparent risk assessment is essential to safeguard consumer health and support evidence-based regulatory decisions. This study introduces a comprehensive and novel AI framework that leverages machine learning, deep learning, and transformer-based models to classify food safety risks using the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) dataset, enhanced through advanced data enrichment techniques. The enriched dataset addressed challenges such as short explanations and class imbalances, resulting in significant performance improvements across all model categories. Transformer-based models, including BERT with an accuracy of 0.978 and RoBERTa with an accuracy of 0.979, outperformed traditional machine learning methods such as logistic regression, which achieved an accuracy of 0.954, and SVM, which reached 0.959, as well as deep learning models like LSTM, which obtained 0.971, and BiLSTM, which achieved 0.97 3. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques were applied to uncover critical insights into the models’ decision-making processes. Influential features such as salmonella, aflatoxins, and listeria were identified, enhancing model transparency and interpretability. The framework’s combination of data augmentation and XAI improves predictive accuracy while ensuring interpretability, making it suitable for real-time risk prioritization in regulatory surveillance. This study demonstrates the potential of AI-powered approaches for food safety risk assessment, bridging predictive accuracy with transparency to support more reliable and actionable food safety management systems.

AB  - Leptospirosis is a widespread zoonotic disease with complex spatio-temporal dynamics. This study investigates the use of Deep Neural Network (DNN) in combination with Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) for weekly spatio-temporal predictions of leptospirosis occurrence. The predictive model integrates hydroclimatic and environmental data to assess its effectiveness in predicting leptospirosis cases and quantifying key input variables in Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia. Using a DNN architecture with hyperparameter tuning via grid search, we developed a globally trained model that achieved an overall prediction accuracy of 70.5% across 214 pixels. We identified acidic soil and a higher presence of rubber plantations as strong predictors of leptospirosis occurrence. Additionally, mean temperature and minimum rainfall emerged as important hydroclimatic contributors. These insights enable public health authorities to proactively identify and prioritize high-risk areas for targeted interventions, improving disease mitigation strategies. Furthermore, the methodology is adaptable to other regions with similar environmental and socio-economic conditions, strengthening early warning systems and enhancing preparedness against future leptospirosis outbreaks. While demonstrated on leptospirosis prediction, the proposed DNN-LIME framework is adaptable to spatio-temporal challenges in diverse domains such as supply chain optimization, urban planning, and industrial risk management. The integration of interpretability via LIME ensures actionable insights for stakeholders beyond public health, bridging the gap between complex models and real-world decision-making. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The use of deep learning (DL) has been growing in tunnel-induced ground settlement risk modeling, eliminating the necessity for extensive prior risk management knowledge. Despite the success of deploying a DL model to predict risk, challenges prevail. (1) DL requires high-quality data, which is expensive and time-consuming to prepare, and (2) DL is a “black-box,” which is difficult to understand and interpret. In this instance, we address the following question in this paper: How can we accurately predict ground settlement with limited monitoring data using DL and concurrently provide effective explanations for the generated results? We propose a new DL approach combining explainable techniques to improve ground settlement risk modeling accuracy and explainability. Our approach comprises the following: (1) an interval type-2 fuzzy system to process limited data and improve its usability; (2) a novel causal-based feature selection to determine input parameters that have strong causal effects with ground settlement risk; and (3) a soft-type attention module to evaluate and allocate feature importance to inputs, guiding neural networks to concentrate on learning features in a more targeted manner. A case study is used to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its superiority in predicting ground settlement risk with a high degree of robustness. We suggest that our approach can help decision makers better understand the “how” and “what” of DL-produced outputs, improving decision making associated with managing safety in construction. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) are a great advantage that is coming to civil engineering in ways that detail accuracy can be enhanced, many tasks automated, and predictive modeling improved. Across some of the significant subdomains, these technologies allow for eminent progress in structural health monitoring, geotechnical engineering, hydraulic systems, construction management. Currently, AI-powered models such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), fuzzy logic, and evolution-based algorithms allow engineers to predict failure, optimize design, and better resource management of infrastructures. Yet, despite the potential, the adoption of AI, ML, and DL into civil engineering faces a host of challenges including data availability, computational complexity, model interpretability, integration with traditional systems, etc. High-quality, real-time data collection remains expensive and the resource-intensive nature of DL models limits their application to a large scale. In addition, the "black-box" nature of these models raises ethical and regulatory issues especially in decisions related to safety. Against this backdrop, this paper reviews current and potential applications of AI, ML, and DL in civil engineering within the framework of benefits and limitations of AI, ML, and DL, focusing on comparisons. Besides that, the paper outlines future directions regarding cloud computing, explainable AI, and regulatory frameworks. With all these changes within the scope of the discipline, AI-driven technologies will be major in safe, efficient, and sustainable infrastructure systems, provided that success is specifically dependent on addressing these key challenges. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - There can be many competing and contradictory explanations for a single model prediction, making it difficult to select which one to use. Current explanation evaluation frameworks measure quality by comparing against ideal "ground-truth"explanations, or by verifying model sensitivity to important inputs. We outline the limitations of these approaches, and propose three desirable principles to ground the future development of explanation evaluation strategies for local feature importance explanations. We propose a ground-truth Agnostic eXplanation Evaluation framework (AXE) for evaluating and comparing model explanations that satisfies these principles. Unlike prior approaches, AXE does not require access to ideal ground-truth explanations for comparison, or rely on model sensitivity - providing an independent measure of explanation quality. We verify AXE by comparing with baselines, and show how it can be used to detect explanation fairwashing.

AB  - A precise and efficient runoff forecasting model (RFM) is crucial for proactive government decision-making and risk management in catchment flood protection under changing climates. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to significant advancements in both theoretical research and practical applications within the field of hydrology. However, several challenges hinder the improvement of model accuracy and effectiveness in AI-based RFM. These challenges include the non-stationarity of hydrological data and the need for efficient feature extraction. This study addresses these issues by introducing a Transformer-based RFM (RFM_Trans) framework. Specifically, (1) we tackle the non-stationarity in hydrological data using the RFM_Trans framework and validate its performance on both large CAMELS-GB and local Chao Lake catchment datasets. (2) We employ a feature selection approach that integrates Pearson Correlation Analysis with eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques to provide recommendations for reducing input dimensions. (3) We test performances of different variants in RFM_Trans framework across different lead times. The results show that RFM_Trans statistically outperforms LSTM and Transformer models. The feature selection method identifies three specific features that enhances RFM_Trans performance in Chao Lake. RFM_Trans perform well in lead time less than 15 days. Sparse attention mechanisms demonstrate higher predictive accuracy in shorter lead times (<7 days), whereas full attention architectures exhibit superior performance for longer lead times (7–30 days). © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) can result in deleterious consequences when patients take multiple medications simultaneously, emphasizing the critical need for accurate DDI prediction. Computational methods for DDI prediction have garnered recent attention. However, current approaches concentrate solely on single-view features, such as atomic-view or substructure-view features, limiting predictive capacity. The scarcity of research on interpretability studies based on multi-view features is crucial for tracing interactions. Addressing this gap, we present MI-DDI, a multi-view feature-based interpretable deep learning framework for DDI. To fully extract multi-view features, we employ a Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) to learn atomic features from molecular graphs generated by RDkit, and transformer encoders are used to learn substructure-view embeddings from drug SMILES simultaneously. These atomic-view and substructure-view features are then amalgamated into a holistic drug embedding matrix. Subsequently, an intricately designed interaction module not only establishes a tractable path for understanding interactions but also directly informs the construction of weight matrices, enabling precise and interpretable interaction predictions. Validation on the BIOSNAP dataset and DrugBank dataset demonstrates MI-DDI’s superiority. It surpasses the current benchmarks by a substantial average of 3% on BIOSNAP and 1% on DrugBank. Additional experiments underscore the significance of atomic-view information for DDI prediction and confirm that our interaction module indeed learns more effective information for DDI prediction.

AB  - A digital twin (DT) is a virtual representation of a real-world object that has dynamic, bidirectional connections between the real-world object and its digital domain. With the advent of Industry 4.0, DT technology was initially applied in the engineering and manufacturing sectors, but recent research indicates DT may also be useful within the healthcare sector. The purpose of this study was to determine the potential applications of DT technology in the healthcare sector and offer suggestions for its effective implementation by healthcare institutions to increase service efficiency. Based on a review of the literature, we developed a model to demonstrate the applications of DTs on public and personal health. A questionnaire with five points Likert scale was then designed based on this model. Data were collected through an online survey conducted with 306 participants. To verify our hypothesized correlations among the constructs, structural equation modeling was used. The findings suggested that explainable artificial intelligence-based early diagnosis, simulation model-based vaccination, artificial intelligence location technology, sensor-based real-time health monitoring, and in silico personalized medicine are potential applications of DT that can increase healthcare efficiency. We also considered the moderating influence of (a) security and privacy and (b) certification and regulatory issues, acknowledging their pivotal roles in ensuring the successful implementation and widespread acceptance of DT technology in the field of healthcare. This study contributes to the body of knowledge in academia and offers useful insights for technologists, policymakers, and healthcare professionals who want to fully utilize DT technology to build an effective healthcare system that can adapt to the changing needs of communities and individuals. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Manufacturing products in multi-stage forming processes through blanking, deep-drawing and bending operations with progressive dies is one of the most economically relevant processes in the sheet metal forming industry and allows for complex geometries. In order to be able to ensure a reliable operation of the tools, manufacturers choose stroke speed conservatively, which limits the productivity and profitability. For this reason, this paper describes which productivity-limiting factors affect multi-stage forming processes and how machine learning in combination with explainable artificial intelligence methods can be used to identify and counteract productivity-limiting factors. By equipping the processes with multiple sensors, stroke rate-dependent anomalies can be detected at an early stage and countermeasures can be derived proactively, thus making the process more reliable and ensuring product quality. The methodology developed is demonstrated using two use cases which show that vibrations and friction in a progressive die are significantly reduced. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - It is important to point out that the precise prediction of water binder ratio “w/b ratio” or “W_C” is indispensable for gaining the desirable characteristics of strength and duration of concrete constructions. This research offers a new method for w/b ratio prediction based on state-of-art machine learning (ML) algorithms accompanied with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods. The main aspect of the research approach is described using 192 database containing different mix design parameters and the environmental conditions. With the help of ensemble learning models such as Random forest (RF), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model, Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) and Response surface methodology (RSM), the prediction model has performed better than the empirical methods with RVM-M3 surpass all other models with the highest R value equal to 0.9992 in calibration phase and RF-M3 surpassing other model combinations in verification phase with R value equal to 0.9984. Furthermore, the integration of XAI revealed the key influential variables affecting the w/b ratio prediction and the main influential variables related to w/b ratio as well as their importance are determined, where Cement (Ce) identified as the most impactful parameter that improved the prediction accuracy of RF-M3 model. The results prove that the proposed method increases the prediction accuracy and provides engineers with a dependable means of augmenting concrete mix designs to enhance concrete’s durability performance and sustainability. This research expands the understanding and principles of concrete technology, hence facilitating the use of AI-based solutions in civil engineering practices and other relevant domains. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Technological and industrial transformations driven by data science and artificial intelligence are profoundly impacting the field of materials science，presenting both unprecedented opportunities and significant challenges for the innovation of ener⁃getic materials. As an emerging technology，machine learning offers novel research paradigm for the molecular design and syn⁃ thesis of energetic materials. It is expected to solve the long⁃standing bottlenecks such as low efficiency，high cost，and lengthy development cycles. Although some successful cases have been reported，the application of machine learning across the full re⁃ search cycle of energetic molecules—design，screening，synthesis，and performance validation—remains in a relatively imma⁃ ture stage compared with the application in other advanced materials domains. This review outlines the current research status of machine learning⁃assisted development of energetic materials，summarizes its applications in molecular design，single⁃property prediction，and multi⁃property simultaneous prediction. Nonetheless，the use of machine learning in design and synthesis of en⁃ ergetic materials with targeted properties remains fraught with challenges. Future efforts should prioritize the control of data quali⁃ ty and the construction of standardization frameworks，the development of interpretable machine learning models，and the estab⁃ lishment of interdisciplinary integration platforms，further promoting the efficient creation of high⁃performance energetic materi⁃als. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The reciprocal relationship between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) highlights their synergistic potential in enhancing artificial intelligence (AI) applications. LLMs, with their natural language understanding and generative capabilities, support the automation of KG construction through entity recognition, relation extraction, and schema generation. Conversely, KGs serve as structured and interpretable data sources that improve the transparency, factual consistency and reliability of LLM-based applications, mitigating challenges such as hallucinations and lack of explainability. This study conducts a systematic literature review of 77 studies to examine AI methodologies supporting LLM–KG integration, including symbolic AI, machine learning, and hybrid approaches. The research explores diverse applications spanning healthcare, finance, justice, and industrial automation, revealing the transformative potential of this synergy. Through in-depth analysis, this study identifies key limitations in current approaches, including challenges in scalability with maintaining dynamic and real-time Knowledge Graphs, difficulty in adapting general-purpose LLMs to specialized domains, limited explainability in tracing model outputs to interpretable reasoning, and ethical concerns surrounding bias, fairness, and transparency. In response, the study highlights potential strategies to optimize LLM–KG synergy. The findings from this study provide actionable insights for researchers and practitioners aiming for robust, transparent, and adaptive AI systems to enhance knowledge-driven AI applications through LLM–KG integration, further advancing generative AI and explainable AI (XAI) applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study aims to develop a reliable method for predicting power plant construction costs during the early planning stages using ensemble machine learning techniques. Accurate cost predictions are essential for project feasibility, and this research highlights the strength of ensemble methods in improving prediction accuracy by combining the advantages of multiple models, offering a significant improvement over traditional approaches. This investigation employed the Random Forest (RF) algorithm to estimate the overall construction cost of a power plant. The RF algorithm was contrasted with single-learner machine learning models: Support Vector Regression (SVR) and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Performance measures, comprising the coefficient of determination ((Formula presented.)), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), were used to evaluate and contrast the performance of the implemented models. Statistical measures demonstrated that the RF approach surpassed alternative models, demonstrating the highest coefficient of determination for testing ((Formula presented.)) and the lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE = 29.27) for the testing dataset. The Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) technique was implemented to explain the significance and impact of predictor factors affecting power plant construction costs. The outcomes of this investigation provide crucial information for project decision-makers, allowing them to reduce discrepancies in projected costs and make informed decisions at the beginning of the construction phase. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Ensuring high levels of quality and efficiency is essential for compliance with ISO standards in chemical manufacturing. Traditional methods, such as Statistical Process Control (SPC) and Six Sigma, often lack adaptability and fail to offer interpretable insights. This study proposes a hybrid quality control model based on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), integrating fuzzy C-means clustering (FCM), machine learning (ML), and Fuzzy Inference Systems (FISs) to enhance defect prediction and interpretability in industrial environments. The approach uses fuzzy clusters to segment production batches, improving the understanding of process variability. A supervised ML model (XGBoost) is trained on historical data to predict defect probabilities, while an explainable FIS refines the final assessment using expert-defined rules. XAI techniques (SHAP and LIME) offer transparency and insight into the decision-making process. Experimental validation using a real-world white wine dataset, evaluated in terms of accuracy and interpretability, shows that the proposed model outperforms traditional approaches in both predictive performance and transparency. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining unsupervised clustering, predictive analytics, and fuzzy reasoning in an Industry 4.0 framework. This study provides a scalable and adaptable solution for real-time quality control in chemical manufacturing, improving decision support systems and enabling automated and explainable quality assessments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With construction project delays being a key factor influencing their financial sinews, issues related to contract law, thus rendering resources incapable, remain a contemporary issue all over the globe. Conventional techniques for predicting delays often do not deliver concrete predictions due to the multiplicity and dynamic character of construction tasks. In the study discussed here, different machine learning (ML) algorithms were investigated to foresee construction delays, and these include Gaussian Naïve Bayes, Adaboost, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting (GB), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). These models were measured for performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess their validity in real-life situations. The results indicate that the use of ensemble learning techniques such as Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost scores higher than others, thus exhibiting more accuracy and better predictive capacity. These can relate to convoluted relationships in construction data, which makes them suitable for yet another application in project risk management. In contrast, simpler models like Adaboost and Gaussian Naïve Bayes, despite being interpretable, held lesser predictive accuracy and hence were less qualified for construction delay forecasting. The study highlights the potential of ML-driven predictive models in aiding project management timely by enabling timely identification of prospective delays, thereby allowing for proactive decision-making and project control. Hence, hurdles like quality of data, interpretability of models, and integration with real-time project management systems ought to be surmounted for wide-scale adoption in the industry. Future studies ought to develop hybrid ML models that fit in explainable AI techniques and real-time data on construction applications to assure predictive accuracy and usability in practice. The findings show that ensemble-based delay prediction models have the potential to reduce the uncertainties related to projects, control delays, schedule resources efficiently, and ultimately improve the infrastructure project efficiency in costing and timely project completion. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, artificial intelligence (AI) black-box models called feedforward neural network (FFNN) as shallow learning and long short-term memory (LSTM) as deep learning were used to evaluate the biological oxygen demand of effluent (BOD<inf>eff</inf>) and chemical oxygen demand (COD<inf>eff</inf>) of the Tabriz wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Daily data of the treatment plant from 2015 to 2021 were utilized for this modeling. Given the importance of selecting effective input parameters for modeling, four scenarios were employed for optimal input selection. The first scenario was based on the correlation coefficient (CC) method, the second on the mutual information (MI) method, the third utilized the Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) method for ranking the parameters, and the fourth scenario applied newly proposed hybrid MI-SHAP method for a two-step selection of input parameters. In MI-SHAP method, the number of inputs was first reduced using the MI method, and then the remaining parameters were ranked by the SHAP algorithm and used in the modeling process. This procedure significantly reduced the SHAP runtime. The explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) algorithm named SHAP was also used to visualize and illustrate how parameters influence the modeling results. To evaluate the results provided by the SHAP, another algorithm of the XAI, called accumulated local effects (ALE), was used. Through the use of XAI to illustrate the contribution of each input to the results, it was determined that BOD<inf>eff</inf> and COD<inf>eff</inf> with a one-day lag (BOD<inf>eff(t-1)</inf> and COD<inf>eff(t-1)</inf>) were the most influential features in the FFNN and LSTM. These parameters contribute approximately 54 % and 65 % of the total impact on the modeling outcomes in FFNN, and 56 % and 60 % in LSTM modeling, respectively. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - One of the most widely used methods for the seismic retrofit of masonry structures is using anchorage systems. Tensile load (also referred to as pull-out force in this context) is one of the prominent loads applied to embedded anchors. Therefore, it is crucial to analyze and design the anchorage system to resist the pull-out force. Since experimental studies are time-consuming and labor-intensive, AI techniques have recently been successfully adopted to automate the prediction of the maximum pull-out force. While this approach has been successfully applied in concrete, there is still a significant gap in its application to masonry structures. This comprehensive study aims to bridge this gap by proposing suitable machine learning (ML) models and empirical equations that not only predict the pull-out force but also predict the various failure modes of the anchored steel rods in masonry. To achieve this, 13 distinct ML models, including both individual and ensemble models, were implemented for predicting each target variable. Optimization techniques were then used to fine-tune the hyperparameters, improving the performance of each ML model. A comparative study was conducted to evaluate the models against one another. Among all the models, the tuned Voting model, identified as the best for predicting pull-out force, showed an average error of about 3.0 kN and an R2 score of 93%. On the other hand, CatBoost demonstrated a strong performance with an accuracy of 90% and F1-score of about 89% in both the training and test data for predicting the failure modes. Further, Explainable ML (XML) provided valuable insights into the most important features involved in predicting both the pull-out force and failure modes. Moreover, the results showed that the proposed empirical equation produced satisfactory outcomes compared to other existing empirical equations in this context, achieving a total accuracy of 72% and an error of 7.5 kN. As a result of this study, accurate predictive models have been introduced that require only readily available information from any construction site to proceed. Furthermore, by comparing the capability of the XML used in this study with other analytical parametric studies such as finite element analysis, it was found that XML can serve as a suitable alternative for identifying the most important features of the pull-out behavior of metal anchors in masonry. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Climate disasters unfold multitudes of effects, from societal and commercial disruptions to fuel and power shortages. These consequences escalate further in cascading disasters, where individuals are more likely to respond unwarrantedly due to the lack of preparation and situational awareness. A noticeable gap exists in comprehending the linkages between public responses to such disasters and socioeconomic and spatial disparities, which are critical to the provision of effective guidance and situational information to those affected. Based on mobile phone data and various socioeconomic, built environment, and geographical variables, this study systematically examines human mobility-based public responses during a cascading fuel shortage crisis. The spatiotemporal analysis uncovered a significant increase in visits to gasoline stations during and after the crisis and a decrease in mean distance traveled at the Census Block Group level. Furthermore, mobility prediction models were constructed using the random forest regression algorithm, which can adequately forecast visits and mean distance traveled to gasoline stations across different crisis stages. The Shapley Additive Explanations analysis reveals how various factors (e.g., educational attainment and distance to the coast) influenced public responses. These findings reinforce the importance of tailored disaster response education and situational awareness to ensure equitable resource access during cascading disasters. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study investigates the performance of four boosting machine learning models, AdaBoost, XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM, for forecasting maximal (Tmax) and minimal (Tmin) air temperatures at six lead times: the same day and 1, 7, 15, 21, and 30 days ahead. Daily temperature data from the USGS 02187010 weather station (South Carolina, USA) were used for model training and validation. To address the challenges posed by the non-linearity and complexity of climate data, the models were integrated with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, specifically SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), which provide insights into the role of input features in shaping predictions. Results indicate that forecasting accuracy declines with increasing lead time. Among the tested models, CatBoost1 consistently exhibited the best performance. For Tmax forecasting on the validation set, CatBoost1 yielded a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.900, Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 0.810, root mean squared error (RMSE) of 3.447 °C, mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.571 °C, Willmott’s Index (WI) of 0.947, Legates and McCabe Index (LM) of 0.615, explained variance score (EVS) of 0.810, and absolute percentage bias (APB) of 15.415%. For Tmin, CatBoost1 achieved R = 0.941, NSE = 0.885, RMSE = 2.618 °C, MAE = 1.952 °C, WI = 0.969, LM = 0.709, EVS = 0.885, and APB = 54.360%. These findings demonstrate that boosting models, when combined with explainable AI techniques, offer a robust and transparent framework for temperature forecasting, supporting their application in climate risk management, agriculture, and energy planning. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cotton leaf diseases are common agricultural issues and multifaceted threats to millions of farmers worldwide. This study aims to provide an up-to-date approach to diagnosing diseases of cotton leaves using advanced DL (Deep Learning) that is accessible and actionable by farmers, bridging the gap between technology and agricultural practices. The key to this study was the construction of a diverse dataset comprising 5722 high-resolution images collected from three independent sources and further enriched with expert guidance in annotation. Advanced preprocessing was done, like denoising, sharpening, and color balancing, to increase the quality of images, while augmentation increased generalization and reduced overfitting. In it, COLD-12 is proposed, which has achieved a promising result by incorporating Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling with Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks for improved channel attention in its multi-level feature extraction. The training accuracy of the model was 99.94 %, and the validation accuracy was 99.24 %, which indicates that the model was robust with very low validation loss. The inner workings of the COLD-12 model were interpreted by using explainable AI techniques such as Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and Layer-CAM. It showed advantages compared to state-of-the-art models such as VGG16, VGG19, Xception, DenseNet121, and InceptionResNetV2.The impact of batch size, K-fold cross-validation, and preprocessing techniques was also explored, resulting in improved accuracy and interpretability. An interactive web tool was developed to bridge research and real-world applications, offering farmers a convenient assistant for diagnosing cotton leaf diseases, thus supporting sustainable farming initiatives. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study presents an explainable artificial intelligence model for predicting pile driving vibrations in Bangkok’s soft clay subsoil. A deep neural network was developed using 1,018 real-world pile driving measurements, encompassing various pile and hammer characteristics, sensor locations, and vibration measurement axes. The model achieved a mean absolute error of 0.276, outperforming traditional empirical methods and other machine learning approaches. SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis was employed to provide both global and local explanations of the model’s predictions. Global explanations revealed complex relationships between input features and peak particle velocity, with distance from the pile driving location emerging as the most influential factor. Local explanations enabled interpretation of individual predictions, allowing for targeted optimization of pile driving parameters. Nonlinear relationships and threshold effects were observed, providing new insights into vibration propagation in soft clay. A web-based application was developed to facilitate adoption by practicing engineers, offering both predictive capabilities and explanations for each prediction. This research contributes to geotechnical engineering by offering a more accurate, nuanced, and interpretable approach to predicting pile driving vibrations, with implications for optimizing construction practices and mitigating environmental impacts in urban areas. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Flanged reinforced concrete walls also known as H-shaped walls are frequently used in nuclear facilities and conventional buildings due to their substantial lateral strength and stiffness in both directions. These walls mostly fail in shear, and it is essential to accurately estimate their peak shear strength (V<inf>p</inf>). However, the provisions of existing building codes to determine peak shear strength have significant limitations such as exclusion of the influence of flanges and consideration of insufficient input parameters. Therefore, this study aimed to construct predictive models for H-shaped walls using machine learning techniques like Bagging Regressor (BR), Gene Expression Programming (GEP), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), based on data gathered from existing literature. The gathered data had twelve inputs including shear span ratio (h<inf>w</inf>/l<inf>w</inf>), the ratio of flange thickness to web thickness (t<inf>f</inf>/t<inf>w</inf>), and loading type (M) etc. Out of all the algorithms, only GEP depicted its output as an equation. The performance of the algorithms was checked using error metrices like Objective Function (OF), and coefficient of determination (R2) etc. which showed that XGB exhibited the highest accuracy having the testing R2 equal to 0.99. Additionally, shapely (SHAP), Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE), and partial dependence plots (PDP) analysis were employed which showed that flange length, loading type, and shear span ratio are some of the most contributing variables to determine V<inf>p</inf>. Furthermore, a graphical user interface (GUI) has been developed to efficiently compute V<inf>p</inf> of RC squat H-shaped walls to help professionals in the civil engineering industry. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Adequate control of shield machine parameters to ensure the safety and efficiency of shield construction is a difficult and complex problem. To address this problem, this paper proposes a hybrid intelligent optimization framework that combines interpretable machine learning, intelligent optimization algorithms, and multi-objective optimization and decision-making methods. The nonlinear relationship between the input parameters and ground settlement (GS) is fitted based on the light gradient boosting machine (LGBM), and the effect of the input parameters on GS is analysed based on SHapley additive exPlanation for further feature selection. Subsequently, the hyperparameters of LGBM were determined based on the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) to better fit the input–output relationship. On this basis, a multi-objective intelligent optimization model is established to solve the optimized operating parameters of shield machine by non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution to reduce GS and improve drilling efficiency. The results demonstrate that the SSA-LGBM model predicts GS with high accuracy, exhibiting an RMSE of 4.775, a VAF of 0.930 and an R2 of 0.931. These metrics collectively reflect the model's excellent performance in prediction accuracy, ability to explain data variability, and control of prediction bias. The multi-objective optimization model is effective in optimizing two objectives, and the improvement can reach up to 39.38%; at the same time, the model has high scalability and can also be applied to three or more objectives. The intelligent optimization framework for shield construction parameters proposed in this paper can generate the optimal parameter combinations for shield machine manipulation, and provide reference and guidance when there are conflicting optimization objectives. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding the determinants of urban transportation mode choice is crucial for developing efficient, sustainable, and green transit systems in metropolitan areas. This study proposes a comprehensive framework that integrates big data and machine learning techniques, leveraging a large dataset comprising over ten million trips to investigate the factors influencing transportation mode choice under clear competition during peak hours. We examine how travel attributes, land use, network centrality, and demographics shape the choices of subway, bus, taxi, and bike-share users. Employing oversampling and interpretable techniques, our analysis reveals that travel attributes significantly influence transportation mode choices, especially for public transportation. Additionally, the marginal effects of the features on mode choice are efficiently captured. Interaction effects between travel time and cost further highlight the complex trade-offs travelers make under different choice probabilities. The findings underscore the importance of integrating diverse data sources for a holistic understanding of urban transportation dynamics. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Accident severity prediction is a critical challenge in traffic safety management, emergency response, and urban mobility planning. Road accidents remain a leading cause of fatalities worldwide, yet existing accident analysis frameworks often lack predictive accuracy, interpretability, and real-time decision-making capabilities. Traditional statistical models fail to capture complex interactions between vehicle attributes, driver behavior, and environmental factors, limiting their effectiveness in accident severity assessment. This study addresses these gaps by developing an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework for accident severity prediction, leveraging machine learning models (Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine, and Naïve Bayes) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis to enhance model transparency. The dataset, sourced from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), consists of 7394 recorded crashes and incorporates key predictors such as airbag deployment, control devices, seatbelt usage, and driver demographics. Experimental results demonstrate that XGBoost outperforms other models, achieving the highest accuracy (80.8%), recall (80.8%), and F1-score (81.0%), making it the most reliable classifier for distinguishing between severe and non-severe accidents. SHAP analysis reveals that airbag deployment, seatbelt usage, and control devices significantly impact accident severity outcomes, providing valuable insights into policy-driven interventions and traffic management strategies. Despite its effectiveness, the study highlights limitations such as data imbalance, lack of real-time behavioral factors, and exclusion of non-fatal crashes, suggesting deep learning integration, real-time telematics, and hybrid AI models in future research. The proposed framework offers a data-driven approach to accident severity prediction, improving road safety policies, vehicle design enhancements, and emergency response efficiency. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The classification of surrounding rock mass is essential for characterizing rock properties and geological conditions in tunneling engineering. While numerous empirical rock mass classification systems have been proposed (e.g., rock mass rating system, rock structure rating system), they tend to heavily rely on engineers' experience, which is unfavorable for tunnel construction, particularly in deep-buried and ultralong tunnels. Alternatively, machine learning, i.e., artificial intelligence (AI), methods estimate the classification of the surrounding rock mass using certain readily available rock indices (e.g., volumetric joint count). However, most machine learning models are considered black box models, leading to unexplainable predictions. In addition, employing all measurements of readily available rock indices as input may lead to excessive model complexity and a reduction in generalization performance. In this case, a Gaussian process classification (GPC) approach combined with the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), Bayesian framework, and SHapley Additive exPlanations is proposed in this study for the probabilistic classification of the surrounding rock mass and selection of the optimal GPC model based on imbalanced and sparse measurement data. It is worth noting that the proposed method can also provide physics-informed explanations for the prediction and model class selection results and determine the significant input variables for each grade of the surrounding rock mass. A real-life example is employed to illustrate and validate the proposed approach. The results show that the F1 score of the optimal GPC model reaches 0.93, which is comparable with those of the GPC model with all input variables. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The demand for urban public transport is closely associated with the built environment, as analysed at both the city and neighbourhood levels. Although neighbourhood-level built environments have been studied thoroughly, city-level factors have received less attention. In this study, a machine learning framework is developed to explore the influence of multilevel factors on public transport commuting. A case study of 79 cities in mainland China reveals: (1) The highest accuracy was achieved by incorporating individual socioeconomic and commuting characteristics, and neighbourhood- and city-level built environments. (2) The cumulative importance of built environment factors exceeds 50%, with approximately half contributed by city-level variables. (3) All level factors exhibit nonlinear effects, with some variables displaying threshold effects. (4) Cities are classified into five distinct groups based on city-level variable effects. These findings highlight the necessity of incorporating multi-level factors into planning practices and targeted policy recommendations for different types of cities. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In industrial applications, the complexity of machine learning models often makes their decision-making processes difficult to interpret and lack transparency, particularly in the steel manufacturing sector. Understanding these processes is crucial for ensuring quality control, regulatory compliance, and gaining the trust of stakeholders. To address this issue, this paper proposes LE-FIS, a large language models (LLMs)-based Explainable Fuzzy Inference System to interpret black-box models for steel defect detection. The method introduces a locally trained, globally predicted deep detection approach (LTGP), which segments the image into small parts for local training and then tests on the entire image for steel defect detection. Then, LE-FIS is designed to explain the LTGP by automatically generating rules and membership functions, with a genetic algorithm (GA) used to optimize parameters. Furthermore, state-of-the-art LLMs are employed to interpret the results of LE-FIS, and evaluation metrics are established for comparison and analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that LTGP performs well in defect detection tasks, and LE-FIS supported by LLMs provides a trustworthy and interpretable model for steel defect detection, which enhances transparency and reliability in industrial environments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background and objective: Diagnosis of rare neuromuscular diseases often relies on muscle biopsy analysis, which varies based on the evaluator's experience. Advances in deep learning show promise in improving diagnostic accuracy by identifying standardized features and phenotypic expressions in biopsy images. Explainable artificial intelligence extracts these features from the neural network's “black box,” ensuring compliance with European ethical standards for the use of clinical data in real-world applications. This study proposes a clinic-friendly workflow, based on explainable artificial intelligence. It combines forward-forward and backpropagation-trained convolutional networks to identify complementary features of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Our proposal sets the forward-forward training, applied here for the first time on biomedical images, as a potential new standard for interpretable deep learning applications in clinics. Methods: We analyzed a multiphoton microscopy dataset of 1600 images from 16 human muscle biopsies obtained during elective spinal surgery, combining autofluorescence, second and third harmonic generation signals. Class Activation Maps unveiled the dual decision-making process of the convolutional network, independently trained with both standard backpropagation and forward-forward algorithms. We evaluated the significance of the discovered features by using the Mann Whitney method. Entire biopsies were analyzed by providing an attention metric, computed as the weighted mean of all significant parameters. Results: Backpropagation, gold standard for 35 years, and forward-forward achieved over 90 % accuracy in distinguishing healthy and diseased patients tissue. Class activation maps revealed that, when trained independently with both algorithms, the same network identifies Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy tissue by focusing on different features. Both methods identified intramuscular collagen as a key feature. Backpropagation also highlighted collagen waviness and fatty tissue. Forward-forward emphasized collagen density. We integrated these complementary insights, validated by significance analysis, into a standardized attention metric, allowing a multi-structural, quantitative assessment of tissue changes and highlighting areas for further clinical analysis. Conclusions: Our workflow, using clinically routine biopsies and transparent diagnostic features, demonstrates the unique potential of forward-forward in providing novel, reliable, interpretable results from biomedical images. This paves the way for its dual use with backpropagation, shifting benchmarks by enabling the discovery of features potentially overlooked by backpropagation across biomedical datasets. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper explores the advanced integration of predictive models in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) to improve post-procedural outcomes and address the risk of conduction abnormalities (CA), which frequently require permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI). We investigate critical considerations, from enhancing model reliability and interactivity for physicians to ensuring data confidentiality, advancing the development of intelligent healthcare solutions, and bridging the gap between technological innovation and practical medical application. To overcome data scarcity, we use a penalized gradient policy over the conditional generative adversarial networks (CGAN) as a solution for data augmentation. Furthermore, we present a unique tool to doctors for simulating and assessing probable surgical consequences: a digital twin framework for visualizing the requirement of pacemaker implantation post-TAVR. We aim to simplify complex predictions for healthcare practitioners by combining Explainable AI (XAI) with medical twins. Additionally, we have set up a roadmap for the TAVR navigator system that adheres to stringent ethical and legal criteria while respecting reliable AI features like validity, confidentiality, responsiveness, and privacy. It will guarantee that the development and implementation of our system focuses on ethics and transparency. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The remarkable advancements in machine learning (ML) have led to its extensive adoption in Project Risk Management (PRM), leveraging its powerful predictive capabilities and data-driven insights that support proactive decision-making. Nevertheless, the “black-box” nature of ML models obscures the reasoning behind predictions, undermining transparency and trust. To address this, existing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, such as Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), Global Priors-based LIME (G-LIME), and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), have been applied to interpret black-box models. Yet, they face considerable limitations in PRM, including their inability to model cascading effects and multi-level dependencies among risk factors, suffering from inconsistencies due to random sampling, and failure to capture non-linear interactions in high-dimensional risk data. In response to these shortcomings, this paper proposes the Multi-Module eXplainable Artificial Intelligence framework for Project Risk Management (MMXAI-PRM), a novel approach designed to address the unique demands of PRM. The framework consists of three modules: the Risk Relationship Insight Module (RRIM), which models risk dependencies using a Knowledge Graph (KG); the Risk Factor Influence Analysis Module (RFIAM), which introduces a Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network-aided Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations using Kernel Ridge Regression (CTGAN-LIME-KR) to ensure explanation consistency and handle non-linearity; and the Visualization and Interpretation Module (VIM), which synthesizes these insights into an interpretable, chain-based representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MMXAI-PRM delivers more consistent, stable, and accurate explanations than existing XAI methods. By improving interpretability, it enhances trust in AI-driven risk predictions and equips project managers with actionable insights, advancing decision-making in PRM. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Human mobility exerts significant influences on urban air pollution. Regrettably, most existing studies treated mobility as a homogeneous entity, neglecting that its effects may vary by travel purposes due to distinct spatiotemporal patterns. To address this gap, this study utilizes a trip purpose inference algorithm to classify mobility based on Beijing's three-month taxi trajectory data and examines its impact on air pollution using interpretable XGBoost-SHAP models. The correlational analysis indicates the substantial contribution of wind, temperature, and precipitation to air pollution. Human mobility's contribution is less significant than the abovementioned natural environments but greater than built environments, such as building density and height. In the long term, the negative correlation between work- and home-purpose mobility and pollution challenges the assumption that more mobility always increases pollution. Based on the case study in Beijing, this research eventually proposed possible practical implications and suggestions for sustainable urban planning and management, including promoting mixed-use development and work-residence integration, creating urban wind corridors and open green spaces, and adopting low-emission transportation while avoiding blanket traffic restrictions. This study uses interpretable machine learning models to clarify complex variable relationships, while future research could explore causality to better understand the underlying mechanisms. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cement-based materials in urban buildings can absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide through carbonation, presenting substantial potential for urban carbon sequestration. Accurately estimating and interpreting the carbon sink capacity of urban buildings is essential for effective urban carbon management. In this study, we develop an interpretable machine learning framework that integrates a multilayer perceptron neural network with Shapley additive explanation methods and a causal forest model to quantify building carbon sinks in the central urban area of Guiyang, China. The results indicate that this region's total carbon sequestered by buildings is approximately 1.822 million metric tons. Residential buildings account for about 68.2 % of the total carbon sink among different building types. The Shapley additive explanations analysis identifies building volume, footprint area, and perimeter as the most influential predictive variables. However, the causal forest analysis further reveals that building height and slope have the most potent direct causal effects, highlighting key structural factors influencing carbon sequestration. The significant discrepancy between predictive importance and causal contribution underscores the need to incorporate causal reasoning into urban carbon management strategies. These findings provide a robust methodological foundation for accurately assessing building-related carbon sinks and offer critical insights for sustainable urban planning and carbon neutrality strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) offers promising advancements in enhancing transparency and usability of AI-based Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) in healthcare settings. These tools aim to improve clinical outcomes by assisting with diagnosis, treatment planning, and risk prediction. However, integrating XAI into clinical workflows requires effective involvement of healthcare professionals to ensure that the explanations provided by these tools are comprehensible, relevant, and actionable. This scoping review aimed to investigate how (potential) end users were involved in the design and development of XAI-based CDSS for hospitals. A systematic search of Medline, Embase, and Web of Science identified 11 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Interviews and focus groups, mainly with physicians, were common, while some included nurses and developers. Four of the 11 studies engaged users across multiple stages, from pre-design to prototype testing, and specifically tested different explanation techniques with end-users. A quality assessment of papers found some studies had unclear recruitment strategies and insufficiently detailed analyses. Future work should engage end-users early in the design process, include health professionals with diverse experiences and backgrounds, and test explanation techniques to ensure appropriate methods that align with cognitive processes are chosen. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The dynamic patterns of leisure jogging profile the jogger-environment interactions. However, the dynamic patterns and their nonlinear associations with environmental factors are poorly explored. Therefore, we develop a framework to uncover the dynamic jogging patterns and interpret their nonlinear and interactive associations with environments. Initially, the bivariate time series clustering method discerns daily and weekly patterns from the integrated jogging flow and duration. Then, interpretable machine learning methods including CatBoost, SHAP, and ALE plots elucidate the nonlinear and interactive relationships. An empirical analysis of Beijing, China was conducted using multisource data. Our finding highlights that (1) five distinct daily and weekly jogging patterns were investigated for area zoning. These patterns show notable spatial-temporal disparities in jogging flow and duration. (2) Built environment (BE) and visual environment are crucial in shaping jogging, with accessibility and facilities being significant contributors. (3) Environmental variables show significant nonlinear and threshold effects on leisure jogging, which vary across jogging patterns and urban areas. (4) Interaction effects among environmental factors were investigated. BE factors like sports amenity exert more significant interactions. Importantly, incorporating geographic locations enhances model performance as it captures spatial effects. These findings can help planners design refined intervention strategies for leisure activities. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Machine learning and deep learning have significantly enhanced the ability to mitigate risks in blast-based tunnel construction. However, most studies fall short in model constraints, data quality, and explainability, making non-robust risk mitigation strategies. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the following questions: how to accurately assess risk for blast-based tunnel construction using limited data, and develop effective risk mitigation strategies? This research leverages counterfactual explanation generation, a key technique of explainable artificial intelligence, along with data augmentation to develop a framework for guiding risk mitigation, which includes: (1) a two-stage data augmentation technique to address data shortage and imbalance; (2) a novel counterfactual explanation generation algorithm to optimize blasting parameters and reduce risk; and (3) a post-hoc explainable approach to provide insights on feature importance. A railway tunnel in Hubei is conducted as a case study to test the validity of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method accurately predict overbreak, achieving the highest R2 (0.883) and the lowest RMSE (1.335) compared to baseline models. Additionally, it effectively optimizes the blasting parameters to mitigate risk, reducing the average overbreak in six scenarios. The explainable analytic identifies key factors (e.g., periphery hole spacing) influencing construction risk, thereby enhancing personnel's understanding of complex construction systems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Pest management plays a pivotal role in ensuring sustainable crop productivity. Integrated Pest Management Systems (IPMS) gaining importance due to the need for more sustainable agricultural methods. However, implementing standard pest management practices on a large scale is challenging due to their time-consuming and labor-intensive nature. In order to enhance pest management efficiency in date palm cultivation, this research paper proposes an Artificial Intelligence-driven Pest Prediction System, explicitly targeting the Parlatoria Date Scale (PDS), a significant pest affecting date palms. The approach leverages climatological factors to predict the occurrence of PDS nymphs and adult females. To address the challenges of data scarcity and imbalance, the Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling for Regression using Gaussian Noise (SMOGN) method is employed, which significantly enhances the dataset's utility for training machine learning models. The interpretability of these models is further enhanced using SHAP values, providing insights into the driving factors behind the predictions and facilitating trust and understanding in the AI-driven decision-making process. The Stacking-based Weighted Ensemble model stands out among the evaluated ensemble-based methods, achieving R2 scores of 77%, 88%, and 90% for predicting PDS nymphs, adult females, and total population incidence, respectively. This research highlights the potential of AI in revolutionizing Date Palm Integrated Pest Management Systems (IPMS). It emphasizes the importance of model interpretability in adopting AI solutions to enhance the precision and effectiveness of pest management practices, thereby promoting a more sustainable agricultural system. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Mango productivity suffers greatly from leaf diseases, leading to economic and food security issues. Current visual inspection methods are slow and subjective. Previous Deep-Learning (DL) solutions have shown promise but suffer from imbalanced datasets, modest generalization, and limited interpretability. To address these challenges, this study introduces the ViX-MangoEFormer, which combines convolutional kernels and self-attention to effectively diagnose multiple mango leaf conditions in both balanced and imbalanced image sets. To benchmark against ViX-MangoEFormer, we developed a stacking ensemble model (MangoNet-Stack) that utilizes five transfer learning networks as base learners. All models were trained with Grad-CAM produced pixel-level explanations. In a combined dataset of 25,530 images, ViX-MangoEFormer achieved an F1 score of 99.78% and a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 99.34%. This performance consistently outperformed individual pre-trained models and MangoNet-Stack. Additionally, data augmentation has improved the performance of every architecture compared to its non-augmented version. Cross-domain tests on morphologically similar crop leaves confirmed strong generalization. Our findings validate the effectiveness of transformer attention and XAI in mango leaf disease detection. ViX-MangoEFormer is deployed as a web application that delivers real-time predictions, probability scores, and visual rationales. The system enables growers to respond quickly and enhances large-scale smart crop health monitoring. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This systematic literature review (SLR) provides a comprehensive application-wise analysis of machine learning (ML)-driven predictive maintenance (PdM) across industrial domains. Motivated by the digital transformation of industry 4.0, this study explores how ML techniques optimize maintenance by predicting faults, estimating remaining useful life (RUL), and reducing operational downtime. Sixty peer-reviewed articles published between 2020 and 2024 were selected using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines, and were analyzed based on industrial sector, ML techniques, datasets, evaluation metrics, and implementation challenges. Results show that combining ML with diverse sensor data enhances predictive performance under varying operational conditions across manufacturing, energy, healthcare, and transportation. Frequently used open datasets include the commercial modular aero-propulsion system simulation (CMAPSS), the malfunctioning industrial machine investigation and inspection (MIMII), and the semiconductor manufacturing process (SECOM) datasets, though data heterogeneity and imbalance remain major barriers. Emerging paradigms such as hybrid modeling, digital twins, and physics-informed learning show promise but face issues like computational cost, interpretability, and limited scalability. The findings highlight future research needs in model generalizability, real-world validation, and explainable artificial intelligence (AI) to bridge gaps between ML innovations and industrial practice. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The built environment has been widely recognized as a critical determinant of physical activity among older adults. However, urban–rural disparities and the non-linear effects of environmental features remain underexplored. Using interpretable machine learning (random forest model) on nationwide representative data from 2526 older adults in the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) database, this study identified both common and distinct risk factors for insufficient moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) across diverse urban and rural contexts. The results revealed a location-based gradient in physical activity insufficiency: rural areas < suburban areas < central urban areas. Rural older adults faced greater constraints from safety concerns and transportation accessibility limitations. In comparison, urban older adults would benefit from targeted improvements in built environment quality, particularly elevator accessibility and diverse public activity spaces. Furthermore, non-linear relationships were observed between built environment features and physical activity, elucidating the “density paradox”: while moderate urban compactness promoted active behaviors, excessive density (>24,000 persons/km2), perceived overcrowding, and over-proximity to specific facilities (<1 km) were linked to reduced MVPA. These findings underscore the necessity for differentiated policy interventions in urban and rural settings to address the distinct environmental needs of older adults. Meanwhile, in urban planning, it is crucial that we balance spatial compactness and functional diversity within optimal thresholds for creating sustainable and inclusive built environments. Although a compact design may enhance mobility, equal attention must be paid to preventing spatial disorder from over-densification. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Clarifying the mechanisms by which the micro-scale built environment influences urban vitality is an important scientific challenge, to guide precise urban planning in the context of urban renewal. In this study, we quantify the intensity of human activities through Baidu heat maps, analyze social interaction patterns using social media check-in data, and integrate built environment elements such as road network topology, 3D building morphology, and the spatial distribution of points of interest (POIs). A machine learning technique combining a real-encoded Accelerated Genetic Algorithm-Projective Pathfinding Model (RAGA-PPM) and Shapley Additive Projection for Interpretability (SHAP) for Interpretability Analysis (IPA) was used to investigate the nonlinear mechanisms of 17 factors affecting urban vitality in Macau Peninsula, China. Firstly, the explanatory power of the built environment for comprehensive vitality was significantly better than the other dimensions. Two factors, population vitality and microblogging check-in vitality, contributed the most to the composite vitality value. Secondly, road network density was the most important built environment factor affecting urban vitality in Macau Peninsula (SHAP = 0.025). Finally, the impacts of built environment factors on urban vitality showed nonlinearities, and the threshold effects of the core factors (road network density, spatial fractal dimension, and openness to the sky) showed a consistent neighborhood-level pattern. This study establishes a framework for micro-vitality mechanisms in high-density cities, addressing the limitations of traditional methods in modeling complex nonlinear relationships. The methodological integration of RAGA-PPM and SHAP advances the innovative paradigm of applying interpretable machine learning to the study of urban form. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Optimizing the built environment to foster urban vitality is essential for effective urban planning and sustainable development. Previous studies have predominantly focused on analyzing the relationship between the built environment and urban vitality at either a macro or micro-scale, often assuming a predefined linear relationship. In this study, we investigate the potential non-linear interactions between the built environment and urban vitality by employing an interpretable spatial machine learning framework that integrates the XGBoost model with the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm. Additionally, we analyze the determinants of urban vitality across both micro and macro-scales using multi-source data, semantic segmentation models, and street view imagery. Our findings reveal the following key insights: (1) the distribution of urban vitality exhibits spatial heterogeneity within the main urban area of Shanghai, with high vitality areas concentrated in the Huangpu District and at intersections with neighboring districts, demonstrating a decline from the center to the periphery; (2) the XGBoost model outperforms other comparative models, showcasing superior capabilities in simulating and predicting urban vitality; (3) among the various built environment factors influencing urban vitality, building coverage, population density, and distance to the CBD exert the most significant effects, while the green view index and the number of bus stops contribute relatively less; (4) all built environment factors demonstrate nonlinear impacts and exhibit certain threshold effects on urban vitality. The analytical outcomes of this study provide valuable insights for optimizing the spatial layout and resource allocation within urban settings, offering references for urban planning and sustainable development initiatives. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Deep learning (DL) is reshaping mechanical engineering by offering advanced capabilities for solving complex problems, particularly in fault diagnosis, predictive maintenance, and materials science. While conventional machine learning and physics-based approaches remain prevalent, DL models provide superior performance in terms of accuracy, automation, and adaptability. This systematic review investigates trends in DL applications within mechanical engineering from 2015 to 2024. An initial search using the query “deep learning AND mechanical engineering” across seven major databases—Google Scholar, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, ERIC, Science Direct, Compendex, and Wiley Online Library—yielded 149 articles. After applying exclusion criteria (published before 2014, non-English, short or work-in-progress papers, not DL and/or mechanical engineering focus, or conceptual papers), 49 studies were selected for in-depth analysis. The results indicate that DL models improve prediction accuracy by 10%–35% over traditional techniques across various applications, including fault detection in rotating machinery and microstructural analysis in materials engineering. Despite notable gains, challenges persist related to data availability, computational intensity, and model interpretability. This review highlights the importance of addressing these limitations and recommends future research efforts toward improving model generalization, incorporating explainable AI techniques, and optimizing DL deployment under limited-data scenarios. Furthermore, the integration of DL with Industry 4.0 technologies—such as IoT, digital twins, and cyber-physical systems—presents a promising direction for real-time, intelligent decision-making in mechanical engineering systems. This review serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to apply or advance DL methods in mechanical engineering contexts. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Traditionally, ASR expansion is determined using experimental and finite element method (FEM) based numerical modelling. However, these methods are time-consuming and computationally costly, which makes ASR prediction challenging. Machine learning (ML) techniques can serve as effective alternatives for the early detection of expansion in concrete structures. In this study, we developed four different machine learning models – extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) to predict the ASR expansion in concrete using a comprehensive dataset with 1896 data points. Each model was evaluated based on the model performance and XGBoost shows the most effective model for predicting the ASR expansion with R2 of 0.99 for training and R2 of 0.98 for testing. After identifying the best-performing model, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) were employed to interpret its predictions. This approach provides insights into the model’s decision-making process, clarifying the complex nature of machine learning algorithms. Using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), time and the average size of reactive aggregate were identified as critical parameters influencing ASR expansion. This research holds significant value for the construction industry, as accurately predicting ASR expansion can lead to optimized material usage and improved structural performance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Recent studies focus on machine learning (ML) algorithms for predicting employee churn (ECn) to save probable economic loss, technology leakage, and customer and knowledge transference. However, can human resource professionals rely on algorithms for prediction? Can they decide when the process of prediction is not known? Due to the lack of interpretability, ML models' exclusive nature and growing intricacy make it challenging for field experts to comprehend these multifaceted black boxes. To address the concern of interpretability, trust and transparency of black-box predictions, this study explores the application of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in identifying the factors that escalate the ECn, analysing the negative impact on productivity, employee morale and financial stability. We propose a predictive model that compares the best two top-performing algorithms based on the performance metrics. Thereafter, we suggest applying an explainable artificial intelligence based on Shapley values, i.e., the Shapley Additive exPlanations approach (SHAP), to identify and compare the feature importance of top-performing algorithms logistic regression and random forest analysis on our dataset. The interpretability of the predictive outcome unboxes the predictions, enhancing trust and facilitating retention strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - While global vegetation shows widespread greening under climate change, the corresponding impacts on Net Ecosystem Production (NEP)—particularly the divergent responses between drylands and non-drylands—remain poorly understood. In this study, based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF), Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), and NEP, we analyzed the spatiotemporal dynamics of vegetation photosynthesis and NEP across Eurasia from 1982 to 2018, and explored their differential responses to environmental factors, with particular focus on the contrasting mechanisms between drylands and non-drylands. The results showed that the rate of increase in NEP standardized anomalies (0.004 yr−1, p < 0.05) lagged behind NDVI/SIF/GPP standardized anomalies (0.009 − 0.014 yr−1, p < 0.01), particularly after 2000, and it was more pronounced in drylands. Spatially, vegetation photosynthesis and NEP changed asynchronously in nearly one-third of Eurasia, with a slightly higher proportion in non-dryland areas and the most obvious patterns in forests and croplands. Explainable machine learning analysis revealed that this asynchrony was primarily driven by interactions among temperature, vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and evapotranspiration. Vegetation photosynthesis was mainly influenced by evapotranspiration, while NEP was constrained by increased VPD. Moreover, in drylands, NEP was highly sensitive to atmospheric moisture, whereas in non-drylands, temperature fluctuations played a dominant role. These findings offer important insights for regional carbon sequestration management and climate change adaptation strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) in smart factories enhances management through real-time monitoring and data analytics, while Artificial Intelligence (AI) automates processes and boosts efficiency. However, AI systems require vast amounts of data and substantial training time, facing challenges such as domain discrepancies, limited labeled data, negative transfer, sample selection bias, and computational complexity. Additionally, the opaque nature of AI models raises transparency issues, making it difficult for human operators to trust and interpret AI decisions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an IoT-based safety management scheme for smart factories, utilizing advanced technologies to enhance safety and operational efficiency. The proposed approach integrates robust deep learning (DL) models developed through big transfer learning (BiTL) and is augmented with explainable AI (XAI) to ensure transparency and reliability in safety management. The major contributions of this work include designing a comprehensive IoT-based safety framework, conducting a detailed case study to optimize DL model performance using BiTL, and establishing an experimental environment for thorough validation. The findings demonstrate that the proposed system not only meets but also exceeds the performance of existing safety management solutions, offering a transparent, trustworthy, and highly effective AI-driven safety management system for modern smart factories. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Fault diagnosis of the fan in steelmaking shops has significant practical value in guaranteeing smooth operation and achieving quality control of steel coils. The existing data-driven systems, mainly deep neural network-based diagnostic models, have achieved some success in recognizing fan faults. However, these models face a significant challenge in reaching reliable diagnostic conclusions with uncertainty due to the absence of interpretable representations between fault labels and features. To address this issue, this paper develops and evaluates an interpretable model, namely Stacked Logic Denoising Auto-Encoders (SLDAE). SLDAE is a flexible neural-symbolic system that extracts confidence rules and Binary Decision Logic (BDL) rules to explain how SDAE conducts feature learning, and conducts uncertain reasoning of diagnostic decision-making. To extract confidence rules, a logic grouping DAE is designed to consider the impact of different literals on neuron activation so as to reduce information loss. To extract BDL rules, we design a novel network structure, Discrete Logic Networks (DLNs), to facilitate extracting implicit relationships between fault features and labels while learning and representing the belief of BDL rules. Experiments verified on two fan datasets indicate that SLDAE can perform quantitative reasoning of uncertain diagnostic logic and exhibits a notable performance in fault recognition. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Accurate air quality forecasting is essential for urban management and public health, yet it remains challenging due to the complexity of spatiotemporal air pollution dynamics and the interplay of static and dynamic urban factors. Traditional models often neglect the influence of static urban drivers, such as built environment features, which are critical to understanding pollution patterns. Addressing this limitation, we propose a multi-view, multi-modal Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (STGNN) framework that integrates dynamic pollution data with static urban environmental semantics to improve predictive performance and interpretability. By embedding static features, such as Points of Interest (POIs), into the graph structure and leveraging a self-attention mechanism, our model captures complex spatial dependencies and temporal dynamics. Furthermore, an integrated Explainer module enhances transparency by revealing the spatial and feature-level influences driving air quality predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach not only achieves superior predictive accuracy compared to benchmark models but also provides actionable insights into the relationships between urban features and air quality. This study highlights the importance of integrating multi-modal data and interpretability in advancing air quality prediction, offering valuable implications for urban planning and pollution mitigation strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Explainable AI (XAI) is concerned with how to make AI models more understandable to people. To date these explanations have predominantly been technocentric - mechanistic or productivity oriented. This paper introduces the Explainable AI for the Arts (XAIxArts) manifesto to provoke new ways of thinking about explainability and AI beyond technocentric discourses. Manifestos offer a means to communicate ideas, amplify unheard voices, and foster reflection on practice. To supports the co-creation and revision of the XAIxArts manifesto we combine a World Café style discussion format with a living manifesto to question four core themes: 1) Empowerment, Inclusion, and Fairness; 2) Valuing Artistic Practice; 3) Hacking and Glitches; and 4) Openness. Through our interactive living manifesto experience we invite participants to actively engage in shaping this XIAxArts vision within the CHI community and beyond. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The in-situ material shortage and high geothermal service conditions significantly hinder the utilization of shotcrete for the construction of tunnels in plateau regions. In this study, fully tunnel muck-based shotcrete (FTMS) was developed using stone powder and sand-gravel aggregates derived from tunnel muck. The effects of stone powder content, stone powder modification methods, and six performance-reinforcing materials on the high-geothermal resistance of FTMS were systematically investigated. The results demonstrated that a stone powder content of 20 % and a modification ratio of stone powder:silica fume:modifier = 82:15:3 achieved an optimal balance between stone powder utilization and high-geothermal performance. The improvement effect of calcium carbonate whiskers on the compressive strength of FTMS under high geothermal conditions was most significant, while the optimization effect of nano alumina sol on compressive strength and mass loss rate was most prominent. The influence of dual-doped performance-reinforcing materials on three properties was predicted using artificial neural networks, and interpretability analysis was conducted using SHAP. Finally, the optimal combination strategy was determined to be the co-doping of nano alumina sol and calcium carbonate whiskers. Microstructural analysis revealed that the addition of nanomaterials forms a dense calcium carbonate network in FTMS, while promoting the secondary hydration of calcium hydroxide, resulting in high-strength hydration products such as monocarboaluminate and ettringite. Additionally, a significant transformation of C-S-H to C-A-S-H phases was observed, accompanied by a 36.6 % reduction in harmful pores. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - There are numerous studies examining the impact of morphological characteristics on the energy performance of buildings. However, there are a limited number of studies that investigate energy consumption in relation to urban forms across metropolitan areas using big data and AI techniques. This study aims to evaluate the energy performance of different urban forms based on their morphological characteristics in Istanbul, employing AI driven methods. In the study, the energy performance certificates of 36,901 buildings, selected through a data preprocessing process, were used to accurately represent different residential typologies. Among eight different machine learning techniques that tested both linear and nonlinear relationships among variables, the most successful results were obtained from techniques based on decision trees that capture nonlinear relationships. Among these techniques, the Random Forest model demonstrated the highest predictive performance, achieving an R-squared score of 77%. The influence of variables was further analyzed using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), revealing that total construction area and building compactness were the most influential variables in model predictions. This approach also enabled the identification of critical threshold values of these variables affecting energy consumption. Additionally, geometric variables were employed as predictor variables in AI models to estimate energy consumption for 713,648 buildings lacking available data. In another phase of the study, clustering analysis was performed to classify 51,862 building blocks into seven distinct urban form types. The estimated energy consumption data of buildings were integrated with the classified building block data to systematically examine the energy performance of different urban forms. As a result, among the seven different urban forms, ’open skyscraper’ was identified as the most efficient in terms of energy performance, while ’irregular compact low-rise’ was determined to be the least efficient. The study contributes to supporting research in energy-efficient urban planning through the application of AI techniques in both analysis and modelling. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Residential buildings are important contributors to building energy consumption. Occupants' energy-saving behaviors and cognition have significant impacts on building energy saving, which are often influenced by factors such as group and environment, especially in shared residential spaces. Several studies have examined factors influencing energy-saving behaviors, highlighting a significant gap between these behaviors and individuals' cognition regarding energy conservation. However, why such a gap exists have not been well explored. This research aims to identify and assess factors influencing occupants' energy-saving cognition-behavior gaps in shared residential spaces, using university dormitories as a case study. By comparing five interpretable machine learning algorithms, Random Forest was found to be the optimal algorithm. The contribution of different factors to the model was explained through SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Results show that compared with individual dimension factors, interaction dimension factors such as willingness to responding to cultural measures had a more important influence on energy-saving cognition-behavior gaps. Factors exhibited the importance variability across four groups of occupants. Management strategies designed to bridge energy-saving cognition-behavior gaps for each occupant group were proposed accordingly. This research innovatively proposed a new perspective of separating energy-saving cognition and behavior to explore influencing factors of occupants' energy conservation. Furthermore, this research provided valuable insights for building managers to develop tailored energy-saving strategies aligned with occupants’ cognitive and behavioural differences. By addressing these variations, managers can implement targeted interventions to enhance energy efficiency, optimize facility operations, and foster greater occupant engagement - key to advancing sustainability in the built environment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Recent advancements in machine learning enable accurate prediction of concrete's mechanical properties, offering efficiency in data analysis and reducing material waste in civil engineering. What sets this study apart from the literature is the simultaneous prediction of Compressive, Tensile, and Flexural Strength for reinforced concrete (SFRC). This integrated prediction could streamline the material selection process, enhance the durability of concrete structures, and improve performance in real-world applications such as pavements, bridges, and industrial floors. Unique variables like fiber length and content are among the input variables for predictions, which may lead to more cost-effective structural solutions. In this study, base models of the Ridge Regression and Quantile Regression were cross-validated, and the best folds of the compiled dataset for training and testing models were selected. The Sled Dog Optimizer, as a recently developed strong optimization algorithm, is utilized for fine-tuning hyperparameters of the models and enhancing prediction performance. Also, the Bayesian model combination method was employed to develop a hybrid ensemble model for reliably predicting concrete strengths by combining the capabilities of both hybrid models. Such hybrid and ensemble models are rare in the literature in this field. Also, SHAP-based explainable AI utilized for interpreting importance of variables in predictions. The hybrid ensemble model performed best in predicting Compressive Strength, achieving the lowest RMSE (3.295 MPa) and highest R² (0.974). For Flexural and Tensile Strength, it attained R² values of 0.986 and 0.974, respectively, with 90 % and 100 % of predictions showing errors below 10 %. Among hybrid models, RRSD excelled, with R² values of 0.94 for Compressive Strength and 0.98 for Flexural and Tensile Strength. These results demonstrate the reliability of machine learning for modeling SFRC properties. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study explores the influence of high-volume eco-binders, including ground granulated blast furnace slag (BFS) and fly ash (FLA), on the performance of high-performance concrete (HPC) through physical-data dual drive. Initially, the basic properties of the mixtures are assessed via compressive strength and slump tests. Nanoindentation experiments are conducted to examine the interfacial transition zone (ITZ) properties. The findings indicate that mixtures incorporating BFS or FLA demonstrate optimal improvements in compressive strength, flowability, and ITZ performance at substitution rates between 10 % and 30 % under the same curing conditions. However, substitution rates of 50 % or higher result in reduced performance. Machine learning techniques play a central role in this research because they can accurately predict specific properties. Data distribution analysis is utilized to guide the development of ensemble learning models. The integration of SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) enhances model interpretability. XGBoost outperforms traditional models, including LR, BP, KNN, SVR, and ANN. Specifically, XGBoost achieves an RMSE of 4.557, MAE of 2.687, MAPE of 8.647 %, and R² of 0.929 for compressive strength, and an RMSE of 3.495, MAE of 1.405, MAPE of 0.938 %, and R² of 0.968 for flowability. SHAP analysis identifies Age and Admixtures as the most significant factors influencing both compressive strength and flowability in HPC. This study provides valuable insights into improving the performance of eco-binder high-performance concrete, demonstrating the potential of machine learning in predicting and optimizing concrete performance and offering a data-driven approach to support the sustainable development of eco-friendly construction materials. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Research methods for mitigating urban heat islands (UHIs) have been widely documented. Nevertheless, the importance of mitigating UHIs through landscape allocation in urban-rural transition zones (URTZs) has rarely been emphasized in the context of intra-urban land scarcity and urban expansion in China. This study aimed to quantify the binary relationship between URTZ's landscape configuration and urban heat island intensity (UHII) by using an interpretable ensemble learning framework in Harbin, a megacity in China. After URTZ's identification, this study integrated Boruta algorithm, SHAP, ALE (interpretable machine learning techniques) and 7 tree-based machine learning models to assess the importance of URTZ's landscape configuration with both global and local angles. The results indicated that: construction land contributed most, with construction land ratio (23.20 %), separation degree (15.95 %), and maximum patch index (15.03 %) ranking highest. This was followed by agricultural land landscape shape index (10.31 %) and landscape diversity (9 %). Maintaining construction land ratio at 50–70 % can keep UHII unchanged; UHII at the grid landscape level can be alleviated when separation degree between construction land patches was above 0.7. The largest construction land patch within the grid was maintained at 20–40 or 50–70, which will not bring significant changes to UHII. The agricultural land landscape shape should be as simple as possible to reduce UHII; landscape diversity greater than 0.6 can reduce UHII, and <0.6 can increase UHII. These findings provide valuable insights into UHI mitigation and offer strategic guidance for ecological planning to promote sustainable development of large cities in rapidly changing URTZs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - One of the main challenges in reinforced concrete with rebars is the bond strength between the rebars and the concrete in flexural elements. Various studies have been conducted on the effect of different parameters on bond strength. However, the simultaneous effect of these factors under specific conditions remains ambiguous, requiring further tests which are time-consuming and costly. Bringing together several reported data up to now and obtaining a comprehensive output would be valuable. A comprehensive dataset was constructed from 268 data points reported in 19 studies, encapsulating various parameters such as type of reinforcement, concrete strength, embedment length, and environmental conditions. Four machine learning (ML) models, including Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), were applied and optimized through grid search. The XGB model demonstrated superior predictive accuracy, achieving an R² score of 0.9 post-tuning, underscoring the effectiveness of hyperparameter optimization. Shapley values were utilized to interpret model predictions, highlighting embedment length, concrete compressive strength, and bar size as the most influential features. ML models offer a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative to extensive experimental testing and pave the way for integrating advanced computational techniques in civil engineering to enhance the design and durability of reinforced concrete structures. Eventually, an intuitive and user-friendly interface (UI) model, which eliminates the need for terminal commands and coding, has been developed, accessible on GitHub, and recommended for design practices. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cyber-physical systems (CPS) security is critical, particularly with the advent of Industry 5.0, which seeks to revolutionize industrial ecosystems through enhanced automation, connectivity, and human-machine collaboration. While this shift promises increased efficiency and productivity, it exposes systems to advanced cyber threats. This paper introduces Cyber-Sentinet, a Deep Learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) designed explicitly for CPS in industrial IoT environments to address these challenges. Unlike traditional IDS models, Cyber-Sentinet integrates Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to enhance the interpretability of its decision-making process, allowing security experts to understand better and trust the system's detections. Rigorous experimentation on the Edge-IIoT-2022 dataset, which covers various cyber-attacks (e.g., DDoS, SQL injection, MITM), validates Cyber-Sentinet effectiveness. The model achieves an accuracy of 97.46 %, precision of 97.7 %, and recall of 97.2 %, with a low loss of 0.182. These results demonstrate Cyber-Sentinet ability to offer high-performance intrusion detection and valuable insights into network security, making it a robust solution for protecting Industry 5.0 CPS against sophisticated cyber threats. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding the factors influencing truck emissions remains critical for sustainable urban freight transport development. However, ignoring spatiotemporal and policy heterogeneity may lead to inaccurate predictions for specific regions and misinterpretation of outcomes. This study develops a comprehensive framework to analyze the nonlinear effects of the built environment on heavy-duty diesel truck emissions, utilizing large-scale GPS data from Shanghai, China. We introduce an interpretable predictive model that integrates random effects with a light gradient boosting machine to account for spatiotemporal and policy influences. The results show that proposed model outperforms baseline by 15 %–20 %, with an improvement exceeding 17 % in the more complex tasks of localized predictions in central urban areas. Land use and road design factors contribute 72.26 % to truck emissions, with industrial land density as the primary driver. Furthermore, the relationship between these factors and pollution emissions exhibits pronounced non-linearity, with threshold effects that vary under various policy restrictions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding the complex correlation between the built environment and subway passenger flow can provide unique insights for the development of transportation operations and urban coordination policies. Few studies have systematically analyzed the rationality of selecting built environment variables and further explored the non-linear relationships. In this study, we integrated various sources of built environmental factors and developed an interpretable machine learning analysis framework using backward elimination extreme gradient boosting and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values analysis (BE-XGBoost-SHAP). The framework was validated by analyzing passenger flows during the morning peak, non-peak, and evening peak periods at the station level. The research results indicate that there are significant differences between built environment factors and the time-varying passenger flow. Land use characteristics significantly dominate across all three temporal periods. The importance of other variable types in relation to passenger flows varies significantly across the three time periods. It is worth noting that the relationships between all variables and passenger flow at different time periods are non-linear, with the majority displaying threshold effects. Compared with the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) and ordinary least squares (OLS) models, the proposed interpretive framework performs better as regards R-square, root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) metrics. This study offers valuable insights, elucidating the pivotal land use attributes that notably affect passenger flow, the significance of varied built environment factors across distinct time spans, and the acknowledgment of non-linearities and threshold effects within these relationships. These findings are imperative for urban planning and the enhancement of station area design. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Existing empirical models for predicting the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of cement-treated soils (CTS) are based on specific soil–cement types and a limited set of strength-controlling factors (e.g., soil properties, compaction, curing, binder dosage, etc.). While machine learning models in the literature incorporate a broader range of these factors as input features, they tend to focus on improving prediction accuracy with less emphasis on offering insights into the relative importance of these factors. This research aims at deciphering the strength development in CTS by quantitatively accessing the relative importance of strength-controlling factors and identifying the dependencies between these factors using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). A comprehensive database of CTS was collected from the literature, covering a wide range of soil and cement types. A high-performance grid-search-optimized XGB model was developed with features related to soil classification, compaction conditions, cement types and dosage, curing time, and porosity to volumetric cement content ratio (η/C<inf>iv</inf>) used as input features to predict the UCS. The model's reliability is evidenced by its good generalization capability on an independently generated laboratory dataset. Furthermore, the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) helped in identifying the most influential parameters for UCS. SHAP feature dependence analysis further revealed interactions and dependencies between features, providing a deeper understanding of factors affecting the UCS. While compaction parameters were not ranked high individually, many features showed significant interaction and dependence on these parameters. These dependencies motivated developing design charts aimed at optimizing the UCS through compaction parameters. Consequently, innovative design charts were developed using artificially generated dataset, providing the possible combinations of dry density and water content to achieve the desired strength at fixed cement dosage, hence offering effective and cost-efficient solutions to soil stabilization projects. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Steel circular hollow section (CHS) members are widely utilized as axial force-resisting structural members in civil engineering structures. The buckling strength under axial loads is one of the critical parameters to determine the performance of the steel CHS members, which is significantly affected by the discreteness introduced by geometries, material, and initial imperfections. However, the reduction factor employed in the modern design codes (i.e. Chinese codes and EC3) only accounts for the reduction caused by all kinds of discreteness and does not reflect the impacts of every single discreteness and imperfection. To fill the gap, this paper proposed an interpretable machine-learning method to provide the probabilistic axial buckling strength of steel CHS members prediction result in a distribution form with the consideration of detailed discreteness. The model to predict the nominal axial buckling strength of steel CHS members was first developed utilizing ten machine learning algorithms after sufficient numerical simulations, where the numerical model was verified using test results. The artificial neural network (ANN) was selected for developing the prediction model due to its highly reliable performance in testing. The developed ANN models were further interpreted utilizing Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to determine the interrelationship of different parameters. Then, the probabilistic axial bucking strength prediction model was established based on the developed ANN models, where the Latin hypercube sampling method was applied to address the discreteness of geometries, material, and initial imperfections. The generated probabilistic axial bucking strength prediction model’s effectiveness was verified by the evidence that the machine learning prediction results can highly match the numerical results' probability density function and the result from codes while significantly reducing the computation time. Finally, the design parameters’ impact on the axial buckling strength’s discreteness was evaluated using the global sensitivity analysis (GSA) method. The result shows that the discreteness of design parameters substantially influences the distribution of the axial buckling strength of the steel CHS members and the proposed prediction model can provide an accurate probabilistic distribution prediction. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - AI and machine learning have made significant progress in the past decade, powering many applications in FinTech and beyond. But few machine learning models, especially deep learning models, are interpretable by humans, creating challenges for risk management and model improvements. Here, we propose a simple yet powerful framework to evaluate and interpret any black-box model with binary outcomes and explanatory variables, and heterogeneous relationships between the two. Our new metric, the signal success share (SSS) cross-entropy loss, measures how well the model captures the relationship along any feature or dimension, thereby providing actionable guidance on model improvements. Simulations demonstrate that our metric works for heterogeneous and nonlinear predictions, and distinguishes itself from traditional loss functions in evaluating model interpretability. We apply the methodology to an example of predicting loan defaults with real data. Our framework is more broadly applicable to a wide range of problems in financial and information technology. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Modern industrial operations are under growing pressure to maximize asset performance, reduce expensive downtime, and improve safety. Exploiting progress in sensor technology and data analytics, Predictive Maintenance (PdM) presents a forward-looking maintenance strategy, moving past conventional reactive or scheduled approaches. This review explores the innovative use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), encompassing Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), to significantly boost PdM efficiency. Drawing upon a methodical analysis of 29 peer-reviewed articles from the last decade, this review consolidates the current landscape, major trends, obstacles, and future outlook regarding the deployment of AI methods for industrial Predictive Maintenance. The analysis indicates a significant tendency towards utilizing DL techniques for sophisticated tasks such as Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation and anomaly identification. Developing fields include employing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for optimal maintenance scheduling, methods for explainability (XAI) for fostering trust, and the convergence of PdM with data-driven production planning and emerging Digital Twins. Despite substantial advancements, significant hurdles remain concerning data quality and accessibility, model interpretability, scalability, system integration, and cybersecurity. This review offers a thorough, holistic overview for researchers and industry professionals, underscoring the game-changing possibilities of AI within PdM and pinpointing key domains that warrant deeper exploration. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study presents early results of a web-based digital twin (DT) for battery management systems (BMS). The proposed DT explores a hybrid of model-based and data-driven approaches, enabling the exploitation of each approach’s distinctive merits and constraints. Experiments employing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques were undertaken to select the most trustworthy and explainable approach to be deployed to a web server. First, a model-based DT was developed using physics based modelling and AI to achieve the hybrid model. Next, four models, including a deep neural network, a long-short-term memory network, a graph neural network (GNN), and a transformer neural network (TNN) model, were independently trained to minimize the residual between the actual battery data and the prediction of the model-based DT. All hybrid DT models were assessed based on mean squared error, latency, and prediction confidence. With the best confidence score of 98.255% and lowest latency of 0.079, the hybrid GNN DT model emerged as the best, demonstrating the viability of the proposed explainable hybrid approach in approximating actual battery behavior and the utility of a web-based DT. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study analyzed 61,593 cases of real transaction price of apartments in Seoul from January 1, 2021 to September 30, 2023, with the output variable being set as the sales price per dedicated area and the input variables being set as the contract month, floor, year of construction, number of units, and distance to the subway station, etc. After determining which of the machine learning (ML) models, LGBM, XGBoost, and GBDT, had the best predictive power, the importance of each variable was analyzed using XAI's SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) technique. The R2 value of XGBoost was 0.917, MAE value was 134.971, and RMSE value was 191.325, showing the best predictive power. According to the results of applying the SHAP technique to the XGBoost model, heating method, year of construction, distance to subway station, contract month, number of households, distance to market, distance to middle school, distance to high school, distance to elementary school, number of floors, home network, contract date, and management method have the highest influence and importance on the sales price per dedicated area. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Rolling element bearings are critical components of rotating machinery, with their performance directly influencing the efficiency and reliability of industrial systems. At the same time, bearing faults are a leading cause of machinery failures, often resulting in costly downtime, reduced productivity, and, in extreme cases, catastrophic damage. This study presents a methodology that utilizes Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks—a recent deep learning alternative to Multilayer Perceptrons. The proposed method automatically selects the most relevant features from sensor data and searches for optimal hyper-parameters within a single unified approach. By using shallow network architectures and fewer features, the resulting models are lightweight, easily interpretable, and practical for real-time applications. Validated on two widely recognized datasets for bearing fault diagnosis, the framework achieved perfect F1-Scores for fault detection and high performance in fault and severity classification tasks, including 100% F1-Scores in most cases. Notably, it demonstrated adaptability by handling diverse fault types, such as imbalance and misalignment, within the same dataset. The availability of symbolic representations provided model interpretability, while feature attribution offered insights into the optimal feature types or signals for each studied task. These results highlight the framework’s potential for practical applications, such as real-time machinery monitoring, and for scientific research requiring efficient and explainable models. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, including deep learning and rule-based approaches, often function as black boxes, limiting transparency and increasing uncertainty in decisions. This study addresses spurious correlations, defined as associations between patterns and classes that do not reflect causal relationships, affecting AI models’ reliability and applicability. In Natural Language Processing (NLP), these correlations lead to inaccurate predictions, biases, and challenges in model generalization. We propose a method that employs Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to detect spurious patterns in textual datasets for binary classification tasks. The method applies the K-means algorithm to cluster patterns and interprets them based on their distance from centroids. It hypothesizes that patterns farther from the centroids are more likely to be spurious than those closer to them. We apply the method to public procurement datasets from the Court of Auditors of Piauí (TCE-PI) using models based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression with text representations from TFIDF and Word Embeddings, as well as a BERT model. The analysis is extended to the IMDB movie review dataset to evaluate generalizability. The results support the hypothesis that patterns farther from centroids exhibit higher spuriousness potential and demonstrate the clustering’s consistency across models and datasets. The method operates independently of the techniques used in its stages, enabling the automatic detection and quantification of spurious patterns without prior human intervention. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, we developed an interpretable machine learning (ML) framework to predict marine pollution and economic losses from accident risk factors. A triple-feature selection process identified key predictors, followed by a comparative analysis of eight ML models. Random forest outperformed other models in forecasting environmental and property damage. The interpretable model was established based on the SHAP value framework, which revealed that onboard personnel count, vessel dimensions (length), and accident/ship types account for the risk factors with the most severe consequences, with environmental conditions like wind speed and air temperature contributing secondary effects. The methodology enables two critical applications: (1) environmental agencies can proactively assess accident impact through the identified risk triggers, optimizing emergency response planning, and (2) insurance providers gain data-driven risk evaluation metrics to refine premium calculations. By quantifying how human/technical factors, including crew members and vessel specifications, dominate over natural variables in accident effects, this data-driven approach provides actionable insights for maritime safety management and financial risk mitigation, achieving high prediction accuracy while maintaining model transparency through Shapley value explanations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The operational efficiency of many industrial processes is greatly affected by condition monitoring, which has become more and more important in the detection and forecast of electrical machine failures. Early identification of possible problems and prompt and precise diagnosis reduce unscheduled downtime, lower maintenance costs, and prevent catastrophic failures. Traditional human-dependent diagnostic techniques are changing as a result of advances in artificial intelligence (AI), opening the door to automated and predictive maintenance plans. This paper provides a detailed examination of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in the prediction of electrical device failures, with a focus on techniques such as fuzzy systems, expert systems, artificial neural networks (ANNs), and complex machine-learning algorithms. These methods use both historical and present data to identify and predict problems and allow timely actions. The study looks at implementation challenges for AI-based diagnostic systems, including data dependencies, processing demands, and model interpretability, in addition to highlighting recent advances such as digital twins, explainable AI, and IoT integration. This review highlights the revolutionary potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in improving the sustainability, efficiency, and dependability of electrical machine systems, especially in the context of rotating machines, by addressing existing constraints and suggesting future research routes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Pocket parks are regarded as valuable tools for providing green activity spaces for citizens in high-density mountainous cities. However, existing research on the pocket park vitality has hardly paid attention to mountainous cities. Due to the unique topographical conditions of mountainous cities, the built environment factors influencing the pocket parks vitality may be more complex, new indicators such as sky view factors, average slope and building enclosure have been taken into account. This study takes Chongqing as a case study of a mountainous city. It utilizes location-based service data to measure pocket park vitality. An interpretable machine learning model that integrates eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is employed to explore the nonlinear effects and interactions of built environment factors on pocket park vitality. Results indicate that: (1) Sky view factors and residential population are significant factors affecting pocket park vitality in mountainous cities. (2) Different built environment elements in mountainous cities have optimal threshold effects on pocket park vitality. For example, optimal park areas of less than 0.08 ha, vegetation coverage rates below 0.57 are built environment intervals that can significantly enhance pocket park vitality. (3) The spatial distribution map of SHAP values and the interaction analysis reveal the spatial effects and interrelationships of built environment factors. For example, the interaction between Residential Population and Floor Area Ratio exemplifies the complex mechanism of the synergistic impact of multiple factors. We further explain specific pocket parks in combination with local contributions and put forward precise optimization strategies based on the park attributes and characteristics of the surrounding environment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The extensive utilization of natural aggregates in the construction industry can be reduced by replacing them with natural and locally available materials like coral sand aggregate. However, accurately determining the compressive strength (CS) of coral sand aggregate concrete (CSAC) is challenging due to its complex and non-linear behavior. Consequently, traditional techniques are ineffective. Also, there are very few reliable prediction models available in the literature for determining CS of CSAC. Thus, this study aimed to use machine learning (ML) algorithms like Multi Expression Programming (MEP), AdaBoost, and Bagging Regressor (BR) using dataset already available in the literature for predicting CS of CSAC. The dataset collected featured crucial input parameters like immersion period, confining pressure, size of coral aggregate etc. and a single output i.e., CS. The predictive models were validated by using residual assessment, k-fold cross validation, and external validation checks etc. which revealed that BR exhibited the highest accuracy having testing R2 value of 0.996. However, MEP provided an empirical equation as an output while BR failed to do so. In addition, explanatory techniques like shapely additive analysis (SHAP) and individual conditional expectation (ICE) analysis were used on the BR model to investigate the significance of input features as well as their relationship with the predicted outcome. Finally, a graphical user interface has been developed to help effectively implement the predictive models developed in this study in the industry. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Customer segmentation plays a critical role in enhancing a company's product penetration rate in the market. It enables numerous downstream applications such as customer-oriented product development and trend analysis. Previous approaches to customer segmentation have relied either on survey-based methods or data-driven approaches. However, these methods face challenges such as high human labor requirements or the generation of noisy segments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a new methodology based on data-driven network construction and an importance-enhanced framework. The framework incorporates two techniques: (1) the utilization of a neural network model to compute feature importance values and (2) the proposal of a novel network connection rule. This framework addresses the limitation of the previous approach, sentiment-polarity-based networking, by connecting customers based on feature importance. We further validated the effectiveness of the framework using three real-world datasets and demonstrated that the proposed method outperformed the previous approach. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Concrete is a common building material due to its excellent properties. The engineering performance of concrete depends significantly on its compositions. Characterizing concrete performance and determining its reasonable composition is challenging. This study developed a novel framework to characterize concrete performance and determine the optimal composition based on the simplicial homology global optimization (SHGO) and the eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm. The XGBoost algorithm captured the complex interrelations between the compositions and the corresponding performance. The SHGO was leveraged to determine the reasonable and optimal composition for improving the performance. The light aggregate concrete illustrated the developed framework. Meanwhile, the framework's performance was investigated and validated using laboratory tests. The relative error between the 28-day and 90-day compressive strength and the test value is less than 4 %, and the relative error of the mass is less than 2 %. Compared with the traditional design method, the 90-day compressive strength increased by 2.6 %, and the mass reduced by 5.5 %. Thus, the XGBoost adequately characterizes the performance of the lightweight, and the determined composition is different from the composition determined by the orthogonal experiments. However, the performance of the concrete improved significantly. It proved that the developed framework outperformed the traditional method. It also has essential guiding significance for the performance characterization and composition design of other civil engineering materials. The developed framework provides an excellent, scientific, and promising civil material characterizing and design tool. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Glass powder concrete (GPC) holds the potential to reduce the damaging impact of construction industry on the natural environment by cutting down the amounts of cement and natural aggregates used in concrete. However, it requires having reliable ways for predicting key properties of GPC such as compressive strength (CS). The laboratory determination of GPC strength comes with various resource and time limitations due to which this study focused on using advanced machine learning (ML) techniques for predicting CS. Four algorithms including Multi Expression Programming (MEP), AdaBoost, HistGBR, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) were used for this purpose on a database retrieved from literature published internationally. The mixture composition of GPC like glass powder content, water-to-cement ratio, sand content along with concrete age etc. were used as predictors while CS was the only outcome. The algorithm's performance was validated by several techniques including k-fold cross validation, scatter plots, and residual distribution. Different error evaluation metrics were also utilized which revealed that XGB had the superior accuracy compared to its counterparts with a testing coefficient of determination (R2) value equal to 0.993. In contrast, MEP depicted its outcome as an equation which XGB and all the other algorithms could not provide. Moreover, interpretable ML techniques like shapely and Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) analysis were employed for investigation of the significance and relationships between inputs and the predicted outcome. Furthermore, a graphical user interface has been developed which will enable the professionals in the civil engineering industry to utilize the findings of this study seamlessly. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - To enhance sustainability in the construction industry, substituting primary with recycled aggregates from construction and demolition waste (CDW) is essential. However, the necessary quality assessment of recycled aggregates, especially their particle size distribution (PSD), through sampling and manual sieving is time-consuming and prone to sampling errors due to the heterogeneity of CDW waste and fluctuating material flows combined with small sampling and manual sieving volumes. Here, we introduce a novel inline monitoring approach using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to estimate PSDs from inline 3D laser triangulation (3DLT) sensor data of both primary and recycled aggregate particles. Analyzing 174,220 particles across nine size classes with a dual camera 3DLT sensor, a customized VGG-inspired CNN model outperformed other architectures, achieving accuracies of 80.8 % and 75.0 % for primary and recycled aggregates at particle level, respectively. Most errors were near-miss classifications, yielding a mean absolute error of 1.0 vol% in PSD predictions at material flow level. Explainable artificial intelligence techniques confirmed the reliance of CNNs on particle contours for robust classification. Our findings offer a pathway for inline PSD monitoring in processing of both primary and recycled aggregates, contributing to a more quality-orientated, circular, and sustainable construction industry. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In the pursuit of sustainable urban development, construction land development (CLD) not only carries the important mission of promoting economic growth but also needs to actively respond to the environmental requirements of reducing carbon emissions. However, there is a tension and balance between these two objectives. This study explores the evolution characteristics and influencing mechanisms of the synergistic relationship between carbon emission efficiency and economic benefits of CLD based on the undesirable slacks-based measurement, coupling coordination degree (CCD) model, Tapio decoupling model, spatial convergence model, and interpretable machine learning techniques. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) The CCR between CEE and economic benefits of CLD in China shows the characteristic of “improvement-stability-local decline”, and it is higher in the eastern region than in the central and western regions. (2) The decoupling of carbon emission efficiency (CEE) and economic benefits of CLD between 2003 and 2023 shows diverse trends in different provinces and time scales in China. (3) China’s eastern region are consistent with σ-convergence and β-convergence, and the gap in the level of inter-regional coupling co-ordination has narrowed. On the contrary, the central and western regions do not pass the σ and β-convergence tests, and the regional equilibrium needs to be improved. (4) In descending order of influence on CCR, they are ownership structure, urban construction land per capita, energy consumption per unit of gross domestic product, energy structure, industrial structure, and foreign trade investment intensity. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Valorizing industrial byproducts in construction applications is a promising approach for enhancing sustainability. Global annual production of ceramic waste including broken tiles is a considerable challenge. Yet, such ceramic tile waste has great potential in sustainable concrete production, for instance as fine and coarse aggregate. Effective use of ceramic tile waste in concrete requires accurate prediction of recycled tile concrete mechanical strength. This study deploys state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for predicting the compressive and tensile strength of ceramic tile-based concrete. The authors recently performed an extensive experimental program on the mechanical characterization of ceramic tile-based concrete, allowing to build a comprehensive database of 252 data points with varying key mixture proportions. The latter was used to develop a data-driven machine learning (ML) modeling framework for predicting the mechanical properties of the concrete using XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, and Extra Trees regressors. The independent variables of the dataset affecting mechanical strength included the cast density, percentage of ceramic tiles used as coarse and fine aggregate, water-to-cement ratio, water absorption capacity, and hydration age. The influence of different input features on the model predictions was visualized using SHAP feature importance plots. Ultimately, a machine learning-based and user-friendly graphical interface was created and made available through the Streamlit platform to aid in the design of ceramic tile-based sustainable concrete. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study leverages machine learning to enhance the prediction of high-strength concrete (HSC) compressive strength, addressing the limitations of conventional methods, which are often tedious, less reliable, and time-consuming. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) serves as the primary model, with hyperparameter optimization via metaheuristic algorithms such as Cuckoo Search (CSA), Water Strider (WS), Leopard Seal (LS), Harris Hawk (HH), Invasive Weed (IW), and Forest Optimization (FO). A total of 681 data sets were collected from existing literature. The models underwent tenfold cross-validation, with the LS-XGB model achieving an almost ideal performance in testing sets. Other models, including CSA-XGB, WS-XGB, HH-XGB, IW-XGB, and FO-XGB, also demonstrated strong performance, each with R2 > 0.96. For model explainability, Shapley's Additive Explanation (SHAP) analysis has been applied to the best-performing LS-XGB model. The analysis revealed that cement and superplasticizer (SP) are the most crucial features contributing to HSC development, with optimal ranges identified at 600–900 kg/m3 for cement and 8–10 kg/m3 for SP. The study demonstrates on how feature interactions contribute to concrete materials compressive strength, providing better and above all sustainable constructions. Furthermore, the LS-XGB model's optimal performance depicts the strongly nonlinear nature of HSC materials, validated through a set of derived graphs. Additionally, 30 concrete cubes were prepared for experimental validation, and the datasets demonstrated an accuracy of 92% showcasing the ability of models to make well informed decision. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study presents a comprehensive decision-making framework that employs eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)-based methods to improve proactive road transport safety management, which is critical for global supply chain networks. The framework offers explainable predictions as well as suggestions pertaining to the near-future digitization of safety tools and their usage, customized for road transport safety management. We employed four black-box machine learning-based models—artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)—in this setting to enhance our comprehension of the crash-related risk factors that contribute to the severity of traffic accident injuries. Due to their opaqueness and complex inner workings, stakeholders often perceive these models as data-driven black-box approaches, making them incapable of providing an efficient decision-support tool. The recommended decision support incorporates agreement levels for predictions and interpretation across various XAI modeling paradigms. We deploy PFI (Permutation Feature Importance) and FIRM (Feature Importance Ranking Measures) tools to evaluate the extent of agreement in explainability between these various modeling approaches. The recommendations are based on PFI and FIRM values of highly performing models. We execute the framework as an illustration of the concept using a real crash dataset obtained from the NHTSA (National Highway Transportation Safety Administration of the United States) and report end-user feedback for use by transport policymakers. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Explanations are conceived to ensure the trustworthiness of AI systems. Yet, relying solemnly on algorithmic solutions, as provided by explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), might fall short to account for sociotechnical risks jeopardizing their factuality and informativeness. To mitigate these risks, we delve into the complex landscape of ethical risks surrounding XAI systems and their generated explanations. By employing a literature review combined with rigorous thematic analysis, we uncover a diverse array of technical risks tied to the robustness, fairness, and evaluation of XAI systems. Furthermore, we address a broader range of contextual risks jeopardizing their security, accountability, reception alongside other cognitive, social, and ethical concerns of explanations. We advance a multi-layered risk assessment framework, where each layer advances strategies for practical intervention, management, and documentation of XAI systems within organizations. Recognizing the theoretical nature of the framework advanced, we discuss it in a conceptual case study. For the XAI community, our multifaceted investigation represents a path to practically address XAI risks while enriching our understanding of the ethical ramifications of incorporating XAI in decision-making processes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Ensuring safe drinking water necessitates advanced management and monitoring techniques for water quality in distribution systems. This study leverages machine learning (ML) to model chlorine decay in a water distribution system (WDS) in British Columbia, Canada. A four-layer long short term memory (LSTM) network was trained to predict chlorine concentrations at a reservoir >24,000 m from the treatment plant. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques were applied to the trained network to address critical issues, such as enhancing the transparency and reliability of ML models. Several XAI methods were used to investigate the importance of sensor placement, identify the most significant features, understand feature ranges that result in poor performance, and validate model logic. Results demonstrated that for ML-based WDS control, sensor location is not critical, with high prediction accuracy achieved (mean absolute error <0.025 mg/L) even when exclusively using data from nodes spatially distant from the prediction site. XAI techniques showed the capability of identifying essential features and demonstrated that the behaviour of the ML model conformed with the expectations of chlorine behaviour. Superfluous variables were ranked low in importance, and the model learned fundamental aspects of chemical kinetics, such as temperature dependence and decay rate. Most importantly, the XAI methods applied showed the capability to communicate the reasoning for specific predictions, even at a local or sample-specific level. This study underscores the importance of transparency and trust in ML models, especially as the field transitions towards digital twin and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, to enhance the effective management of water quality systems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Linear construction projects, such as pipeline irrigation projects, are prone to delays and cost overruns owing to inaccurate cost and duration estimates. The research gap pertains to studies that concentrated exclusively on predicting costs or durations using backbox artificial intelligence models. Consequently, this study introduces an innovative approach that utilizes explainable artificial intelligence to forecast the conceptual cost and duration of irrigation projects simultaneously. This study analyzed data from 1,277 historical cases using factor analysis and stepwise regression to distill 25 parameters down to five key drivers. It evaluates 12 machine learning models, including multiple linear regression, artificial neural networks, and decision tree-based ensemble methods. Bayesian optimization was employed to fine-tune the performance of each algorithm. The light gradient boosting machine is identified as the most effective algorithm for cost prediction, with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 2.989 % and an Adjusted Determination Coefficient (R⁎2) of 0.931. For duration prediction, the extremely randomized tree model stands out, achieving a MAPE of 2.533 % and an R⁎2 of 0.961. The study further employs the Shapley additive explanation technique to improve the interpretability of the key drivers used for predicting both the budget and the timeline. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Flood susceptibility mapping (FSM) is crucial for effective flood risk management, particularly in flood-prone regions like Pakistan. This study addresses the need for accurate and scalable FSM by systematically evaluating the performance of 14 machine learning (ML) models in high-risk areas of Pakistan. The novelty lies in the comprehensive comparison of these models and the use of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques. We employed XAI to identify significant conditioning factors for flood susceptibility at both the model training and prediction stages. The models were assessed for both accuracy and scalability, with specific focus on computational efficiency. Our findings indicate that LGBM and XGBoost are the top performers in terms of accuracy, with XGBoost also excelling in scalability, achieving a prediction time of ~18 s compared to LGBM's 22 s and random forest's 31 s. The evaluation framework presented is applicable to other flood-prone regions and highlights that LGBM is superior for accuracy-focused applications, while XGBoost is optimal for scenarios with computational constraints. The findings of this study can assist in accurate FSM in different regions and can also assist in scaling up the analysis to a larger geographical region which could assist in better decision-making and informed policy production for flood risk management. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - As the levels of automation and reliance on modern artificial intelligence (AI) approaches increase across multiple industries, the importance of the human-centered perspective becomes more evident. Various actors in such industrial applications, including equipment operators and decision makers, have their needs and preferences that often do not align with the decisions produced by black-box models, potentially leading to mistrust and wasted productivity gain opportunities. In this paper, we examine these issues through the lenses of visual analytics and, more broadly, interactive visualization, and we argue that the methods and techniques from these fields can lead to advances in both academic research and industrial innovations concerning the explainability of AI models. To address the existing gap within and across the research and application fields, we propose a conceptual framework for visual analytics design and evaluation for such scenarios, followed by a preliminary roadmap and call to action for the respective communities. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Featured Application: Potential applications of the work include more reliable dedicated AI-based predictive maintenance systems based on digital twins and generative AI. Generative AI (GenAI) is revolutionizing digital twins (DTs) for fault diagnosis and predictive maintenance in Industry 4.0 and 5.0 by enabling real-time simulation, data augmentation, and improved anomaly detection. DTs, virtual replicas of physical systems, already use generative models to simulate various failure scenarios and rare events, improving system resilience and failure prediction accuracy. They create synthetic datasets that improve training quality while addressing data scarcity and data imbalance. The aim of this paper was to present the current state of the art and perspectives for using AI-based generative DTs for fault diagnosis for predictive maintenance in Industry 4.0/5.0. With GenAI, DTs enable proactive maintenance and minimize downtime, and their latest implementations combine multimodal sensor data to generate more realistic and actionable insights into system performance. This provides realistic operational profiles, identifying potential failure scenarios that traditional methods may miss. New perspectives in this area include the incorporation of Explainable AI (XAI) to increase transparency in decision-making and improve reliability in key industries such as manufacturing, energy, and healthcare. As Industry 5.0 emphasizes a human-centric approach, AI-based generative DT can seamlessly integrate with human operators to support collaboration and decision-making. The implementation of edge computing increases the scalability and real-time capabilities of DTs in smart factories and industrial Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Future advances may include federated learning to ensure data privacy while enabling data exchange between enterprises for fault diagnostics, and the evolution of GenAI alongside industrial systems, ensuring their long-term validity. However, challenges remain in managing computational complexity, ensuring data security, and addressing ethical issues during implementation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The double facade solar chimney along with energy storage components is a sustainable building technology that harnesses the power of the sun to regulate indoor temperatures. Extensive research has been conducted on the theoretical simulation of such systems. The novelty of this work is to explore the potential of explainable artificial intelligence in improving the design and optimization of the double-skin solar chimney. The need for this research is owing to the high computational limitations of the physical model of such systems, thus the application of explainable artificial intelligence based upon artificial neural network can address this research gap. The paper solved a validated physical model and demonstrates the suitability of artificial neural network twins as computational-efficient subrogates that can be later used by a multiobjective optimization function to find the optimal design values for the facades of double-skin buildings. The results of the comparison between the physical and the artificial neural network model show the practical advantage of utilizing the digital twin model without compromising accuracy. The results have indicated that the artificial neural network can achieve a high coefficient of determination ranging from 0.921 to 0.999 on different performance indicators that implies a high goodness of fit. Accordingly, the optimization study based upon a nonsorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) has indicated a high ventilation rate of 2.86 1/h and an efficiency of 37.21%. The insights of this work have reflected that exploring the societal implications of sustainable building technologies such as the double facade solar chimney through educational initiatives can cultivate a new generation of society who not only understand the technical aspects but also appreciate the broader social and environmental contexts of their work, eventually to have future buildings with integrated passive systems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Urban comfort is a means of measuring the dynamic quality of urban life as an outcome of the interaction between humans and urban environments, capturing spatio-temporal phenomena in cities. We design a multidimensional urban comfort framework encompassing 44 features, to comprehensively represent urban living environments, based on 3D urban morphology, socio-economic features, human perception, and environmental factors. We develop a graph-based approach to measure urban comfort through an index and explain its driving forces by exploiting spatial relationships between urban comfort and surrounding features. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is leveraged to interpret feature importance and inherent complexity in urban contexts, advancing conventional methods that are limited to linear relationships. We implement the framework in Amsterdam, generating a city-wide comfort index. Compared to the baseline random forest model, our graph-based approach demonstrates competitive performance in measuring the urban comfort index, achieving an MAE of 1.03, an RMSE of 2.04, and an R-squared value of 93.6%. Meanwhile, we visualise how the urban comfort index changes across quarters, examining the spatio-temporal dynamics at the neighbourhood level. Furthermore, we employ XAI to explain the positive and negative impacts of urban features by categorising neighbourhoods into high and low-comfort groups, indicating the varied contributions of urban features. Exploring the usability of the urban comfort index, we simulate various urban strategies in a neighbourhood of interest benefiting from urban digital twins (e.g. improving air quality to mitigate its negative impact on urban comfort). The urban comfort study demonstrates the potential to address information gaps by incorporating multidimensional features in cities, thereby providing insights into understanding and interpreting local comfort. It can further serve as an instrument to inform neighbourhood design, suggest feasible strategies, and indicate far-reaching implications for urban health and wellbeing. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The intelligent design of shear wall structures is a critical aspect of smart construction, with a high demand for research and applications. Accurately predicting the shear wall ratio (i.e., the shear wall area-to-floor area ratio) during cost estimation and rapidly generating shear wall layouts during early design is essential. However, the unclear influences of numerous design feature parameters hinder the enhancement of generative AI design. This affects both the prediction of shear wall ratios from multidimensional features and the generation of shear wall layouts from high-dimensional features. Therefore, a method for generating key structural design features using machine learning (ML) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), along with model interpretation, is proposed in this study. Existing shear wall design data are collected, and features such as the architectural plan geometry, seismic design conditions, and shear wall ratios are extracted to establish a dataset. Key shear wall ratio parameters are predicted using an ML model with multidimensional design features as inputs, and interpretability analysis is conducted using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). Concurrently, a GAN model is built to generate shear wall designs using fused image-text high-dimensional features, and the influence patterns of design features are explained through sensitivity analysis. The analysis results indicate that the prediction accuracy is effectively enhanced by ML-based multidimensional feature learning, shear wall designs are effectively generated by GAN-based high-dimensional feature learning, and seismic design intensity and structural height are revealed as significant factors through interpretability analysis. Furthermore, when high-dimensional feature inputs are available, the generation of comprehensive features should be prioritized for shear wall structural designs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study investigates the association between aggressive driving behavior and elderly pedestrian traffic accidents using the Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) method. This study focuses on Seoul, South Korea, where an aging population and urban challenges create a pressing need for pedestrian safety research. The analysis reveals that aggressive driving behaviors, particularly rapid acceleration, rapid deceleration, and speeding, are the most influential factors on the frequency of and deaths from elderly pedestrian traffic accidents. In addition, several built environments and demographic factors such as the number of crosswalks and elderly population play varying roles depending on the spatial match or mismatch between risky driving areas and accident spots. The findings of this study underscore the importance of tailored interventions including well-lit crosswalks, traffic calming measures, and driver education, to reduce the vulnerabilities of elderly pedestrians. The integration of XAI methods provides transparency and interpretability, enabling policymakers to make data-driven decisions. Expanding this approach to other urban contexts with diverse characteristics could validate and refine the findings, contributing to a comprehensive strategy for improving pedestrian safety globally. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study introduces an innovative machine learning method to model the spatial variation of land surface temperature (LST) with a focus on the urban center of Da Nang, Vietnam. Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), support vector machine, random forest, and Deep Neural Network are employed to establish functional relationships between urban LST and its influencing factors. The machine learning approaches are trained and validated using remote sensing data from 2014, 2019, and 2024. Various explanatory variables representing topographical and spatial characteristics, as well as urban landscapes, are used. Experimental results show that LightGBM outperforms other benchmark methods. In addition, Shapley Additive Explanations are utilized to clarify the impact of the factors affecting LST. The analysis outcomes indicate that while the importance of these variables changes over time, urban density and greenspace density consistently emerge as the most influential factors. LightGBM attained R2 values of 0.85, 0.92, and 0.91 for the years 2014, 2019, and 2024, respectively. The findings of this work can be helpful for deeper understanding of urban heat stress dynamics and facilitate urban planning. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Innovative agricultural solutions are needed to detect and classify leaf diseases early across crop species and environments. This study compares deep learning approaches, focusing on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformers (VTs), to identify leaf diseases early and accurately for scalable crop management and productivity. Optimizing CNNs, Explainable Transfer Learning (ETPLDNet) using ResNet50 architecture, and LEViT leaf disease diagnosis are compared. The CNN model, optimized with dynamic hyperparameters, achieved an impressive 99.58% accuracy for leaf disease classification, demonstrating its effectiveness in feature extraction and classification precision. On the other hand, the VT-based LEViT model, which leverages self-attention mechanisms and Explainable AI (XAI), achieved 95.22% accuracy but offers enhanced interpretability and generalization capabilities due to its transformer-based architecture. This distinction illustrates that while CNNs excel in accuracy, VTs provide a more transparent decision-making process and better handle the complex variances in plant leaf diseases, making them ideal for precision agriculture. The combined use of CNNs and VTs showcases the strengths of each model, with CNN focusing on high classification precision and VTs offering improved interpretability and adaptability for various leaf disease conditions. The use of XAI enables the models to highlight important areas in plant leaf images that influence the model's decisions, offering a transparent and interpretable decision-making process that allows researchers and farmers to understand why a particular diagnosis or classification was made. This ability to visualize and explain the reasoning behind the model predictions is crucial to increasing trust in AI-driven solutions in agriculture. By combining the high precision of CNN and the interpretability of VT with XAI, this study offers a robust approach to improving crop disease management and precision agriculture. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The construction and operation of large-scale hydraulic projects improve water resource utilization efficiency, but negatively impact ecology and environment, especially exacerbating the eutrophication risk in the fluctuating backwater zones (FBZs). However, Due to its dual characteristics of both rivers and reservoirs, eutrophication patterns in FBZs have not been explored comprehensively. This study focuses on the FBZ formed by the Three Gorges Dam (TGD), the world's largest hydropower plant. By integrating the multi-source monitoring data with Normalized Difference Chlorophyll Index (NDCI) inversed by remote sensing data, interpretable machine learning methods (XGBoost and SHAP) were applied to quantify the contributions of key eutrophication drivers. The results showed that as the water storage level rose to 175 m (2010–2016), the total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations in the FBZ increased by 10.4 % and 5.9 % respectively, compared to the natural river period (2004–2005). While TP concentrations have decreased in recent years (2021–2023), the pollution risk from TN has not been mitigated. Eutrophication drivers exhibit notable variability across different temporal scales, with pollutant emissions resulting from intense human activities being the primary drivers of elevated TN and TP concentrations on an annual scale. Seasonal variations in rainfall and temperature result in temporal heterogeneity in nutrient concentrations on a monthly scale. SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) analysis reveals that the TGR's water storage volume and runoff load in the FBZ account for 45.9 % of the total influence on algal blooms. This result highlights that reduced flow velocity, driven by upstream and downstream dam impoundments, is the dominant factor behind algal bloom outbreaks in the FBZ. This study analyses the complex influences that trigger algal blooms in the FBZ which differ from rivers and lakes， and that could provide important references for managing eutrophication in global FBZs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The production of cement is crucial for sustainable building construction but is costly and contributes significantly to environmental pollution. To address these issues, this research investigates the potential of partially replacing cement with waste banana leaf ash (BLA), a pozzolanic material, in concrete mixtures. The aim of this study is to evaluate the fresh, mechanical, durability, and microstructural properties of BLA-incorporated concrete, alongside its environmental and economic impacts. Experimental methods assessed the workability (slump and compaction factor), mechanical properties (compressive, split-tensile strength, and modulus of elasticity), and durability aspects through Rapid Chloride Penetration Test (RCPT), Water Permeability Test (WPT), sorptivity, and electrical resistivity tests. Results indicate that as BLA content increases, workability declines. Mechanically, BLA concrete generally shows reduced performance; however, the 10% BLA mix improves strength compared to other BLA percentages. Durability tests reveal significant improvements from 28 to 91 days for the 10% BLA mix, with RCPT, WPT, sorptivity, and resistivity increasing by 22.44%, 19.55%, 49.02%, and 18.72%, respectively. Microstructural analysis via Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) indicates a decrease in ettringite formation with BLA. Additionally, machine learning models were applied to predict compressive strength, identifying influential factors using SHapley additive explanations (SHAP) and Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) analyses. The 10% BLA concrete mix achieved a 14.78% reduction in Global Warming Potential (GWP) compared to conventional concrete, with a GWP of 426.29 kgCO2-eq/kg, and proved cost-effective. These findings suggest that a 10% cement replacement with BLA presents an optimal balance of environmental sustainability, cost-effectiveness, and strength for construction housing sector. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Ridesharing is a crucial component in optimizing urban mobility by alleviating traffic congestion and reducing emissions. However, the ridesharing potential remains underutilized, and the distribution characteristics of this potential have yet to be well quantified. This study leverages the shareability network method and interpretable machine learning techniques, utilizing high-precision taxi trajectory data, to analyze the spatiotemporal patterns of ridesharing potential in Shanghai and to elucidate the spatiotemporal dynamics of the factors influencing it. The findings reveal that ridesharing potential is highest during evening peaks, followed by weekends, and lowest during morning peaks, which contrasts with typical residential travel patterns. The results highlight the nonlinear, spatiotemporal heterogeneity of built environment impacts on ridesharing potential, with significant variations in the importance of residential, employment, and leisure factors across different time periods. These insights provide valuable guidance for urban planners and transportation network companies in enhancing operational efficiency and effectively promoting ridesharing. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A hybrid intelligent framework is proposed in this paper to reduce the existing tunnel deformation caused by shield adjacent undercrossing construction (SAUC). A Bayesian optimization natural gradient boosting (BO-NGBoost) model for existing tunnel deformation prediction is developed, and the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) approach is used to analyze the interpretability of the prediction model. The multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) is used to optimize the construction parameters. The applicability and validity of the proposed method are tested in a case study from the Wuhan Metro. The results indicate that (1) the established BO-NGBoost existing tunnel deformation prediction model shows high accuracy. (2) Through SHAP analysis, the importance of each input parameter to the existing tunnel deformation is identified, and the key shield optimization parameters are defined. (3) By using the developed BO-NGBoost-MOEA/D algorithm to optimize the key parameters, the existing tunnel deformation is effectively controlled. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The assessment and classification of architectural sectional drawings is critical in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) field, where the accurate representation of complex structures and the extraction of meaningful patterns are key challenges. This paper established a framework for standardizing different forms of architectural drawings into a consistent graph format, and evaluated different Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) architectures, pooling methods, node features, and masking techniques. This paper demonstrates that GNNs can be practically applied in the design and review process, particularly for categorizing details and detecting errors in architectural drawings. The potential for visual explanations of model decisions using Explainable AI (XAI) is also explored to enhance the reliability and user understanding of AI models in architecture. This paper highlights the potential of GNNs in architectural data analysis and outlines the challenges and future directions for broader application in the AEC field. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Neurologists often face challenges in identifying epileptic activities within multichannel EEG recordings, requiring extensive hours of analysis. Computer-aided diagnosis systems have been proposed to reduce manual inspection of EEG signals by neurologists. However, direct analysis of EEG signals is difficult due to their complex and dynamic nature, with variation across multiple patients. Therefore, researchers have proposed the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to capture dynamic events indicative of seizures through time-varying frequency representation of EEG signals. However, tradeoffs between time and frequency resolution limited the spectrogram's interpretability and affected clinical deployment. Hence, this study proposes extracting high-resolution channels via a novel STFT spectrogram construction algorithm encompassing taper functions for seizure diagnosis. Initially, we extracted seizure and non-seizure segments from each channel of selected patients in the CHB-MIT dataset. Next, we systematically apply taper functions like Hann and Gaussian windows to minimize the edge effect during the construction of spectrogram images. Finally, we employ Dilated Convolutional Squeeze and Excitation Networks (DCSENets) through leave-one-patient-out cross-validation (LOPOCV) to perform patient-independent seizure classification. The proposed DCSENets achieve an average accuracy of 87.20±11.48% and 87.29±10.48% with Hann and Gaussian taper functions, respectively, and 86.85±11.56% without the taper function. Most patients with high performances indicate similarity in train-test sample distribution using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test at 0.01<p≤0.05 or p>0.05. Furthermore, the Grad CAM deep visual explainer integration enhances the interpretability of the deep learning model's decision-making process. Consequently, neurologists are provided not only with enhanced visualized spectrograms but also a transparent model for improved seizure diagnosis. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Text augmentation, a method for generating samples by applying combinations, noise, and other manipulations to a small dataset, is a crucial technique in natural language processing research. It introduced diversity into the training process, thereby enabling the construction of robust models. The level of manipulation is the most important issue in text augmentation; low-level manipulation generates data similar to the original, resulting in inefficient augmentation because it cannot ensure diversity, whereas high-level manipulation causes reliability issues for labels and degrades the model’s performance. Therefore, this paper proposes a systematically adjustable text augmentation technique to address the “level of manipulation” issue. Specifically, it proposes a method for systematically adjusting the data candidate pool for manipulation to provide an appropriate level of randomness during the augmentation process. Furthermore, we propose an advanced sentence embedding methodology to achieve robust pseudo-labeling at the manipulation level. In other words, we leverage combined sentence embedding, which incorporates sentence embedding, document embedding, and XAI information from the original data to assign reliable pseudo-labels. We conducted performance comparisons with existing text augmentation approaches to validate the effectiveness of our proposed methodology. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the highest performance improvement across all the experimental datasets. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The increasing complexity and interconnectivity of industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPSs), while enhancing operational security and reliability, have also introduced significant cybersecurity challenges. Software-defined networking (SDN), a transformative technology for centralized and dynamic resource management, is particularly vulnerable as centralized control planes can become single points of failure. The integration of Digital Twin technology, which creates virtual replicas of physical systems for real-time monitoring and prediction, further exacerbates security risks. To address these issues, we present TwinSec-IDS, an advanced intrusion detection framework designed for SDN-Digital-Twin-based ICPS. TwinSec-IDS provides comprehensive and proactive intrusion detection, thereby enhancing the resilience of industrial networks. This paper introduces an ensemble approach, leveraging hybrid deep learning models—such as Bi-GRU-CNN, Bi-GRU-LSTM, and Bi-GRU-LSTM-CNN—integrated with ensemble-based feature selection techniques. The system employs weighted majority voting to combine predictions from multiple models, improving detection accuracy. To ensure optimal feature selection, the framework incorporates explainable AI and multiple filter methods, including mutual information, chi-square tests, and correlation coefficients, aggregated through a voting mechanism. TwinSec-IDS demonstrates high accuracy in detecting and categorizing anomalies and effectively responds to potential threats. Extensive evaluations show that TwinSec-IDS significantly improves the security and resilience of SDN-Digital-Twin-based ICPS, addressing critical cybersecurity concerns and making industrial processes safer and more reliable. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Roadway crash data are very rare and occur randomly, therefore there are several challenges to developing a crash prediction model for real-time traffic safety management. Recently, to resolve the problem of crash data sample size, researchers have conducted studies on crash data augmentation using machine learning techniques for developing safety evaluation models. However, it's important to incorporate the specific characteristics of crash data into augmentation and crash risk assessment, as these characteristics vary depending on spatial and temporal conditions. Method: Therefore, this study developed a real-time crash risk model in three stages. First, crash data were clustered to define heterogeneous crash risk situations and then, key variables were derived by the ensemble and explainable artificial intelligence techniques, Boruta-SHAP. Second, augmentation of each clustered crash data was performed using oversampling techniques including Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN), which can consider each crash risk cluster's characteristics. Finally, crash risk models were developed and compared with other crash risk models developed by using binary logistic regression model (BLM), Random Forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Results: The results showed that the CGAN-based XGBoost model has the best performance and the variable of the temporal speed difference at 10-minute intervals and the precipitation variable have a large impact on crash risk prediction. This paper emphasizes that crash risk characteristics must be distinguished in crash risk prediction and provides new insights into addressing the imbalance data issue within crash and non-crash datasets. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In the rapidly evolving risk management domain, Explainable AI (XAI) has transitioned from a theoretical concept to an indispensable tool, empowering decision-makers with deeper insights to make informed decisions. However, the reliability of these decisions hinges on the trustworthiness of XAI outputs. Though traditional XAI models shed light on decision-influencing factors, they should also guarantee the accuracy of their explanations. This is particularly critical when future decisions are influenced by various uncertain factors, necessitating a trustworthy determination of factors influencing those decisions. This paper introduces the Instance-based XAI for Uncertain and Dynamic Decisions (IXAI-UDD) framework to achieve this aim. IXAI-UDD combines instance-based learning with transparent, supervised, and unsupervised algorithms to enable decision-makers to adjust the feature values in light of uncertainties. This is used to first accurately identify the decision output for a given time slot and subsequently determine the key features affecting that output. In our case scenario, the framework achieved an accuracy rate of 96% for high, low, and safe risk classifications while identifying contributing features with over 85% precision across multiple time slots. This enables effective management of uncertainties or anomalies impacting the input data before determining the output and the features leading to that output. To validate the accuracy and reliability of IXAI-UDD outputs, we employ Mosaic for precision assessment and Heatmaps for multi-class evaluation. This comprehensive methodology enhances the decision-maker's understanding of risk factors, improving risk management strategies in dynamic, uncertain environments. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Fast and accurate identification of potato plant traits is essential for formulating effective cultivation strategies. The integration of spectral cameras on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has demonstrated appealing potential, facilitating non-invasive investigations on a large scale by providing valuable features for construction of machine learning models. Nevertheless, interpreting these features, and those derived from them, remains a challenge, limiting confident utilization in real-world applications. In this study, the interpretability of machine learning models is addressed by employing SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) to better understand the modeling process. The XGBoost model was trained on a multispectral dataset of potato plants and evaluated on various tasks, i.e. variety classification, physiological measures estimation, and detection of early blight disease. To optimize its performance, nearly 100 vegetation indices and over 500 auto-generated features were utilized for training. The results indicate successful separation of plant varieties with up to 97.10% accuracy, estimation of physiological values with a maximum R2 and rNRMSE of 0.57 and 0.129, respectively, and detection of early blight with an F1 score of 0.826. Furthermore, both UMAP and SHAP proved beneficial for comprehensive analysis. UMAP visual observations closely corresponded to computed metrics, enhancing confidence for variety differentiation. Concurrently, SHAP identified the most informative features – green, red edge, and NIR channels – for most tasks, aligning tightly with existing literature. This study highlights potential improvements in farming efficiency, crop yield, and sustainability, and promotes the development of interpretable machine learning models for remote sensing applications. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Freeway crash risk prediction is a critical component of traffic safety management, yet existing crash risk models often fail to capture complex driving behaviors and lack interpretability. This study introduces a novel freeway crash risk prediction framework based on the Deep Forest (DF) algorithm, considering the detailed risky driving behavior data. The DF model integrates multi-grained scanning and cascade forest layers, enabling it to capture the complex relationship between risky driving behavior features. SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) are applied to interpret the model's predictions, including both SHAP summary and interaction results. Additionally, ablation studies are conducted to evaluate the contributions of key components like multi-grained scanning and cascade structures to the model's performance. The experimental results demonstrate that the DF model outperforms traditional machine learning models. The DF model achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.825, with a balanced Sensitivity of 0.75 and Specificity of 0.816, surpassing other models. The ablation studies show that removing multi-grained scanning, cascade layers, or completely random tree forest leads to performance declines, confirming the importance of each component. The SHAP analysis highlights that sharp acceleration and braking behaviors have the most significant impact on crash risk, offering clear, interpretable insights into how driving behaviors contribute to risk. Overall, the DF model's superior performance and SHAP-based interpretability provide a powerful tool for traffic safety management. These findings emphasize the value of incorporating both driving behavior intensity and model interpretability into crash risk prediction, offering practical applications for reducing crash rates. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Polymer-modified concrete (PMC) is an advanced building material with more excellent durability, tensile strength, adhesion, and lesser susceptibility to chemical degradation. Recent developments in machine learning (ML) have shown that prediction of compressive strength (CS) of PMC key input factors needed to obtain an optimized mix design are among the areas of applicability of ML. This study used eight machine learning models, which are Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, Bagging Regression, XG-Boost, Ada-Boost, Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting to predict compressive strength and perform SHAP (Shapley additive explanation) analysis. These hybrid predictive PMC models were developed using a wide-ranging dataset of 382 experimental data points compiled from the literature. A SHAP interaction plot was also used to show how each feature affected predictions on the model outputs. As highlighted in the results, hybrid models had significantly higher performance than conventional models, and the XG-Boost and decision tree model had the highest accuracy. In particular, the XG-Boost and decision tree model reached R2 scores of 0.987 for training and 0.577 for testing, proving its remarkable prediction ability for PMC compressive strength. The SHAP analysis confirmed that coarse aggregate, cement, and SCMs had the most significant influence on CS, with all other variables contributing lower values. The Partial Dependence Plots (PDP) analysis allowed a relatively simple interpretation of the contribution of individual inputs to the CS predictions. These results are useful for construction purposes and provide engineers and builders with first-hand knowledge and insight into the importance of individual components on PMC development and performance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) pose considerable challenges in the realm of cybersecurity, characterized by their evolving tactics and complex evasion techniques. These characteristics often outsmart traditional security measures and necessitate the development of more sophisticated detection methods. This study introduces Feature Evolution using Genetic Programming (FEGP), a novel method that leverages multi-tree Genetic Programming (GP) to construct and enhance features for APT detection. While GP has been widely utilized for tackling various problems in different domains, our study focuses on the adaptation of GP to the multifaceted landscape of APT detection. The proposed method automatically constructs discriminative features by combining the original features using mathematical operators. By leveraging GP, the system adapts to the evolving tactics employed by APTs, enhancing the identification of APT activities with greater accuracy and reliability. To assess the efficacy of the proposed method, comprehensive experiments were conducted on widely used and publicly accessible APT datasets. Using the combination of constructed and original features on the DAPT-2020 dataset, FEGP achieved a balanced accuracy of 79.28%, surpassing the best comparative methods by an average of 2.12% in detecting APT stages. Additionally, utilizing only constructed features on the Unraveled dataset, FEGP achieved a balanced accuracy of 83.14%, demonstrating a 3.73% improvement over the best comparative method. The findings presented in this paper underscore the importance of GP-based feature construction for APT detection, providing a pathway toward improved accuracy and efficiency in identifying APT activities. The comparative analysis of the proposed method against existing feature construction methods demonstrates FEGP's effectiveness as a state-of-the-art method for multi-class APT classification. In addition to the performance evaluation, further analysis was conducted, encompassing feature importance analysis, and a detailed time analysis. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The next-generation Internet of Things (NGIoT) is expected to incorporate emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence(AI), edge computing, augmented reality, tactile Internet, digital twin, 5G, and distributed ledgers. These technologies hold the potential to revolutionize a broad spectrum of IoT applications ranging from environmental monitoring to smart healthcare. In particular, these technologies are critical for advanced monitoring, processing, management, and medical service delivery in healthcare-centric IoT networks such as the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), Internet of Nano Things (IoNT), and Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT). Today, AI finds extensive application within decision support systems employed in the realm of IoMT; however, these systems are predominantly results-oriented and lack interpretability, posing concerns for medical professionals, patients, and the wider user community in trusting system decisions. In this paper, we propose an AI and virtual reality-supported audio and visual explainability framework, called MetaXAI, for intrusion detection in IoMT. MetaXAI presents the developed ML model decisions based on the ELI5, SHAP and LIME methods in a simulated 3D environment to the expert and the end user in an audible and visual way. Experimental results show that the MetaXAI framework can perform intrusion detection with a success rate of about 94% and effectively presents its decisions with rich and innovative 3D explanation interfaces. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Vision-based quality inspection is a key step to ensure the quality control of complex industrial products. However, accurate defect recognition for complex products with information-rich, structure-irregular and significantly different patterns is still a tough problem, since it causes the strong visual interference. This paper proposes a causal deep learning method (CDLM) to tackle the explainable vision-based quality inspection under visual interference. First, a structural causal model for defect recognition of complex industrial products is constructed and a causal intervention strategy to overcome the background interference is generated. Second, a defect-guided recognition neural network (DGRNN) is constructed, which can realize accurate defect recognition under the training of CDLM via feature-wise causal intervention using two sub-networks with feature difference mechanism. Finally, the causality between defect features and defective product labels can guide the DGRNN to complete the accurate and explainable learning of defect in a causal direction of optimization. Quantitative experiments show that the proposed method achieves recognition accuracy of 94.09% and 93.95% on two fabric datasets respectively, which outperforms the cutting-edge inspection models. Besides, Grad-CAM visualization experiments show that the proposed method successfully captures the data causality and realizes the explainable defect recognition. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Zero-shot image classification addresses the problem of non-overlapping categories between training and testing data. Human-annotated attributes are a commonly used form of auxiliary knowledge in zero-shot image classification. To assist experts in designing class attribute matrices, an interactive construction method is proposed, simplifying the tedious and unguided process. First, understandable attribute information is extracted from the training dataset images using a concept-based deep learning explainability method. Then, an interactive approach involving multi-view collaboration is employed to explore and analyze the importance of the extracted attributes. The system offers both global and local options to aid users in designing attribute values for testing dataset categories. Finally, the effectiveness and practicality of the design method are validated through case studies on the Animals with Attributes2 dataset and user evaluation experiments using the Likert scale, facilitating efficient and convenient class attribute construction for expert users. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In the hot-rolled process, the accurate hitting of strip thickness is key to production quality control. In this paper, a novel fusion strategy is proposed to address the problem that traditional thickness mechanism (TM) models and machine learning (ML) models have their own advantages and problems. A step-wise prediction framework for the fusion of mechanism and data is built by introducing the production requirements of enterprises. The construction of the framework begins with parsing the rolling mechanism and analyzing the data influence law. In order to ensure the model accuracy, the methods of model self-learning and feature engineering are individually introduced to construct TM and ML models, and they are stored in the model library. Subsequently, a kind of performance evaluation rule base is developed, based on practical applications in the industrial field. According to the order of importance of the accuracy, stability and timeliness indicators of the enterprise production requirement scheduling model, a step-wise prediction model (MCT) of ML compensation correction TM is established. In addition, considering the “black box” characteristic of ML, eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), especially the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method, is adopted to explain the prediction results of ML. Through the influence mechanism of transparent process parameters on strip thickness deviation, the key parameters are identified and the subsequent decision deployment is optimized. At the same time, the reasons for the appearance of anomalous prediction points of the model are diagnosed, and the improvement means are proposed by combining the rolling process mechanism and ML modeling. The experimental results show that compared with other traditional methods, the framework can better meet the production quality requirements and can provide a reference for practical industrial applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Agroecosystems have significant potential for carbon sequestration and are highly influenced by anthropogenic factors. However, the differences in carbon sink capacities between irrigated and rainfed agroecosystems, along with their underlying driving mechanisms, remain poorly understood. This study employed Innovative Trend Analysis and Breaks for Additive Seasonal and Trend to examine the trend characteristics and disparities in Net Ecosystem Productivity (NEP) across various global classifications of irrigated and rainfed agriculture. Advanced multi-model coupling techniques, such as Extreme Gradient Boosting, SHapley Additive exPlanations, and Generalized Additive Models, were utilized to explore the non-linear relationships between Net Primary Productivity (NPP), Heterotrophic Respiration (R<inf>h</inf>), and NEP with crucial explanatory variables. These models also helped identify positive and negative influence threshold effects and potential driving mechanisms. The results revealed an overall increasing trend (0.38 gC·m−2·year−1) in NEP across cropland in most regions (68.6%) globally from 1981 to 2019. On average, rainfed cropland exhibited higher NEP than irrigated cropland, although the annual rate of NEP increase was more significant for irrigated cropland. Notably, the largest abrupt changes in NEP across many cropland regions (65.0%) affected the asymptotic trends in subsequent years but did not reverse the direction of the preceding trends. The relationship between NEP and explanatory variables is predominantly non-linear, varying significantly across seasons and cropland types. Irrigation modifies the thresholds for both positive and negative effects of driving drivers on NEP. The intrinsic indicators, NPP and R<inf>h</inf>, contribute 62.1% and −37.9%, respectively, to changes in NEP. Human activities (73.2%) emerged as the primary influence on NEP, followed by atmospheric CO<inf>2</inf> concentrations (18.1%), with climate change (−3.3%) and vegetation dynamics (5.3%) having a lesser impact. This study advances our understanding of the disparities in carbon sink capacities between various irrigated and rainfed agroecosystem types on a global scale, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms that drive these differences. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Retrofitting building designs is crucial given the global aging infrastructure and increased in frequency of natural hazards like earthquakes. While traditional data-driven models are widely used for predicting building conditions, there has been limited exploration of recent artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in structural design. This study introduces a novel explainable AI framework that utilizes data-driven models for assessing, designing, and retrofitting of structures. The framework highlights the key global features of the model and further investigates them locally to adjust the input design parameters. It suggests the necessary changes in these inputs to achieve the desired structural performance. To achieve this, the framework employs interpretability techniques such as feature importance, feature interactions, Shapley Additive exPlanations, local interpretable model-agnostic explanations, partial dependence plot (PDP), and individual conditional expectation to highlight the important features. Additionally, a novel counterfactual) technique is applied for the first time as a design tool in seismic assessment and retrofitting of structures. The effectiveness of this framework is validated on a real benchmark structure through nonlinear time history analysis and natural earthquakes. The results show that the proposed framework is highly effective, especially under design-level earthquake conditions in achieving the necessary change in stiffness and strength of structures to meet the required seismic design objectives across different earthquake scenarios. This framework holds promise for wider adoption and applications in various other structural and civil engineering domains. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - To meet the difficulties of the current energy environment, hydrogen has enormous potential as a clean and sustainable energy source. Utilizing hydrogen's potential requires accurate hydrogen production prediction. Due to its capacity to identify intricate patterns in data, Machine learning alongside deep learning models has attracted considerable interest from a variety of industries, including the energy industry. Although these models yield an acceptable performance, there is still a need to improve their prediction results. Also, they are inherently black boxes, which makes it difficult to comprehend and interpret their predictions, particularly in important sectors like hydrogen generation. Sequel to the above, a sequential gated recurrent and self-attention network is proposed in this study to enhance hydrogen production prediction. The framework captures both sequential dependencies and contextual information enabling the model to effectively learn and represent temporal patterns in hydrogen production prediction. The biomass gasification dataset is used for the experiment including the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Coefficient of Determination (R2), Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (MSLE) and Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE) evaluation metrics. The proposed model recorded an optimal performance with an MAE of 0.102, MSE of 0.027, RMSE of 0.160, R2 of 0.999, MSLE of 0.001, and RMSLE of 0.030 based on K-cross validation. Among the input features, the percentage of plastics in the mixture(wt%) and RSS Particle Size(mm) are identified to be the most influential features in the proposed model prediction as identified by Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP), Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and Feature importance plot. With 99.99 % of the data points for H<inf>2</inf> production found within the range of reliability, the model demonstrates robust predictive capability with the majority of observations exerting minimal leverage (0 ≤ u ≤ [leverage threshold]) and limited influence (0 ≤ H ≤ [cooks' threshold]) on the predictive outcome using the modified William plot. Furthermore, various visualization approaches like Matthews correlation coefficient and Tarloy charts were adapted for the result explanations. The proposed model results were compared with state-of-the-art models exploring the significance of the proposed model in providing insights into the underlying mechanisms and factors influencing hydrogen production processes hence improving human understanding of the relationships between input factors and hydrogen production outputs as well as bridging the gap between predicted accuracy and interpretability. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding molecular traits through metabolomics offers an avenue to tailor cardiovascular prevention, diagnosis and treatment strategies more effectively. This study focuses on the application of machine learning (ML) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) algorithms to detect discriminant molecular signatures in heart failure (HF). We aim to uncover metabolites with significant predictive value by analyzing targeted metabolomics data through ML and XAI algorithms. After quality control, we analyzed 55 metabolites from 124 plasma samples, including 53 HF patients and 71 controls, comparing Ridge Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine and eXtreme Gradient Boosting models. All achieved high accuracy in predicting group labels: 84.0% [95% CI: 75.3 — 92.7], 85.73 [95% CI: 78.6 — 92.9], and 84.8% [95% CI: 76.1 – 93.5], respectively. Permutation-based variable importance and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) were used for group-level and individual-level explainability, respectively, complemented by H-Friedman statistics for variable interactions, yielding reliable, explainable insights of the ML models. Metabolites well-known for their association with HF, such as glucose and cholesterol, and more recently described, the C18:1 carnitine, were reaffirmed in our analysis. The novel discovery of lignoceric acid (C24:0 fatty acid) as a critical discriminator, was confirmed in a replication cohort, underscoring its potential as a metabolite marker. Furthermore, our study highlights the utility of 2-way variable interaction analysis in unveiling a network of metabolite interactions essential for accurate disease prediction. The results demonstrate our approach's efficacy in identifying key metabolites and their interactions, illustrating the power of ML and XAI in advancing personalized healthcare solutions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Digital twin models are of high interest to Head and Neck Cancer (HNC) oncologists, who have to navigate a series of complex treatment decisions that weigh the efficacy of tumor control against toxicity and mortality risks. Evaluating individual risk profiles necessitates a deeper understanding of the interplay between different factors such as patient health, spatial tumor location and spread, and risk of subsequent toxicities that can not be adequately captured through simple heuristics. To support clinicians in better understanding tradeoffs when deciding on treatment courses, we developed DITTO, a digital-twin and visual computing system that allows clinicians to analyze detailed risk profiles for each patient, and decide on a treatment plan. DITTO relies on a sequential Deep Reinforcement Learning digital twin (DT) to deliver personalized risk of both long-term and short-term disease outcome and toxicity risk for HNC patients. Based on a participatory collaborative design alongside oncologists, we also implement several visual explainability methods to promote clinical trust and encourage healthy skepticism when using our system. We evaluate the efficacy of DITTO through quantitative evaluation of performance and case studies with qualitative feedback. Finally, we discuss design lessons for developing clinical visual XAI applications for clinical end users. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The combined use of metro and bus (MBCT) enhances public transport accessibility and reduces CO<inf>2</inf> emissions. However, its emission reduction potential varies across trips. This study assesses trip-level CO<inf>2</inf> emission reductions of MBCT using interpretable machine learning. Smart card and bus operation data are integrated to infer complete origins and destinations (ODs). CO<inf>2</inf> emission savings are quantified by comparing MBCT with car travel for the same OD pairs. Various Gradient Boosting Machines (GBDT, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) model the nonlinear relationships between emission reduction and influencing factors, with methods of SHAP and PDP identifying key determinants. An empirical study in Shanghai reveals that MBCT reduces CO<inf>2</inf> emissions by 169.5 g/km on average. The reduction rate depends on trip characteristics and the built environment, with metro travel proportion and the non-linear coefficients being the most crucial factors. These findings offer insights for enhancing metro-bus integration and fostering low-carbon urban transport toward carbon neutrality. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Urban science aims to explain, discover, understand, and generalize (EDUG) complex, human-centric systems, emphasizing societal context and sustainability. However, integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into urban science presents challenges, including data availability, ethical considerations, and the ‘black-box’ nature of many AI models. Despite these limitations, AI offers significant opportunities for urban management and planning by leveraging vast, multimodal datasets to optimize infrastructure, predict trends, and enhance resilience. Techniques such as explainable AI and knowledge-driven approaches have begun addressing transparency concerns, aligning AI outputs with urban science’s emphasis on interpretability. Urban science reciprocally contributes to AI development by embedding contextual awareness and human-centric insights, enhancing AI’s ability to navigate urban complexities. Examples include digital twins for real-time urban analysis and generative AI for inclusive urban modelling. This opinion piece advocates for fostering a symbiotic relationship between AI and urban science, emphasizing co-learning and ethical collaboration. By integrating technical innovation with societal needs, the convergence of AI and urban science–termed the ‘New Urban Science’–promises smarter, equitable, and sustainable cities. This paradigm underscores the transformative potential of aligning AI advancements with urban science’s foundational goals. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Digital twin systems can benefit from the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for providing for example some predictive capabilities or supporting internal decision-making. As AI algorithms are often opaque, it becomes necessary to explain their decisions to a human operator working with the digital twin. In this study, we investigate the integration of explainable AI techniques with digital twins, which we termed XAI-DT system. We define the concept of XAI-DT system and provide a use case in smart buildings, where explainable AI is used to forecast CO<inf>2</inf> concentration. Further, we present a core architectural model for our digital twin, outlining its interaction with the smart building and its internal processing. We evaluate five AI algorithms and compare their explainability for the operator and the entire digital twin model based on standard explainability properties from the literature. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Predicting blast wave pressure is crucial for enhancing safety and response strategies in Internet of Vehicles (IoV) applications, particularly in the context of urban environments and high-risk areas. This paper presents a novel deep learning model designed for predicting blast frequencies in BLEVE (Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapor Explosion) scenarios. The article evaluates several activation functions, including ReLU, Mish, ELU, Silu, and Leaky ReLU, to determine their effectiveness in improving model accuracy. The results indicate that the Mish activation function achieves slightly lower Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) scores on the test dataset, with Train RMSE at 0.075 and Test RMSE at 0.099. The Silu activation function also demonstrates strong performance, yielding a Train RMSE of 0.074 and Test RMSE of 0.095, alongside high R2 scores, indicating a good fit to the data. The paper further explores the interpretability of the model's predictions using the LIME framework, revealing insights into how sensor positions and vapor heights influence blast frequency predictions. This research explores the potential of deep learning techniques in enhancing safety measures and predictive capabilities in hazardous scenarios, contributing valuable insights to the field of risk assessment and management in IoV applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - We present our approach to the COLING-2025 Regulations Challenge, which evaluates large language models (LLMs) on nine regulatory tasks, such as abbreviation recognition and financial data extraction. To address challenges like domain-specific terminologies and dynamic regulatory contexts, we developed a robust data construction pipeline, integrating proprietary Chinese regulatory data, Fin-GPT datasets, and financial Q&A data. The pipeline applied, but was not limited to, language filtering, semantic screening, and deduplication, resulting in a 30,000-example dataset combining financial regulations and general financial data. Using this dataset, we fine-tuned Llama 3.2-3B-Instruct to create Reg-LLaMA, a specialized model that outperformed baselines on the Regulations Challenge and PIXIU datasets. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of domain-specific data construction in advancing LLMs for regulatory tasks, paving the way for reliable and interpretable AI in regulated industries. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The increasing frequency and severity of wildfires worldwide have led to a pressing need for advanced fire detection systems. Recent research has demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), in wildfire detection using RGB images. However, the reliance on single color space limits the ability of fire detection models to generalize across diverse environmental conditions. This raises the question of why it is important to explore multiple color spaces: different color representations can capture distinct features of fire that are not visible in RGB alone, thereby improving detection robustness in varying environments. To answer this, we propose PyroChroma, an enhanced version of the MobileNetV2 architecture that incorporates additional convolution blocks and multiple color spaces (RGB, HSV, YCbCr, and grayscale) to capture a wider range of fire characteristics. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of PyroChroma against state-of-the-art models, employing transfer learning techniques to leverage pre-trained models in resource-constrained environments. Our results demonstrate that PyroChroma consistently outperforms existing models, achieving an accuracy of 99% and surpassing established architectures such as VGG16 (97%), ResNet50v2 (97%), and Xception (98%) in key metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score, even with limited training data. Furthermore, we integrate Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) into PyroChroma to provide visual explanations of the model’s decision-making process, enhancing interpretability. The combination of multi-color space analysis, architectural optimizations, and explainable AI techniques positions PyroChroma as a significant contribution to the field of wildfire detection, with the potential for real-world deployment in early warning systems for wildfire risk management. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Predicting the soil swelling index (C<inf>S</inf>) is crucial for geotechnical engineer to ensure the stability of civil engineering conceptions. Recently, ML models has sparked great interest from researchers in predicting the soil swelling index. However, due to the black-box nature of ML models, their prediction capabilities are still uninterpretable. This study aims to predict the soil swelling index using ML algorithms and interpret predictions. First, it employs the prediction capability of the Gaussian process regression (GPR) algorithm and compares it to the artificial neural network (ANN) for prediction the soil swelling index. Second, the SHAP algorithm as one recent explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) models is applied to interpret the predictions of the complex GPR and ANN models. The compiled experimental database covers 362 clayey samples gathered from different sites located in Northern Algeria. The modeling involved six input features, including the liquid limit (LL), plastic limit (PL), plasticity index (PI), water content (ω<inf>n</inf>), dry density (γ<inf>d</inf>), and void ratio (e) to predict the soil swelling index. The findings based on statistical metrics showed a good performance of GPR with R2 = 0.78 and of ANN with R2 = 0.79. Comparative study based on Wilcoxon signed-rank test and sign test indicated that the ANN outperform better than GPR. Based on the interpretations obtained by SHAP algorithm, it is observed that the liquid limit (LL) and plastic limit (PL) are the two main input features that influence the C<inf>S</inf>, indicating, the higher content of LL and PL increase the model's output. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Optimizing digital twins in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) requires secure and adaptable AI models. The IIoT enables digital twins, virtual replicas of physical assets, to improve real-time decision-making, but challenges remain in trust, data security, and model accuracy. This paper presents a novel framework combining blockchain technology and federated learning (FL) to address these issues. By deploying AI models on edge devices and using FL, data privacy is maintained while enabling collaboration across industrial assets. Blockchain ensures secure data management and transparency, while explainable AI (XAI) enhances interpretability. The framework improves transparency, control, security, privacy, and scalability for self-optimizing digital twins in IIoT. A real-world evaluation demonstrates the framework’s effectiveness in enhancing security, explainability, and optimization, offering improved efficiency and reliability for industrial operations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Data play a crucial role in decision making for modern businesses, and the reliability of these decisions highly depends on the data quality. This problem is particularly relevant when we deal with financial data used for risk assessment and reporting. Basel regulations mandate that banks hold a certain amount of capital based on the level of risk in their portfolios expressed in terms of risk-weighted assets (RWAs). The quality of a bank’s risk management is directly impacted by the quality of the asset data used to calculate RWAs. In this study, we present a data quality (DQ) framework and show how machine learning paired with eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques can be used to perform automatic DQ monitoring using a human-in-the-loop approach in credit risk. By obtaining expert feedback about model output enriched with XAI explanations, we clearly demonstrate the power of ML in terms of enhancing credit risk data quality and the advantages of using XAI to assist experts in analysing model outputs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The Plan Future Graph Visualization (PFG-Viz) project has been examining Explainable AI (XAI) and Human-AI Teaming (HAT) techniques which support the human planner. In the context of the creation of a set of plausible plans generated from an Artificial Intelligence (AI) planning system, these techniques support the goal to provide AI generated plans which are to be understood, assessed, modified, and approved by the human planner. The evaluation of the AI generated plans is built on a model and used to formulate a user interface. Phase One provided a hand-crafted baseline use case and scenario used to understand and constrain the variables and support an initial model for implementation and validation. A logistics-based land delivery scenario looks at a constrained set of routes from the departure point to delivery destinations. Metrics applied were distance, time, risk, and delivery point. The metrics were quantized for each plan trajectory. The model was based on a tree graph structure specifically designed for the use case, selected metrics, and consideration for scope and complexity. Phase Two is a continuation of examining the validation of the approach through use of digital twin simulation with an embedded Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP) AI algorithm. Instrumentation in the digital twin is used within the synthetic environment for data collection. Phase Two will also include a model of human interaction with the designed user interface using an application called IMPRINT. This will examine how the human planner can more effectively interact with the output of the AI planning system. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Fatigue poses significant risks to safety, productivity, and overall well-being. Traditional statistical methods have been employed for inferring fatigue-related patterns; however, there is a need for interpretable machine learning approaches that integrate time series prediction capabilities to develop intelligent health systems for fatigue management. This study explored forecasting perception and performance scores associated with fatigue using cardiac activity and heart rate variability (HRV), employing both generalized and personalized models with a 10-minute forecast interval during a cognitively fatiguing task. Participants underwent a two-hour working memory task while providing subjective fatigue responses every 10 min, serving as perception labels, and their performance within each 10-minute interval was quantified as their performance labels. The results revealed that performance-labeled models generated lower mean absolute errors compared to perception-labeled models, while the Gradient Boosting Regression algorithm achieved the lowest mean absolute error in forecasting performance scores due to fatigue for both generalized and personalized models. Sample entropy, ratio of Standard Deviation-Poincaré, the proportion of peak-to-peak intervals over 50 ms, coefficient of variation of peak-to-peak intervals, and low frequency were the most important features for predicting performance. These findings offer the potential to forecast performance decline resulting from fatigue in working memory tasks, facilitating the implementation of fatigue mitigation interventions to reduce injury risks and performance impairments. The integration of interpretable machine learning methods with time series forecasting provides valuable insights for developing intelligent systems that proactively manage fatigue and optimize performance across various domains. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Although deep neural networks exhibiting superior performance across numerous tasks, their application in high-risk domains is limited by a lack of interpretability and trustworthiness. In this paper, an interaction value calculation method is firstly proposed, which faithfully represents the interaction utility of each variable in the feature map. Secondly, an interpretable method for top-down construction of interaction hierarchy graph based on interaction utility is proposed to understand the visualized knowledge represented by filters and to elucidate the decision-making process of the network. Extensive experiments were carried out on publicly available datasets and models that had been pre-trained. Experimental results indicate that each node in the graph consistently corresponds to the same part of an object across various images belonging to the same category. The faithfulness evaluation shows that the filters involved in the graph nodes have a major role in the network. Furthermore, the quantitative evaluation shows that our method improves over the others by an average of 0.18%, 1.19%, and 2.18% on the EBPG, mIoU, and Bbox metrics, respectively. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Rapid urbanization has intensified urban heat island (UHI) effects, highlighting the need to understand UHI drivers to improve local thermal environments. While previous research has shown Urban spatial morphology significantly influences land surface temperature (LST), the mechanisms and characteristics of this impact across different geographic conditions remain unclear. Based on this, we selected the main urban areas of Chengdu and Lhasa as examples, using machine learning models and Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) method to reveal the linear and nonlinear relationships between Urban spatial morphology and LST from a morphological perspective. The results show that: (1) The built environment has the most significant impact on LST in plain cities, while the morphology of green space more strongly regulates LST in plateau cities. (2) Building height and density of core both reflect a role in reducing LST in plateau cities. (3) The interaction mechanisms of building density and building height features show the same trend in both plain and plateau cities. However, density of branch between 0.1 and 0.2 reduces LST in plain cities, while densities below 0.1 are more effective in reducing LST in plateau cities. Our results can provide refined and differentiated references for urban planners dedicated to mitigating UHI. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Agriculture is one of the fundamental components of human civilization, contributing not only to food production but also to economic growth. Early identification of diseases in plants presents a significant challenge, as timely identification is crucial to increasing agricultural production. Incorporating the latest technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, in fields can reduce major losses for farmers and also improve productivity. In this paper, we have proposed a Deep Vision transformer and an Explainable AI (XAI)-based technique to address various diseases in plants. Here, we have used the dataset “Plant Village" as a case study that focuses on two majorly grown crops like: potatoes and tomatoes. In addition, we have analysed nine diseases that affect these crops around the world, with tomatoes showing six different conditions and potatoes affected by three bacterial diseases. The proposed DVTXAI framework incorporates the Deep vision transforms to identify plant diseases at an early stage. In the experiments, the proposed model achieves an accuracy of 93.56% for tomatoes and 99.95% for potatoes. Additionally, to make model ‘Trustworthy’, we make model Explainable, which reveals the transparency mechanism that helps the farmer to make the right decision at an early stage of the crop. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The integration of predictive quality and eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) in product quality classification marks a significant advancement in quality control processes. This study examines the application of Machine Learning (ML) models and XAI techniques in managing product quality, using a case study in the agri-food industry quality as an example. Predictive quality models leverage historical and real-time data to anticipate potential quality issues, thereby improving detection accuracy and efficiency. XAI ensures transparency and interpretability, facilitating trust in the model’s decisions. This combination enhances quality management, supports informed decision-making, and ensures regulatory compliance. The case study demonstrates how ML models, particularly Artificial Neural Network (ANN), can accurately predict product quality, with XAI providing clarity on the reasoning behind these predictions. The study suggests future research directions, such as expanding datasets, exploring advanced ML techniques, implementing real-time monitoring, and integrating sensory analysis, to further improve the accuracy and transparency of quality control in various industries. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) is an interpretable neural network that leverages high-level concepts to explain model decisions and conduct human-machine interaction. However, in real-world scenarios, the deficiency of informative concepts can impede the model's interpretability and subsequent interventions. This paper proves that insufficient concept information can lead to an inherent dilemma of concept and label distortions in CBM. To address this challenge, we propose the Decoupling Concept Bottleneck Model (DCBM), which comprises two phases: 1) DCBM for prediction and interpretation, which decouples heterogeneous information into explicit and implicit concepts while maintaining high label and concept accuracy, and 2) DCBM for human-machine interaction, which automatically corrects labels and traces wrong concepts via mutual information estimation. The construction of the interaction system can be formulated as a light min-max optimization problem. Extensive experiments expose the success of alleviating concept/label distortions, especially when concepts are insufficient. In particular, we propose the Concept Contribution Score (CCS) to quantify the interpretability of DCBM. Numerical results demonstrate that CCS can be guaranteed by the Jensen-Shannon divergence constraint in DCBM. Moreover, DCBM expresses two effective human-machine interactions, including forward intervention and backward rectification, to further promote concept/label accuracy via interaction with human experts. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The accurate identification and classification of rice species is critical for increasing crop productivity, quality, and diversity. Traditional rice classification methods involving manual inspection can be time-consuming, costly, and error-prone. This study addresses to address this challenge by exploring the potential of machine learning (ML) models for automated and accurate rice classification. The key objectives of this paper are threefold. First, the study evaluates the discriminative power of various morphological features extracted from rice grain images using feature selection methods. Second, it compares the performance of several ML models, including Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), Gradient Boosting (GBoost), k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN), Logistic Regression (LR), Naïve Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), in classifying two rice species (Cammeo and Osmancik). Third, the study implements explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, namely SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) and Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots, to provide transparency and interpretability into the inner workings and decision-making processes of the ML models. The findings indicate that the LR model achieved the highest classification accuracy, with a rate of 93.1%. Feature analysis identified Major Axis Length, Perimeter, Convex Area, and Area as the most influential features in distinguishing between rice species. This study highlights the successful application of advanced ML techniques in automating industrial rice classification, facilitating automated packaging and quality control processes without the need for human intervention. By improving the efficiency of rice classification and reducing reliance on manual labour, this approach offers significant benefits to both the agricultural industry and food production sectors. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In-situ monitoring is crucial for enhancing process quality control in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). Currently, data-driven approaches in LPBF in-situ quality monitoring have shown remarkable success. However, existing data-driven methods often lack integration with physical knowledge, leading to the opacity of decision-making processes. Research on LPBF knowledge-data mixed-driven modeling is still relatively scarce. To address this gap, this paper proposes a deep graph network method guided by prior knowledge (MK-DGNet) for in-situ quality inspection based on coaxial melt pool images. In the proposed method, prior knowledge is first extracted based on understanding of melt pool. Then, the fusion module is used to place images and knowledge vectors in the same dimensional space. Finally, a deep graph network architecture is elaborately established, taking graph-formatted data as input to learn deep-layer relationships between nodes and edges. The superiority of MK-DGNet is demonstrated using publicly available NIST datasets and self-built CMPQ dataset. Additionally, explainable artificial intelligence methods are employed to explain the basis of network decisions and the effectiveness of prior knowledge. This research provides new methods and perspectives for addressing quality issues in the LPBF process. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Forecasting errors in power markets, even as small as 1%, can have significant financial implications. However, even high-performance artificial intelligence (AI) based electricity price forecasting (EPF) models have instances when their prediction error is much higher than those shown by mean performance metrics. To date, explainable AI has been used to enhance the model transparency and trustworthiness of AI-based EPF models. However, this article demonstrates that insights from explainable AI (XAI) techniques can be expanded beyond its primary task of explanatory visualizations. This work presents a XAI-based error compensation approach to improve model performance and identify irregular predictions. The first phase of the proposed approach involves error quantification through a Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) based corrector model that fine-tunes the base predictor's forecasts. Using this corrector model's SHAP explanations, the proposed approach distinguishes high-accuracy predictions from lower ones in the second stage. Additionally, these explanations are more simplified than the base model, making them easier for nonexpert users such as bidding agents. Performance enhancement and insightful user-centric explanations are crucial for real-world scenarios such as price spikes during network congestion, high renewable penetration, and fluctuating fuel costs. Case studies discussed here show the efficacy of the proposed approach independent of model architecture, feature combination, or behavioral patterns of electricity prices in different markets. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Bottleneck detection and management plays a significant role in the context of Industry 4.0, wherein process chains have become more intricate. The dynamic nature of process chains shifts the bottleneck location, which requires an integrated methodology capable of identifying current as well as predicting future bottlenecks. The paper proposes a cognitive digital twin (CDT) with a novel explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) model. The proposed CDT is capable of (i) detecting existing bottlenecks, (ii) detecting data anomalies and process chain anomalies (iii) estimating shifting bottlenecks due to anomalies, (iv) predicting near future bottlenecks, and (v) the XAI model supports operational and strategic decision making. The usefulness of proposed CDT is demonstrated and validated experimentally on an industry 4.0 compliant learning factory. The proposed novel CDT effectively addresses the process chain bottlenecks (existing, shifting, and future) while the XAI model enhances transparency and trustworthiness for practical implementation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Machine learning is used widely to create a range of prediction or classification models. The quality of the machine learning (ML) models depends not only on the model creation process, but also on the input data quality. We investigate here the impact of data quality on the quality of the ML model in a generic way. The aim is to identify a possible data quality problem based on observed anomalies in the ML model over time. This is achieved in the form of a root cause analysis of anomalies detected in the ML model. We develop a generic anomaly detection and analysis framework and demonstrate its application to two prediction scenarios based on sensor data. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - There is a direct correlation between noise and human health, while negative consequences may vary from sleep disruption and stress to hearing loss and reduced productivity. Despite its undeniable relevance, the underlying process governing the relationship between unpleasant sound events, and the annoyance they may cause has not been systematically studied yet. In this context, this work focuses on the disturbance caused by interfloor sound events, i.e., the audio signals transmitted through the floors of a building. Activities such as walking, running, using household appliances or other daily actions generate sounds that can be heard by those on an adjacent floor. To this end, we implemented a suitable dataset including diverse interfloor sound events annotated according to the perceived disturbance. Subsequently, we propose a framework able to quantify similarities exhibited by interfloor sound events starting from standardized time-frequency representations, which are processed by a Siamese neural network composed of a series of convolutional layers. Such similarities are then employed by a k-medoids regression scheme making disturbance predictions based on interfloor sound events with neighboring latent representations. After thorough experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of such a framework and its superiority over popular regression algorithms. Last but not least, the proposed solution offers interpretable predictions, which may be meaningfully utilized by human experts. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study introduces a data-centric framework for end-to-end supply chain resilience management. With major disruptions such as pandemics profoundly affecting industries and regions, a wealth of data capturing diverse disruption scenarios has emerged. This presents an opportunity to correlate deviations in organizational operations with disruption outcomes, reducing reliance on external supplier data and alleviating associated data privacy concerns. Utilizing deep learning, survival analysis, and explainable artificial intelligence, the research represents a pioneering advancement in translating readily accessible organizational data into forecasts of disruption risks and sources, differing from traditional model-centric methodologies. The application of this framework to a real-world scenario based on a U.S. automotive manufacturer resulted in accurately predicting the time-to-survive for critical parts, with a prediction error of under 20 days for half-year-ahead shortage forecasts. Notably, the model achieved a 50% reduction in error rates for near-term and long-term predictions compared to the best-performing alternative models. Our findings underscore the framework's ability to effectively address the complexities of global supply chain disruptions and unknown-unknown uncertainties by harnessing insights gleaned from internal operational data. This accumulated knowledge enables real-time risk identification and assessment, empowering organizations to deploy timely and targeted risk mitigation strategies for enhancing overall supply chain resilience. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study explores the application of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in the context of medical image analysis within medical cyber-physical systems (MCPS) to enhance transparency and trustworthiness. Meanwhile, this study proposes an explainable framework that integrates machine learning and knowledge reasoning. The explainability of the model is realized when the framework evolution target feature results and reasoning results are the same and are relatively reliable. However, using these technologies also presents new challenges, including the need to ensure the security and privacy of patient data from Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Therefore, attack detection is an essential aspect of MCPS security. For the MCPS model with only sensor attacks, the necessary and sufficient conditions for detecting attacks are given based on the definition of sparse observability. The corresponding attack detector and state estimator are designed by assuming that some IoMT sensors are under protection. It is expounded that the IoMT sensors under protection play an important role in improving the efficiency of attack detection and state estimation. The experimental results show that the XAI in the context of medical image analysis within MCPS improves the accuracy of lesion classification, effectively removes low-quality medical images, and realizes the explainability of recognition results. This helps doctors understand the logic of the system's decision-making and can choose whether to trust the results based on the explanation given by the framework. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Bricks have long been a fundamental material in construction, appreciated for their durability, strength, and versatility. Even with advancements in modern building technologies, bricks remain a top choice due to their excellent thermal insulation, fire resistance, and diverse design possibilities. In countries like Bangladesh, bricks are classified into three grades (Grade One, Grade Two, and Grade Three), each suited for different purposes. However, traditional manual grading methods are often inconsistent and labor-intensive, necessitating more efficient solutions. This study introduces an enhanced brick grading system using a customized DenseNet-169 model, named BrickNet. By leveraging transfer learning combined with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, our method improves both the accuracy and interpretability of brick classification. We utilize Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to provide transparent visual explanations for the model’s predictions, thereby increasing transparency. Our experiments, which include a comparison with six pre-trained deep learning (DL) models, namely DenseNet-169, MobileNet-v2, ResNet-50, VGG-19, Xception, Inception-v3, reveal that hyperpararmeter-optimized DenseNet-169 model (BrickNet) achieves a maximum accuracy of 97.33% with minimal loss. This research underscores the effectiveness of automated grading in surpassing traditional methods and offers a promising advancement for the brick classification process in the construction sector. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A literature review on AI applications in the field of railway safety shows that the implemented approaches mainly concern the operational, maintenance, and feedback phases following railway incidents or accidents. These approaches exploit railway safety data once the transport system has received authorization for commissioning. However, railway standards and regulations require the development of a safety management system (SMS) from the specification and design phases of the railway system. This article proposes a new AI approach for analyzing and assessing safety from the specification and design phases of the railway system with a view to improving the development of the SMS. Unlike some learning methods, the proposed approach, which is dedicated in particular to safety assessment bodies, is based on semi-supervised learning carried out in close collaboration with safety experts who contributed to the development of a database of potential accident scenarios (learning example database) relating to the risk of rail collision. The proposed decision support is based on the use of an expert system whose knowledge base is automatically generated by inductive learning in the form of an association rule (rule base) and whose main objective is to suggest to the safety expert possible hazards not considered during the development of the SMS to complete the initial hazard register. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Potatoes are one of the most important food crops globally, yet their susceptibility to a wide range of diseases poses a serious threat to agricultural productivity. Conventional methods for identifying potato diseases are labor-intensive and time-consuming, underscoring the need for more advanced solutions. Deep learning has emerged as a promising alternative, outperforming traditional methods with its ability to automate and enhance potato disease identification. However, previous research has primarily focused on single-dataset implementations, and the interpretability of these models remains insufficiently explored. To address this, we introduce a solution that combined the strengths of ensemble deep learning and Explainable AI (XAI) for the identification of potato leaf pests and diseases. Our ensemble model integrates MobileNetV3-Large and EfficientNetV2B3 architectures and demonstrates remarkable accuracy of 97.91%. Furthermore, the incorporation of XAI techniques greatly enhances the interpretability of the model. By improving both interpretability and predictive accuracy, these results support more informed and reliable model outputs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In line with the AI-native 6G vision, explainability and robustness are crucial for building trust and ensuring reliable performance in millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems. Efficient beam alignment is essential for initial access, but deep learning (DL) solutions face challenges, including high data collection overhead, hardware constraints, lack of explainability, and susceptibility to adversarial attacks. This paper proposes a robust and explainable DL-based beam alignment engine (BAE) for mmWave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The BAE uses received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements from wide beams to predict the best narrow beam, reducing the overhead of exhaustive beam sweeping. To overcome the challenge of real-world data collection, this work leverages a site-specific digital twin (DT) to generate synthetic channel data closely resembling real-world environments. A model refinement via transfer learning is proposed to fine-tune the pre-trained model residing in the DT with minimal real-world data, effectively bridging mismatches between the digital replica and real-world environments. To reduce beam training overhead and enhance transparency, the framework uses deep Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) to rank input features by importance, prioritizing key spatial directions and minimizing beam sweeping. It also incorporates the Deep k-nearest neighbors (DkNN) algorithm, providing a credibility metric for detecting out-of-distribution inputs and ensuring robust, transparent decision-making. Experimental results show that the proposed framework reduces real-world data needs by 70%, beam training overhead by 62%, and improves outlier detection robustness by up to 8.5×, achieving near-optimal spectral efficiency and transparent decision making compared to traditional softmax based DL models. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study introduces an Explainable AI (XAI) framework leveraging Capsule Networks (CapsNet) for credit risk assessment in financial systems. Traditional credit risk models often prioritize predictive accuracy over interpretability, creating challenges in stakeholder trust and regulatory compliance. CapsNet addresses this by maintaining spatial relationships in data while offering robust predictive capabilities. The proposed framework integrates data preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values and balancing imbalanced datasets, ensuring reliable inputs for CapsNet. Explainability is enhanced through Capsule Activation Vectors and attention mechanisms, elucidating the influence of critical features like income, loan amount, and credit history on predictions. The study employs SHAP values to identify key determinants of loan default, with income emerging as the most significant predictor. Experimental results validate CapsNet's superior performance, achieving 90% accuracy and F1-score, outperforming models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest. Additionally, the framework provides interpretative insights into model decisions, fostering transparency and trust. This work represents a significant step towards integrating explainable AI into credit risk management, ensuring compliance with financial regulations while improving operational efficiency and decision-making in the banking sector. By addressing the dual challenges of accuracy and interpretability, this research demonstrates how XAI frameworks can transform financial systems, supporting ethical and knowledge-based practices. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

It is essential to adopt innovative approaches in design, analysis, and management as constructions become increasingly complex and projects expand in scale. Consequently, structural engineering today is progressively recognizing the potential for AI to bring about significant changes. The dominant approaches to design have largely been iterative, with certain cases involving the application of manual calculations. Nonetheless, it is essential to adopt a more analytical perspective in light of contemporary frameworks and transformations across different sectors. Artificial intelligence and its four types are widely utilized today, encompassing machine learning, data analytics, and cognitive computing. The various aspects of structural engineering can be enhanced through the analysis of computational data, the identification of patterns within extensive data sets, and the formulation of unique decisions. Consequently, this paper examines the various applications of structural engineering through the lens of AI. Fields including predictive modeling, health monitoring, seismic analysis, construction, and various other domains are encompassed within the scope of the examination. Nonetheless, certain drawbacks must be acknowledged, such as data limitations, restricted model interpretability, and resource constraints. Nonetheless, suggestions for tackling the issues have been presented, including explainable AI, data synthesis, and integrated educational models. The study aims to deliver comprehensive insights into the influence of AI on structural engineering, emphasizing its role in fostering the creation of safer and environmentally friendly structures. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The precise estimation of the shear strength of reinforced concrete (RC) beams constructed with recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) is essential for the secure and sustainable design of structural components. The utilization of construction and demolition waste (CDW) to produce recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) is an attractive approach from both an environmental and budgetary perspective. However, this study proposes a single and novel hybrid machine learning framework to predict the shear strength of RAC beams using a dataset compiled from published experimental studies and validated numerical models. Ensemble learning techniques such as Support Vector Regression (SVR), Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT), CatBoost, Decision Tree (DT), and Bagging Regressor (BR) were developed to train models using six input features: 28-day compressive strength of concrete (fc), the percentage of recycled coarse aggregate (RCA), the effective depth of the beam cross-section (d), the width of the beam cross-section (b), the percentage of longitudinal reinforcement (rhow), the shear span to effective depth ratio (a/d) and output parameter is the shear strength of the specimen (V<inf>test</inf>). Furthermore, evaluating model performance, we used R2, RMSE, MAPE, and MAE metrics on a robust database that was divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) phases. Results show that the hybrid models outperform standalone algorithms, with the hybrid GBRT model combination achieving the highest prediction accuracy throughout both stages using R2 (0.869, 0.998), RMSE, MAE, and MAPE (20.033, 12.753, and 15.598%), respectively. Additionally, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis was employed to determine significant input characteristics and clarify how they affect the Beam Shear Strength Prediction. The presence of the width of the beam cross-section and the shear span to effective depth ratio contributes the highest positive influence to the outcome. This study demonstrates that hybrid ML approaches can reliably capture nonlinear interactions among RAC beam variables, offering a powerful alternative to empirical formulas. Moreover, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) was developed to enable designers to effectively and economically forecast beam shear strength, and the experimental findings substantially impact the construction industry by facilitating a more accurate and reliable implementation of RAC. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Focusing on anomaly detection in industrial control systems and critical infrastructures, this study discusses the potential integration of digital twin (DT) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) technologies. While digital twins create virtual copies of physical systems, allowing monitoring and simulating system behaviors; XAI makes the decision processes of anomaly detection systems transparent, making operator interventions more effective. In the literature, it is stated that digital twins are generally used in technically focused applications, but there are deficiencies in cybersecurity and transparency. In addition, hybrid approaches developed by combining supervised and unsupervised learning methods provide high accuracy rates in anomaly detection. This study focuses on how XAI methods are used to increase security, especially in critical infrastructures, and how these technologies can be integrated with cyber resilience in the future. In addition, the diversity of data sets and models used emphasizes the importance of different methodological approaches for each application area. Finally, it is stated that this study aims to provide a resource that will guide new research areas and technological integrations in anomaly detection and security strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Abstract: Spoilage in processed meat products, such as poultry and pork sausages, presents significant challenges for food safety, quality control, and waste reduction. This study presents a machine learning-based framework to classify spoilage intensity levels using sensory, physicochemical, and microbiological features. To overcome limitations caused by small datasets, we applied synthetic data augmentation using a tabular variational autoencoder (TVAE) to generate high-fidelity samples that enhance model generalization. Additionally, traditional oversampling techniques such as SMOTE and ADASYN were employed for comparative purposes and to further address class imbalance issues. Seven machine learning classifiers were evaluated logistic regression, support vector machine, K-nearest neighbors, random forest, gradient boosting, voting classifier, and multilayer perceptron. The best classification performance was achieved when models were trained on GAN-based synthetic data and tested on real samples. For poultry sausage spoilage prediction, the gradient boosting classifier reached the highest accuracy of 97%. For pork sausages, random forest achieved the highest accuracy of 95%. These results confirm the effectiveness of data augmentation in improving predictive robustness. To ensure model transparency, we integrated explainable AI techniques SHAP and LIME into the pipeline. These analyses revealed that sampling time, CO2 concentration, pH, and microbial species such as Lactobacillus curvatus and Leuconostoc carnosum were among the most influential features in spoilage prediction. The combination of synthetic data generation and interpretable machine learning enables a reliable, scalable, and explainable approach to spoilage classification. This methodology has strong potential for enhancing quality control systems in the meat industry while reducing waste and improving safety along the food supply chain. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cost functions serve as the backbone of machine learning models, guiding optimization processes and significantly influencing predictive accuracy and model generalization. This review presents a comprehensive analysis of cost function design and application across a broad spectrum of engineering and applied science domains, including manufacturing, structural mechanics, computational design, biomechanics, reinforcement learning, and construction management. By synthesizing insights from 20 recent studies, the paper explores how cost functions are formulated, adapted, and optimized to suit complex, domain-specific challenges - ranging from estimating machining costs using explainable AI to learning physical laws via energy-based deep learning methods. Special attention is given to the integration of traditional engineering knowledge into data-driven models, the role of interpretability in cost function design, and the emergence of hybrid frameworks combining physical simulation with neural architectures. This work highlights both the diversity and convergence of cost function methodologies, identifies trends in scalable and interpretable modeling, and outlines research directions for the development of adaptive, data-efficient, and context-aware cost functions in engineering applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Air pollution is a critical concern in urban environments due to its impact on public health and quality of life. A real-time air quality monitoring and prediction model is introduced that integrates Internet of Things (IoT) sensors with Machine Learning (ML) models to detect and predict pollutant concentrations. The system collects data on nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O3) using MQ-7, MQ-136, MQ-9, and MQ-131 sensors, along with DHT11 for temperature and humidity. The data is preprocessed to train ML models, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Classifier. The Decision Tree model achieved the highest accuracy of 99.68% in predicting pollutant levels. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, such as LIME, are employed to interpret prediction results enhancing model transparency and building user trust. A web-based dashboard visualizes real-time data and prediction outputs, enabling policymakers, environmental agencies, and the public to make informed decisions. The proposed system offers a scalable and interpretable solution for proactive urban air quality management. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Customs risk rule generation is crucial for enhancing regulatory effectiveness. Existing methods over-rely on manual experience, making them difficult to cope with dynamic risks, and generally suffer from insufficient interpretability and lagging updates. To address these issues, this paper innovatively proposes a Semantic-Enhanced and Knowledge-Driven Rule Representation Learning framework (SEKD-RRL) for intelligent generation of customs risk rules. The core contributions of SEKD-RRL are: First, it designs a semantic enhancement module that integrates a semantic encoder into rule representation learning, effectively improving the model’s semantic understanding of unstructured customs texts and overcoming the limitations of traditional methods in text processing. Second, it constructs a knowledge-driven logical layer, fusing semantic similarity knowledge with a customs domain knowledge graph, realizing the transition from hard logical rules to soft logical rules, and significantly enhancing the domain knowledge relevance and interpretability of the generated rules. The SEKD-RRL framework mainly consists of a semantic enhancement module, a knowledge-driven logical layer, and a rule representation learning module. Experiments on a simulated customs dataset demonstrate that SEKD-RRL achieves a dual improvement in classification performance and interpretability in risk rule generation, and exhibits advantages in rule accuracy, simplicity, and expert evaluation. The research validates the effectiveness of the SEKD-RRL framework in the customs risk rule generation task, provides a technical path for building a new generation of intelligent customs risk regulation systems, and offers a reference for research in areas such as semantic-enhanced rule learning and knowledge-driven intelligent decision-making. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Earthquakes are among the most destructive natural disasters that constantly threaten human life. Therefore, taking preventive measures is essential. Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) can potentially improve Earthquake Disaster Risk Management (EDRM), its current applications, challenges, and research gaps remain insufficiently explored. This study investigates the application of AI in earthquake-related disaster risk management (AI-EDRM). It systematically analyses the distribution of DRM phases and sub-phases, AI types, subfields, and problem categories. Moreover, it evaluates commonly used AI applications and algorithms, examines data types and methodological approaches in earthquake studies, and identifies significant challenges and research gaps. To this end, a systematic review of 55 articles indexed in Scopus and Web of Science was conducted. Python was used for data processing and visualisation. Findings reveal that AI-EDRM research has become increasingly diversified. However, while most studies focus on post-disaster response, the recovery phase remains underexplored. The most commonly studied AI-EDRM sub-processes include damage assessment, forecasting and prediction, whereas planning and risk awareness are neglected. The main challenge is the lack of high-quality and well-integrated data. Key research gaps include limited integration of heterogeneous data sources and underutilisation of advanced AI models. Future directions emphasise the development of generalised datasets, multimodal data fusion, advanced AI architectures, and hybrid approaches. Moreover, there is a need for decision support systems aligned with local governance strategies, incorporating explainable AI (XAI) and fuzzy inference systems (FIS) to enhance transparency and manage uncertainty. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The applications of high-hardness refractory alloys in fields such as aerospace, nuclear energy, and the chemical industry are growing, driving the demand for new alloy designs. This paper aims to effectively predict the hardness of Ti-Zr-Nb-Ta alloys through the construction of machine learning models, so as to accelerate the development of new high-hardness alloys. The ETR model exhibits the highest prediction accuracy and the smallest error in both the training set and the test set, and shows good generalization ability on unknown data. Through PCC and MIC analysis, RMS_R, T<inf>m</inf>, ENC, and APE are determined as the key features affecting the hardness of the alloy. Given that the small size of the original dataset affects the accuracy, data augmentation using a generative model was carried out, and the model accuracy was significantly improved when 200 generated data points were added. Subsequently, based on the high-precision model, the SHAP theory has been further introduced for interpretive analysis, and the results showed that the feature importance ranking is RMS_R, ENC, T<inf>m</inf>, and APE. An increase in RMS_R and ENC, an elevation in T<inf>m</inf>, and a decrease in APE all contribute to improving the hardness of the alloy. Based on the predictions of the machine learning model, it is determined that, in the Ti-Zr-Nb-Ta alloy, adding approximately 0.35 at.% of Ta and 0.35–0.45 at.% of Zr can achieve a hardness higher than 500 HV. In addition, considering features such as atomic size difference, effective charge number, melting point, and electronegativity, Cr, Mo, W, and Hf have been finally selected as new alloying elements to construct the Ti-Zr-Nb-Ta-X (X = Cr, Mo, W, Hf) alloy system, so as to accelerate the design of new high-hardness alloys. These research results provide an important theoretical basis and practical guidance for the development of high-performance refractory alloys in the future. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Shared bicycles are becoming increasingly popular as a primary mode of micro-mobility due to easy accessibility in urban areas and ability to integrate with other public transportation systems. Understanding the travel patterns and modal characteristics of shared bicycles is essential for developing sustainable and eco-friendly urban transportation systems. Although the recent advance of GeoAIs has enabled the exploration of complex, nonlinear relationships in shared mobility patterns, these studies often provide a temporally aggregated view. Consequently, they tend to overlook the dynamics of these nonlinear effects, specifically how the influence of built environment, demographic, and public transit factors shifts across different times of day and seasons. This study addresses this gap by emphasizing a LightGBM model enhanced with a robust SHapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) framework, explicitly capturing these nonlinear effects and distinguishing spatiotemporal dynamics. As an empirical case study, we examine the shared bicycle system in Seoul. The findings reveal distinct differences in travel patterns and influencing factors between weekdays and weekends. Also, it is empirically shown that shared bicycles can be served mainly as an alternative means of connecting the first- and last-mile gaps, effectively integrating with the public transportation network. This study contributes to clarify personal mobility patterns and inform sustainable transport policy by demonstrating shared bicycles’ urban potential. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Federated learning has emerged as a powerful solution in network intrusion detection, proving highly effective in countering sophisticated attacks. This work delves into the intricate workings of a federated system, exploring its capabilities through a structured, three-stage workflow. The first stage involved data exploration, followed by model construction and testing, where critical parameters such as training epochs, data partitioning, and data proportions were adjusted to evaluate their impact on the model’s performance. In the final stage, feature exploration, an explainable AI framework was employed to assess feature contributions, with the premise that models utilizing the same dataset should assign similar importance to key features. A comparison between the centralized and federated models was conducted, revealing that both approaches aligned closely in their feature interpretations. Explainable AI brought enhanced transparency, ensuring that the model’s decision-making was consistent with practical, real-world reasoning. In conclusion, this study highlights the robustness of federated models in intrusion detection, offering valuable insights into their parameter optimization and confirming their potential as a reliable alternative to centralized systems. We have utilized CICIDS 2017 dataset to evaluate and demonstrate the results. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Evaluation of embryo quality is crucial for the success of implantation and the rate of live birth in assisted reproductive technologies. Traditional morphological assessments are limited to the observer's experience. This study explores the application of various machine learning techniques, such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression, to predict embryo viability and in vitro fertilization outcomes. A set of preprocessing activities was performed to handle missing embryological characteristics, encode categorical variables, and transform complex data formats into usable characteristics in the dataset. The best model was Random Forest which demonstrated robust predictive capabilities achieving a precision of 98.71 % and the lowest false positive rate with 0.58 %. The Shapley Additive Explanations algorithm allowed to identify key predictors such as embryo quality scores, patient age, and BMI enhancing explainability, providing a balance between model performance and clinical interpretability. These findings highlight the transformative potential of machine learning in reproductive medicine by providing precise, transparent, and scalable tools for embryo evaluation and prediction of In Vitro Fertilization-IVF outcomes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cyber-attacks in mobile cloud environments are causes of security concerns nowadays. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play a key role in enhancing the security of cloud systems. However, traditional techniques contribute towards fine IDS; they face several issues such as higher complexity, higher computational resource utilization, lower interpretability, and many more. To mitigate these issues, the given paper introduces an ontology-based explainable IDS equipped with a knowledge base (ontology) and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) methodology for interpreting the model’s performance. The proposed system involves ontology construction belonging to different categories of attacks in the given network. The designed ontology is treated as a knowledge base for representing concepts and relationships between nodes in the given network. It acts as a powerful tool to detect intrusions in the given network, followed by the LIME explanation mechanism, thus enabling interpretable, instance-specific explanations. Lastly, the performance of the proposed IDS is assessed and validated with existing studies based on metrics such as accuracy (%), precision (%), and recall (%). © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Rapid and precise product dimension measurement is essential for enabling complete enumeration inspection, ensuring product reliability, and ultimately achieving factory automation. In particular, injection molding enables rapid and cost-effective production, making it well-suited for mass production. Thus, rapid and precise measurement is essential for inspecting the quality of all injection-molded products. However, complex 3D geometry and easily deformable property of axial fan hinder rapid and accurate measurement, thereby reducing quality control efficiency. This study introduces a convolutional neural network-based vision inspection system that can enhance the productivity and quality of injection-molded products by overcoming the limitations of traditional physical measurement methods. Consequently, the proposed model shows high performance (R-squared = ≈0.9987) for predicting both edge heights. Compared to a conventional manual measurement method, the proposed model reduces the measurement time per blade by ≈99%, and the total inspection time by ≈93.61%. Moreover, by utilizing explainable artificial intelligence, key features for prediction are identified, providing insight into why the model is capable of robust and precise measurements even in the presence of noise. The developed vision-based deflection measurement system is expected to contribute significantly to the automation of quality control of axial fans to realize the future smart injection-molding plants. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Modern agriculture faces critical challenges, including climate change induced water shortage, inefficient resource utilization, and reducing soil health which reduce sustainability and reduce crop yields. Traditional farming methods, dependent on manual observation and generalized practices, often lack the precision needed to address these growing issues. To meet these demands, this study presents an artificial intelligence (AI) powered smart agriculture system that integrates deep learning (DL), Internet of Things (IoT), and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to enable intelligent, data-driven farming. This study addresses key challenges such as ineffective soil management, poor irrigation practices, and the absence of personalized crop and fertilizer recommendations. IoT-based sensors provide real-time soil analysis, measuring critical parameters such as nutrient levels, moisture, and temperature. Advanced DL models were employed for various tasks in the AI-Driven Smart Agriculture System. The Transformer-based Tabular Learning (TTL) model for irrigation advice gives an accuracy of 99.13%. For soil analysis, the TabNet regressor achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.51 and an R2 score of 98.7%, while XAI techniques were used to explain and interpret its predictions. The Sparse Weighted Fusion Transformer (SwiFT) model for crop recommendation gives an accuracy of 98.75%. For fertilizer recommendation, the TabNet classifier achieved an accuracy of 99.3%, with XAI techniques applied to explain the reasoning behind its predictions. These results demonstrate that the system delivers precise and actionable insights. A weather Application Programming Interface (API) is integrated to support timely irrigation decisions through accurate forecasting. A chatbot interface is also added which enhances system usability, accessibility and user-friendliness for farmers. The proposed model improves crop productivity, optimizes resource use, and supports adaptation to environmental changes. By leveraging AI and IoT technologies, the proposed model gives a solution which helps in sustainable agriculture, environmental resilience, and global food security, thus benefiting stakeholders ranging from individual farmers to large-scale agricultural business. Future work will explore real-time adaptive control mechanisms and expand model generalization across diverse geographical region. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

These techniques offer significant improvements in disease detection accuracy, leveraging spectral and spatial features to identify subtle symptoms before they are visible to the human eye. A comprehensive analysis of 14 key studies highlights the strengths and limitations of existing methods, the datasets employed, and the performance metrics used to evaluate these models, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC. The review emphasizes the potential of hybrid models to bridge the gap between traditional imaging approaches and emerging demands for scalability, interpretability, and real-time performance in agricultural settings. Additionally, it discusses challenges such as dataset quality, computational complexity, and model generalization, providing insights into how these issues can be addressed through advancements like transfer learning and explainable AI. By synthesizing the findings, this work underscores the transformative role of hyperspectral imaging and deep learning in sustainable crop management and precision agriculture. It concludes with recommendations for future research, focusing on enhancing model robustness, expanding datasets to cover diverse species and diseases, and ensuring real-time applicability for field deployment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study investigated the influence of built environment features on crosswalk safety in dense urban settings, with a focus on visual streetscape characteristics extracted from street-view imagery using both semantic and instance segmentation. It used data from 36,750 crosswalks in Seoul, South Korea, to rigorously evaluate multiple machine learning algorithms for predicting pedestrian crash risk. Among the models assessed, the Random forest (RF) demonstrated the highest precision, aligning with the objective of enhancing pedestrian safety through accurate risk identification. The RF model enhanced by SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) achieved strong predictive performance (precision: 0.91), and SHAP analysis identified visual features, particularly sky openness ratio, building coverage, and sidewalk ratio, as influential factors affecting crash risk. A lower sky openness ratio combined with a higher building ratio was associated with increased crash likelihood, whereas greater sidewalk coverage and the presence of traffic control measures, including traffic lights and crosswalk time indicators, mitigated risk. Interaction effects further highlighted the complexity of urban safety, showing that combinations of streetscape and infrastructural elements can amplify or reduce hazards. These results highlight the importance of combining visual and structural data for thorough risk assessment and further the use of interpretable machine learning in urban safety research. The findings imply that to address particular combinations of built environment elements that increase the risk of crosswalk crashes, policy and planning initiatives should concentrate on context-sensitive interventions, particularly by placing bus stops strategically, maintaining tree canopies for visibility, clearing visual clutter, and improving pedestrian infrastructure. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The study present an interpretable deep-learning framework, optimized using a hybrid Genetic Algorithm-Particle Swarm Optimization (GA-PSO), to predict and enhance the compressive strength of nano-modified geopolymer concrete (GPC). The framework integrates attention-augmented neural networks with SHAP-based explainability, Monte Carlo dropout uncertainty quantification, and surrogate-assisted multi-objective optimisation to simultaneously maximise strength while minimising cost and embodied CO<inf>2</inf> emissions. A curated dataset comprising 234 experimental GPC mixes–incorporating variables such as precursor type, nano-silica dosage, activator content, and curing conditions—was subjected to advanced preprocessing and polynomial feature engineering. A Binary Grey Wolf Optimiser (BGWO) was used for feature selection. The proposed DeepGA-PSO model outperformed conventional regressors (e.g., SVR, Random Forest, XGBoost) with an R2 of 0.994 and RMSE of 3.86 MPa. Explainability analyses identified curing regime, sodium hydroxide, and nano-silica content as key predictors. Optimisation via NSGA-II yielded Pareto-optimal mix designs suitable for cost-effective and low-carbon construction. A MATLAB-based GUI was developed to facilitate real-time mix design and prediction. This study offers a robust, scalable, and interpretable pipeline for data-driven GPC optimisation and provides a methodological foundation for intelligent infrastructure materials engineering. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Technical diagnostics of high-voltage equipment is a relevant task to reduce the risks of accidents at power facilities and, consequently, to ensure reliable power supply to consumers. Currently, a lot of research is aimed at improving the accuracy of diagnostics of high-voltage equipment, in particular, power transformers using machine learning methods. However, the application of machine learning leads to the construction of diagnostic systems that are a "black box"for the user, if the methods of explainable artificial intelligence are applied. This paper proposes the application of Shapley additive explanations algorithm to increase the interpretability of ensemble machine learning models in assessing the technical state of a power transformer using the proposed modified Shapley additive explanations method. An open dataset containing the results of transformer oil sampling was used. The difference of the paper lies in the modification of Shapley additive explanations, aimed at increasing the informativeness of visualization of interpretations of the results of machine learning models. The proposed method makes it possible to increase the validity of decisions made in the technical diagnostics of high-voltage equipment using machine learning models, which will allow for more effective implementation of intelligent decision support systems in the power industry. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Self-Explaining Autonomous Systems (SEAS) have emerged as a strategic frontier within Artificial Intelligence (AI), responding to growing demands for transparency and interpretability in autonomous decision-making. This study presents a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of SEAS research published between 2020 and February 2025, drawing upon 1380 documents indexed in Scopus. The analysis applies co-citation mapping, keyword co-occurrence, and author collaboration networks using VOSviewer, MASHA, and Python to examine scientific production, intellectual structure, and global collaboration patterns. The results indicate a sustained annual growth rate of 41.38%, with an h-index of 57 and an average of 21.97 citations per document. A normalized citation rate was computed to address temporal bias, enabling balanced evaluation across publication cohorts. Thematic analysis reveals four consolidated research fronts: interpretability in machine learning, explainability in deep neural networks, transparency in generative models, and optimization strategies in autonomous control. Author co-citation analysis identifies four distinct research communities, and keyword evolution shows growing interdisciplinary links with medicine, cybersecurity, and industrial automation. The United States leads in scientific output and citation impact at the geographical level, while countries like India and China show high productivity with varied influence. However, international collaboration remains limited at 7.39%, reflecting a fragmented research landscape. As discussed in this study, SEAS research is expanding rapidly yet remains epistemologically dispersed, with uneven integration of ethical and human-centered perspectives. This work offers a structured and data-driven perspective on SEAS development, highlights key contributors and thematic trends, and outlines critical directions for advancing responsible and transparent autonomous systems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - We present a preliminary study of a model-agnostic method called prototype pair decomposition that generates simple and accurate decision rules from datasets. The research focuses on its application to decision trees. It starts by selecting representative prototypes obtained by a prototype construction method, then pairs of prototypes from opposite classes are determined. These pairs define subspaces containing a fragment of the decision boundary in which a shallow decision tree is applied to extract simple decision rules consisting of a few premises. The results indicate that the proposed solution allows the extraction of locally competent simple rules that are comparable in terms of classification accuracy to a large and complex set of global rules obtained from standard decision trees. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Public safety in disaster operations relies heavily on accurate predictions which help minimize flood damages. The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network demonstrates exceptional forecasting abilities in time-series applications thus making it an ideal choice for flood prediction operations. The presented research design implements a data-based flood prediction model which unites LSTM neural networks and collects hydrological information together alongside meteorological and topographical data to enhance forecasting precision. The predictive model uses IoT sensor along with satellite observation data to optimize hyperparameter adjustments which leads to better generalization outcomes. The forecasting performance is validated by three metrics including RMSE, MAE and R2 which ensure dependable results. The model tackles three common limitations such as scarce data and excessive noise and calculation restrictions using transfer learning and regularization capabilities and cloud storage deployment. The experimental results show that LSTM maintains superiority over conventional statistical models and brings an effective scalable flood risk management system. The research investigates both hybrid AI systems and explainable AI approaches for enhancing AI readability and accuracy levels. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper, we improve the ShapG method (a feature importance algorithm based on graphs) to enhance computational efficiency while maintaining acceptable accuracy. The ShapG method is a novel method in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) providing the feature importance in complex machine learning models using the Shapley value calculated for the graph constructed based on data. Our primary contribution focuses on optimizing the graph construction stage. Unlike the original ShapG method which starts from an empty graph, our enhanced approach begins with a complete graph and iteratively removes edges based on measures between features and target variables. Throughout this process, we maintain graph connectivity and ensure the graph density remains above a predefined threshold. This optimization procedure significantly reduces computational complexity. For the Shapley value calculations, we retain the original ShapG sampling approach. Experimental results demonstrate that our improved method achieves substantial gains in computational efficiency in comparison with the original ShapG method and other XAI methods. Additionally, we provide recommendations for selecting appropriate measures for different machine learning tasks. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Migrant laborers in the construction sector often face challenges related to wage disparities, workplace safety violations, and legal non-compliance. EnDL-Migrate represents an Ensembled Transformer-XGBoost Framework which identifies and predicts labor rights violations in Thiruvalluvar District's Construction Industry. EnDL-Migrate uses Transformer-based NLP models to handle labor law analysis and legal case reports in combination with structured socioeconomic data analysis through XGBoost-based predictive analytics. An extensive dataset received training while incorporating three interpretability enhancements through categorical encoding and feature scaling alongside legal policy embeddings. Experimental testing establishes that EnDL-Migrate obtains 97.69% accuracy which exceeds baseline performance levels of Logistic Regression (85.32%) and Random Forest (91.47%) and SVM (89.21%). SHAP analysis determines wage disparities, contract enforcement and workplace safety ratings as the most influential factors which affect labor rights. The developed system offers an advanced AI platform which helps monitor legal compliance and generates recommendations alongside providing support tools for decision-making stakeholders. The explainable AI approach of EnDL-Migrate pushes transformative changes to labor rights protection while supporting data-based developments of legal reforms. Future investigations concentrate on broadening the model across various industries and integrating real-time legal updates as well as refining model generalization by using federated learning methods. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Accurate prediction of phosphorus content in molten steel at the end of the electric arc furnace (EAF) smelting process is crucial for optimizing smelting efficiency and ensuring product quality. Inaccurate predictions can result in increased resource consumption and compromised product quality. This study proposes a novel FA-MM-TabNet model, which integrates Firefly Algorithm (FA) optimization, metallurgical mechanisms (MM), and the deep learning-based TabNet algorithm to predict endpoint phosphorus content in EAF operations. The model was trained and tested on actual production datasets and demonstrated superior performance compared to competing models, achieving a mean absolute error of 0.0024, a root mean square error of 0.0034, and a hit rate of 90.82% within a ±0.005% error margin. Furthermore, an interpretability analysis using explainable artificial intelligence methods, including model-specific and SHAP analyses, confirmed the model’s alignment with metallurgical principles. This enhances the model’s reliability and applicability in industrial settings, contributing to more efficient steelmaking practices. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Water quality management faces escalating global challenges due to pollution, climate change, and population growth. This review critically examines the integration of machine learning (ML) with conventional water quality monitoring and treatment methods, presenting a systematic comparison of their capabilities, limitations, and synergies. While traditional techniques like atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and chromatography provide unmatched precision (e.g., detecting arsenic at 0.1 ppb), they suffer from high costs ($200/sample), latency (24-72 hours), and scalability barriers. ML-driven solutions, including LSTM networks and random forest models, enable real-time anomaly detection (e.g., 85% accurate algal bloom prediction 7 days in advance) and operational optimization (15% cost reduction in wastewater treatment). Hybrid frameworks such as sensor fusion systems (reducing measurement errors by 83%) and digital twins (preventing 60% of public health risks during contamination events) demonstrate transformative potential by bridging these approaches. However, persistent challenges include data scarcity in developing regions (only 12% of Sub-Saharan African monitoring stations provide real-time data), algorithmic bias (65% sensitivity loss in cross-regional models), and regulatory skepticism toward "black-box" systems. Emerging solutions like federated learning (35% accuracy improvement in pan-African E. coli prediction) and explainable AI (SHAP-guided nitrate models) address these barriers. Future directions explore IoT-edge systems (90% accurate TinyML sensors at 50 mW power), quantum-optimized adsorbents (2.5x mercury removal efficiency), and satellite-enabled global monitoring (85% microplastic detection accuracy). The review underscores the necessity of interdisciplinary collaboration to standardize hybrid frameworks, ensure equitable data governance, and translate technological innovations into actionable policies for sustainable water security. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has become an essential force in modern civil engineering, reshaping conventional methods through intelligent data processing, predictive modeling, and automated decision-making. This review presents a comprehensive synthesis of AI applications across eight major civil engineering domains: structural analysis and design, concrete technology, geotechnical engineering, hydraulic and water systems, transportation and pavement engineering, construction management, building information modeling (BIM), and green infrastructure with sustainability assessment. The study systematically analyzes findings from 106 peer-reviewed sources, highlighting how AI models, especially machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and hybrid combinations such as ANN-PSO and CNN-XGBoost, have significantly improved performance in complex, nonlinear, and data-intensive scenarios. The review reveals that AI-based systems have enhanced the precision of strength predictions, classification of soil types, analysis of fluid dynamics, optimization of transport networks, and the integration of BIM environments with real-time data for advanced infrastructure management. In construction, AI supports safety monitoring, resource planning, and risk forecasting, while in sustainability, it aids in carbon footprint modeling and energy efficiency analysis. Moreover, the incorporation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and sensor-based systems with AI has enabled real-time feedback and intelligent decision support in several infrastructure systems. Despite its transformative impact, AI integration in civil engineering still faces limitations. These include data scarcity, model transparency challenges, high computational costs, and lack of standardized benchmarks. To address these issues, the review outlines key research recommendations, including the use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), the adoption of transfer learning for small datasets, explainable AI (XAI) frameworks, and AI-enabled digital twins for infrastructure lifecycle management. This paper serves as a consolidated reference for researchers and professionals aiming to harness AI in the planning, design, operation, and sustainability of civil infrastructure systems. It not only maps the current state of AI in civil engineering but also offers a roadmap for future advancements toward smarter and more resilient infrastructure. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study presents a novel, interpretable machine learning framework for predicting the maximum pull load of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) bonded to concrete substrates. A comprehensive test database comprising 983 datasets was gathered from relevant existing studies. The datasets include key input parameters such as concrete compressive strength, bond length, width of FRP sheet, width of concrete block, FRP thickness, and elastic modulus of FRP sheets, with the maximum pull load as the output parameter. Utilizing this curated database, a symbolic regression model based on genetic programming (GP) was developed to uncover the nonlinear relationships among critical variables including axial stiffness of FRP, bond length, and concrete compressive strength. The model's predictive performance was evaluated using standard regression metrics, achieving mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) values below 5 kN, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) slightly above 10%, and coefficient of determination (R2) exceeding 0.90 on both training and testing datasets. These results confirm the model's accuracy and generalizability. Unlike black-box models, symbolic regression offers an explicit mathematical expression, ensuring transparency and interpretability for engineering applications. To facilitate practical deployment, a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) named MaxPLoad-FRP-Concrete-GPaided-PredictionModel was developed, enabling practitioners to input key design parameters and obtain immediate, interpretable predictions. This tool serves as a valuable decision-support system in the structural design and quality control for FRP-strengthened concrete structures. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Emergency departments (EDs) require effective approaches for quickly identifying patients at risk of critical outcomes (inpatient mortality or ICU admission within 12 hours). This study developed interpretable machine learning models using Gradient Boosting (GB) and Logistic Regression (LR) with 13 initial triage variables from the MIMIC-IV-ED database. GB performed slightly better than LR (Accuracy: 78.21% vs. 77.27%, AUROC: 0.887 vs. 0.863, AUPRC: 0.445 vs. 0.370). The Te2Rules method was used to extract 43 clinically interpretable rules from the GB model, with a overall fidelity of 98.90%. The use of the Rule Coverage Index (RCI) to categorize rules into high, medium, and low levels futher enhanced clinical utility. This study aims to strike a balance between predictive accuracy and interpretability, facilitating clinicians in early detection of critically ill presenting to the ED. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Soil erosion is a dominant geomorphic process and a critical determinant of ecological productivity in mountainous regions. Assessing its rate, spatial pattern, and controlling factors is essential for understanding and managing its impact. This study assesses soil erosion susceptibility in the Lidder watershed of the Greater Himalayas by combining the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) with six machine and deep learning (MDL) models and presents the first application of Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) based Game Theory for erosion modeling in the Himalayan region. The erosion map generated using RUSLE estimated annual soil loss (A) of 58.81 t ha−1 yr−1. It was used to delineate non-erosion zones (A < 1st quartile = 0.74 t ha−1 yr−1) and erosion zones (A > 3rd quartile = 97.20 t ha−1 yr−1) in the watershed. These zones formed inventory datasets for applying the MDL models with twenty-four soil erosion conditioning factors, including topographic, hydroclimatic, lithological, geomorphological, soil physiochemical, and landcover factors. Machine learning models outperformed deep learning-based models in soil erosion susceptibility assessment. Random Forest performed the best, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.96, area under the precision-recall curve of 0.96, and Cohen’s Kappa () index of 0.76. This performance is attributed to its efficiency in learning from limited datasets and its ability to handle heterogeneous data effectively. The results reveal that 7.51%, 5.77%, 9.26%, 16.60%, 40.14%, and 20.72% of the watershed area exhibit negligible, minimal, moderate, high, severe, and extreme erosion potential, respectively. SHAP-based Game Theory revealed that slope, elevation, surface temperature, stream density, and bare ground were the strongest contributors to erosion risk, while vegetation cover, built-up, and agricultural terracing mitigated erosion. The study demonstrates that these anthropogenic activities counter the negative impacts of slope steepness on soil erosion in the mountainous areas. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Vertical farming is revolutionizing agriculture by enabling the cultivation of crops in controlled environments, optimizing space usage, and reducing the need for traditional farming resources. However, the artificial conditions in vertical farms can induce stress in plants, affecting their growth and productivity. This paper presents a novel approach to detecting canopy stress in vertical farming using explainable AI techniques. The proposed method leverages deep learning models, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to analyze images captured by cameras and sensors within the vertical farm. By employing Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping), the model provides visual explanations for its predictions, enhancing transparency and trust in the AI system. The study utilizes the Agricola Moderna Healthy-Stress Dataset (AGMHS), comprising high-resolution RGB images of crops, to train and validate the model. The methodology includes pre-processing steps such as image resizing, noise removal, and contrast enhancement, followed by feature extraction using ResNet50 and dimensionality reduction with PCA. The classification of stress conditions is performed using CNNs, and the results are interpreted using Grad-CAM to highlight the critical regions influencing the model's decisions. The proposed approach demonstrates high accuracy in detecting stress conditions, outperforming existing methods. The integration of explainable AI techniques ensures that stakeholders, including farmers and researchers, can understand and trust the model's predictions, ultimately contributing to more efficient and sustainable vertical farming practices. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - All over the world, the movement for the mid- and high- rise wooden building has been activated to aim for sustainable society. To promote these activities, the dynamic behavior of such buildings should be cralifised and an analysis method for such building should be verified. In this study, we targeted the full-scale shaking table test of 5-story wooden structure and analytical study was conducted. But, it is difficult to conduct analysis accurately and verification is time-consuming. One of verification method of the analysis is parameter identification. At present, the paremeter identification has been applied to detailed analysis model for buildings. This needs a lot of time if the common identification method is used, so we applied the efficient parameter identification method using quality engineering and interpretable machine learning “SHAP”. Adopted method is based on comprehensive parameter search using quality engineering and “SHAP” is useful for efficient parameter search to evaluate parameter influence. The identification results showed good agreement with experiental results. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study evaluates the application of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to identify key image regions for enhancing pulse wave estimation using traditional signal analysis methods. The approach assumes that Grad-CAM masking enables the selection of relevant image areas, improving the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). Experiments were conducted on the PURE dataset using the TS-CAN model and rPPG-Toolbox. Grad-CAM maps identified facial regions most influential for model prediction, allowing the exclusion of areas not contributing to accurate estimation. The study also explored different temporal window sizes and their impact on signal quality. Method evaluation included SNR<inf>raw</inf>, SNR<inf>max</inf>, SNR<inf>sum</inf>, and Hjorth descriptors. Results confirmed that Grad-CAM masking enhances rPPG signal quality, enabling more precise heart rate estimation. Statistical analysis validated the significance of the findings, highlighting the potential of interpretable deep learning methods in signal analysis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Intrusion event detection in distributed fiber optic sensing systems plays a vital role in urban emergency management and public safety. However, current AI-based systems face high false positive and false negative rates, as well as limited generalizability, due to variations in dataset quality, processing methods, and model architectures. To address these issues, we propose the Riemannian-Transformer-OTDR (RTO) model, an explainable deep-learning approach based on Riemannian manifolds. By exploiting the manifold space, our method identifies stable latent representations of dynamic data distributions from similar events, embedding intrusion detection within this latent manifold. The RTO model accurately identifies identical event types across diverse scenarios, reducing misclassification rates and enhancing model stability. Field tests using a distributed fiber optic sensing system validated the effectiveness of RTO: it achieved 98.43% accuracy in a subway construction scenario and demonstrated its cross-scenario generalization ability by maintaining 94.21% accuracy in gas pipeline monitoring, with 80.79% accuracy in a 100% noisy environment. Additionally, signal structure analysis of misclassified samples revealed insights into the model’s learning process. Our analysis of performance degradation across scenarios and noise levels further clarifies the RTO mechanisms and explainability. Ultimately, the RTO enables precise, retraining-free intrusion event classification across multiple scenarios, offering a practical solution for rapid event detection deployment in various domains. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Explainable AI (XAI) increases the transparency of AI, it is a set of techniques that help us how machine learning algorithm make decisions however issues persist, particularly in understanding image generation tasks. Numerical interpretability is the major issue that makes it challenging for models to understand numerical values in prompts to recognize the number of subjects for image generation using diffusion models. In this study, prompt engineering using Generative AI and SHAP-based (Shapley Additive Explanations) explainability are used to enhance the prompt and understand the features that contribute to the generated image. The Gemini API prompts refined model responses and increases numerical interpretability because generative AI can reduce human errors and enhance image features through structured prompts. Prompt engineering techniques are used to guide Artificial Intelligence models to produce desired output, techniques such as dynamic prompting expands the prompt and improve the numerical interpretability and clarity of the actual input.Synthetic images were tested for distortion using Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR: 9.11 dB) and our model is 20% better than the existing model and the Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS: 0.69) for 69% dissimilarity between the generated images of our extensible diffusion model model and the existing stable diffusion model, the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM: 24%) for structural consistency and the Con trastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) Score for semantic alignment between text and image. The results indicated reduced noise, better prompt alignment, and greater transparency. By combining structured prompting, explainability, and quantitative testing, this method improves generative model control, ensuring efficiency, interpretability, and better image quality for real-world applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This review examines how hybrid models, grouped learning, and explain/reason-able AI can enhance the sensing and detection of crop diseases, which is vital for increasing farm productivity and ensuring global food security. A novel approach combining ResNet50 and VGG16 provides high accuracy in detecting diseases in crops such as cashew, tomato, cassava, and maize. By employing grouping techniques with tools like CNN, ResNeXt, and InceptionV3, the system turned out remarkably more effective by combining their individual strengths. To build trust, the research also incorporates explainable AI methods like S.H.A.P and L.I.M.E, which help farmers and experts understand how the AI arrives at its predictions. Incorporating weather data, such as temperature and humidity, further enhances the system's accuracy, as these factors play a vital role in how diseases spread. This approach not only delivers accurate results but also emphasizes the importance of transparency in AI tools. By combining advanced technology with clear explanations, this study showcases how AI can help manage crop diseases sustainably, supporting farmers to ensure a stable food supply for the future. This unique method has the potential to change farming practices, reduce crop losses, and contribute to global food security. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This pilot study explores the feasibility of using text from Electronic Health Record (EHR) at the University Medical Center Utrecht to classify patient eligibility for cardiovascular risk management. The primary goal is to improve the identification of at-risk patients and facilitate timely, personalized interventions. Through a ResNet architecture, which is used as a feature extractor, the outputs are then passed into a neural network classifier to predict patient eligibility for cardiovascular risk management. Despite excluding numerical data from EHR during model training and inference, and the imbalanced nature of the dataset, the model achieved promising results with an accuracy of 85% and an F1-score of 0.85. This preliminary analysis demonstrates the feasibility of the approach and establishes a solid foundation for further improvements. Future research directions include integrating Explainable AI techniques to enhance model transparency, expanding the dataset, and addressing class imbalance through data augmentation or resampling techniques. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Market trend research is essential for taking advantage of the best investing opportunities to maximize profits and the quickest way to minimize losses, because stock forecasting is complex and fraught with dangers and uncertainties. All five of the following stock-market trends - upward, downward, double-top, and rounded-top - can be predicted using our proposed deep learning model. Average accuracy for the suggested model is 94.9 %, which is higher than common benchmarks like logistic-regression (53.41%), random-forest (85.14 %), and support-vector-machine (62.56). In addition, across four real-world heterogeneous datasets, the suggested model outperforms the competition in terms of F1-score, with a performance of 94.85 %. In comparison, RF achieved 77.95 %, SVM 21.02 %, and LR 46.23 %. In order to make the forecasts more understandable to stakeholders, we also use SHAP and LIME, two XAI approaches, to improve interpretability. By identifying the ten most significant characteristics, the SHAP analysis allows for feature reduction without sacrificing performance. This study's findings show promise for real-world use in financial decision-making by helping investors with risk management and long-term planning through a combination of interpretability and predictive power. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Mathematical modeling plays a critical role in modern supply chain management (SCM) by enabling optimization, forecasting, and informed decision-making across complex networks. This review synthesizes recent advancements in mathematical modeling across five key domains of SCM: demand forecasting, inventory control, logistics and distribution, sustainability, and the integration of emerging technologies. We explore a wide array of modeling techniques, including time-series analysis, stochastic models, optimization algorithms, and machine learning, highlighting their applications, strengths, and limitations. Special attention is given to the evolving roles of artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), and digital twins in enhancing model responsiveness and adaptability. Despite these advancements, challenges remain in achieving model transparency, scalability, and seamless integration with real-time technologies such as IoT and digital twins. Future research should focus on developing more interpretable machine learning models, improving data governance, and fostering cross-domain collaboration to enhance decision-making across the supply chain. This review provides a foundational understanding while identifying key gaps and future pathways for innovation in mathematical modeling for supply chain management. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile compared to traditional financial markets. Hence, forecasting its volatility is crucial for risk management. In this paper, we investigate CryptoQuant data (e.g. on-chain analytics, exchange and miner data) and whale-alert tweets, and explore their relationship to Bitcoin’s next-day volatility, with a focus on extreme volatility spikes. We propose a deep learning Synthesizer Transformer model for forecasting volatility.

By integrating advanced technologies such as virtual reality (VR), artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and digital twins, the metaverse introduces transformative opportunities in patient care, medical education, and healthcare operations. These tools foster immersive, personalized, and data-driven environments, significantly improving diagnostic precision, therapeutic strategies, and training methodologies. This paper provides a framework to utilize this potential while navigating key concerns, including systems scale, user customization, and ethical adequacy. In that case, the framework's goal should be eliminating existing limitations and barriers within healthcare systems by utilizing state-of-the-art technologies with real-world applications. The framework involves virtual consultation sites that enable provider-patient interactions, intelligent virtual agents with specific care recommendations, blockchain integration for data integrity, and dynamic VR segments that are functional in delivering healthcare education and training. The study focuses on scenario-based modeling and the use of pilot deployment in various healthcare settings to test for practicability and feasibility. The research also emphasizes that ethical issues and inclusion during the design and implementation of the innovations should also consider society's values regarding the medical field and promote equal access to healthcare. This framework proves a comprehensive blueprint for continuous progress and places the metaverse as one cornerstone in the global healthcare system. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The settlement prediction around foundation pit is crucial for ensuring the safety and stability of urban construction projects. However, existing studies often face challenges such as limited interpretability of machine learning (ML) models and the inability to perform multi-target predictions for complex geotechnical engineering schemes. To address these issues, this paper investigates the application of explainable machine learning (EML) techniques for the settlement prediction around foundation pit, using measured data from the Yongning Hospital project in Huangyan District as a case study. Two predictive schemes, time series prediction and random sampling prediction, were proposed and validated using classical machine learning models, including multilayer perceptron (MLP), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The results indicate that the random sampling prediction scheme, with the RF model as the dominant predictor, achieves high accuracy, with an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.110 (mm) and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.985. Feature importance ranking and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis reveal that critical features, such as the top displacement of the enclosing pile, significantly influence settlement predictions, enhancing the model’s interpretability. Furthermore, optimization of input features and output targets reduced the number of input features by 70%, lowering resource expenditure while maintaining acceptable accuracy. This research advances geotechnical engineering practices by promoting the use of EML to enhance the accuracy, transparency, and efficiency of the settlement prediction around foundation pit. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Employee attrition, where employees leave the company, presents significant challenges for businesses globally, leading to increased costs, talent loss, and operational disruptions. Addressing the root causes of attrition is essential for maintaining organizational stability and productivity. This research focused on addressing the predictive challenge of employee attrition through the development of a novel Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based model. To enhance the model’s interpretability, eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) were integrated. The DNN model achieved an accuracy of 95.71%, with precision, recall, specificity, F1-score, and ROC AUC score all exceeding 0.95. These results demonstrate the model’s effectiveness in identifying employees likely to leave. Furthermore, the insights provided by XAI techniques, both globally and locally, verified well with established human resource management knowledge, offering valuable perspectives on the factors driving employee attrition. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In particle accelerator physics, superconducting magnets are crucial to achieve high-energy particle beams used in fundamental physics experiments. One of the key challenges of superconducting magnets is the transition of the superconducting material to the normal conducting resistive state—called quench—which could cause damage to the superconducting magnet volume, due to the large quantities of heat produced by ohmic losses in the material if the magnet is not properly protected. In this work, we train explainable machine learning models to detect the occurrence of quenches, starting from the harmonic decomposition of the magnetic field produced by the residual superconducting magnetization after a quench event and aiming at explaining the prediction process. A successful solution to this problem is a fundamental ingredient in the construction of a real-time predictive maintenance system. Indeed, interpretability paves the way to the construction of a tailored, efficient, and affordable system that only considers the relevant magnetic field harmonics. We show that quenches can be detected with high accuracy by rather simple models, and we also describe some preliminary but encouraging results on the quench localization problem. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Agents are a special kind of AI-based software in that they interact in complex environments and have increased potential for emergent behaviour. Explaining such behaviour is key to deploying trustworthy AI, but the increasing complexity and opaque nature of many agent implementations makes this hard. In this work, we reuse the Policy Graphs method -which can be used to explain opaque agent behaviour- and enhance it to query it with hypotheses of desirable situations. These hypotheses are used to compute a numerical value to examine agent intentions at any particular moment, as a function of how likely the agent is to bring about a hypothesised desirable situation. We emphasise the relevance of how this approach has full epistemic traceability, and each belief used by the algorithms providing answers is backed by specific facts from its construction process. We show the numeric approach provides a robust and intuitive way to provide telic explainability (explaining current actions from the perspective of bringing about situations), and allows to evaluate the interpretability of behaviour of the agent based on the explanations; and it opens the door to explainability that is useful not only to the human, but to an agent. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The emerging confluence between artificial intelli gence and ecology has generated a new research frontier, which we refer to as habitat intelligence, aiming to unveil species environment relationships through data-driven approaches. This SLR aims to summarise the pass to the current year (2025) of the research on the use of ML and DL models to represent species preferences, habitat suitability and ecological niches. Based on 365 peer-reviewed papers extracted from SCOPUS, Web of Science and OpenAlex, we identify four main areas of innovation which encompass: automated species identification and ecological monitoring; AI-enhanced species distribution models (SDMs); advanced data collection and processing for ecological research; and conservation-oriented decision support systems. Our review shows that AI has the potential for a more precise and scalable approach to biodiversity investigations in the age of integrated remote sensing, acoustics, citizen science, and environmental data. But we also point out pressing challenges such as data paucity, model interpretability and computational limitations. We suggest that future advancements in this branch of the food web could come from interdisciplinary cooperation using explainable AI (xAI) and the construction of bridging hybrid models between prediction and ecological interpretability. In the end, this review offers a conceptual and methodological ‘roadmap’ to other researchers and conservation practitioners who wish to apply AI to the service of global biodiversity aims. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Artificial intelligence methods have gained prestige in enhancing the formulation of lubricant additives. Thus, this study offers a novel, explainable artificial intelligence approach for optimizing the production of diesel engine oil to achieve the nominal production capacity and the most effective combination of additives. Hence, a novel approach consisting of a goal programming model, hybrid machine learning (ML), and meta-heuristic is developed to uphold conformity to the nominal capacity, with constraints that cover acceptable ranges for additives and control limits for quality indicators. Due to the lack of a closed-form representation for the production function and quality metrics, the hybrid ML estimates these variables. In addition, an updated version of the continuous variable neighborhood search (CVNS) algorithm, augmented by a Q-learning algorithm, is proposed to generate diverse new combinations of additives. The outcomes revealed that the proposed methodology increased production volume by 17.96 % and decreased quality-related expenses by 21.03%. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study explores the application of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to the spectral analysis of electromagnetic field (EMF) measurements conducted across various frequency bands in Cyprus. Using an extensive data set obtained from mobile telephony, radio broadcasting, and terrestrial digital television sources, this work aims to capture real-world EMF exposure levels spanning frequencies from 30 MHz to 6 GHz. The frequency bands analyzed include FM radio (87.5-108 MHz), VHF, UHF television, and various mobile telephony zones (700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2600 MHz, and 3600 MHz), representing both traditional and emerging wireless technologies. A comparative evaluation of six machine learning algorithms was conducted: XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forests, k-Nearest Neighbors, Neural Networks and Decision Trees to assess prediction performance across each frequency band. Furthermore, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was employed to elucidate the contribution of spatial and demographic characteristics to the intensity of the EMF. The results show that ensemble tree-based methods, particularly Random Forests and LightGBM, consistently outperformed simpler models in accuracy and interpretability. The integration of SHAP enabled transparent feature attribution, revealing distinctive exposure patterns linked to urban topology, population density, and built environment metrics. This approach enables data-driven EMF exposure mapping, aiding urban infrastructure planning, compliance monitoring, and public health risk evaluation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Kawasaki disease (KD) is a leading cause of acquired coronary vasculitis in children and remains a critical diagnostic challenge among febrile pediatric patients. To support frontline pediatricians with a more objective diagnostic tool, we developed and implemented KDpredictor, a machine learning-based model for KD risk identification. KDpredictor leverages only the routine blood test features, including complete blood count with differential count, C-reactive protein, and alanine aminotransferase. It also takes the lead in using age-calibrated eosinophil, platelet, and hemoglobin results. Trained using the light gradient boosting machine algorithm on clinical data from 1,927 KD cases and 45,274 febrile controls, KDpredictor achieved strong performance metrics (auROC: 95.7%, auPRC: 72.4%, recall: 0.89) on a reserved test set, outperforming previous models by at least 3% in auROC and 39.3% in auPRC. Additional explainable AI analyses revealed that several top predictive features in KDpredictor are consistent with prior clinical findings. We also evaluated KDpredictor on three independent cohorts collected in East Asia (Taiwan and China) during the COVID-19 period. KDpredictor achieves recall values of 90.9%, 83.7%, and 91.7% on KD samples identified in three independent medical centers, respectively, indicating its applicability across independent clinical settings. In summary, KDpredictor demonstrates robust generalizability in KD risk identification across populations by using only standard blood samples independent of clinical symptoms.

AB  - This paper explores the convergence of Agentive Cognitive Construction Grammar (AgCCxG) and neuro-symbolic AI (NSAI) for modeling human cognition and language processing. AgCCxG conceptualizes language as an embodied, predictive, and semiotic system operating through a Markov Blanket, structuring cognition via differentiation, optimization, and predictive control. NSAI integrates neural networks’ pattern recognition with symbolic AI’s reasoning capabilities, mirroring dual-system models of human cognition. I argue that AgCCxG provides a neurobiologically plausible foundation for enhancing NSAI’s predictive modeling, enabling AI to progress from statistical correlation toward meaning-driven computation. By incorporating semiotic agency, embodied inference, and context-aware reasoning, this integration advances explainable AI, scientific discovery, and personalized education. The synergy addresses critical challenges including the hallucination problem, with symbolic reasoning serving as a corrective mechanism for neural outputs. The future of artificial intelligence requires principled integration of predictive processing, semiotic agency, and embodied cognition—principles that have shaped human language and thought for millennia. This represents a significant step toward bridging human and machine intelligence in more theoretically sound and ethically responsible ways. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Efficient wireless resource allocation is crucial for optimizing energy efficiency (EE) and spectral efficiency (SE) in increasingly complex and dynamic communication environments. Traditional optimization methods often lack real-time adaptability, while standard deep learning approaches face challenges with generalization and data requirements. Large language models (LLMs) offer promising reasoning and few-shot learning capabilities. This paper introduces and evaluates a novel hybrid framework integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with an LLM for adaptive wireless resource allocation. The framework utilizes a knowledge base of historical channel conditions and corresponding optimal power allocations. For new scenarios, relevant historical cases are retrieved via similarity matching and used to construct context-rich prompts for a pre-trained LLM. Critically, this RAG-LLM approach is hybridized with a conventional binary power allocation scheme, enhancing robustness and providing a degree of decision verification by selecting the better-performing allocation. The framework's design, including knowledge base construction, prompt engineering, the hybrid decision mechanism, and algorithmic flow, is detailed. Extensive simulations using a two-link interference channel model (over 20,000 channel realizations) demonstrate the framework's effectiveness. The proposed hybrid method achieves an average EE of approximately 9.65 bits/Hz/J (approaching the theoretical optimum of 10.0 bits/Hz/J for the simulated scenario) and an average SE of approximately 8.1 bits/s/Hz. These results significantly surpass those of pure LLM, conventional binary, and random allocation baselines. A comparative computational complexity analysis highlights the framework's potential for real-time application, discussing the crucial trade-off between substantial performance gains and increased inference latency compared to simpler baselines. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The study aims to utilize interpretable machine learning models to predict the risk of myasthenia gravis onset in thymoma patients and investigate the intrinsic correlations and causal relationships between them. A comprehensive retrospective analysis was conducted on 172 thymoma patients diagnosed at two medical centers between 2018 and 2024. The cohort was bifurcated into a training set (n = 134) and test set (n = 38) to develop and validate risk predictive models. Radiomic and deep features were extracted from tumor regions across three CT phases: non-enhanced, arterial, and venous. Through rigorous feature selection employing Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient and LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regularization, 12 optimal imaging features were identified. These were integrated with 11 clinical parameters and one pathological subtype variable to form a multi-dimensional feature matrix. Six machine learning algorithms were subsequently implemented for model construction and comparative analysis. We utilized SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanation) to interpret the model and employed doubly robust learner to perform a potential causal analysis between thymoma and myasthenia gravis (MG). All six models demonstrated satisfactory predictive capabilities, with the support vector machine (SVM) model exhibiting superior performance on the test cohort. It achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.904 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.798–1.000), outperforming other models such as logistic regression, multilayer perceptron (MLP), and others. The model’s predictive result substantiates the strong correlation between thymoma and MG. Additionally, our analysis revealed the existence of a significant causal relationship between them, and high-risk tumors significantly elevated the risk of MG by an average treatment effect (ATE) of 9.2%. This implies that thymoma patients with types B2 and B3 face a considerably high risk of developing MG compared to those with types A, AB, and B1. The model provides a novel and effective tool for evaluating the risk of MG development in patients with thymoma. Furthermore, correlation and causal analysis have unveiled pathways that connect tumor to the risk of MG, with a notably higher incidence of MG observed in high risk pathological subtypes. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of MG and drive a paradigm shift in medical practice from passive treatment to proactive intervention. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence is driving society toward an increasingly algorithmic future, advancing innovation through data-driven predictive analytics. At the core of this transformation lie advanced Machine Learning-based systems, which hold significant societal potential but often remain inaccessible to domain specialists due to their complexity. This reliance on computing experts limits the integration of domain knowledge and raises concerns about transparency and inclusivity. Drawing from research in HCI, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, and Cognitive Load Theory, this work explores how Visual Programming Languages (VPLs) and touch-based interfaces can support novice collaboration in ML-based system design. We evaluate PyFlowML Touch, a touch-enabled extension of the previously developed PyFlowML system, which enhances node layout and introduces interactive feedback mechanisms tailored to co-located novice collaboration. Designed for domain specialists, PyFlowML guides users through the ML process and incorporates Explainable AI techniques to improve understanding of model behavior [81, 82]. In this exploratory study, a multifaceted evaluation combining cognitive walkthrough and heuristic inspection yields promising insights, suggesting that the touch-enabled interface can reduce intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load while promoting schema construction and collective ML understanding through interactive visualizations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

However, the trust in freely deploying them on space vehicles to increase their autonomy is still questionable by the most qualified scientists in the space domain. This paper therefore delves into explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for vision-based crater detection and navigation, to offer clear and comprehensible predictions to facilitate intelligent lunar landings. We incorporate an attention mechanism into the backbone architecture during the network construction phase, delivering an attention-enhanced Darknet53 (XAttDnet) for explainable feature extraction. Further, we replaced the XAttDnet with the backbone of YOLOv3 and developed the XAttDnet-LSTM models for crater detection and pose estimation tasks. Synthetic datasets generated by PANGU software are used to train and evaluate the proposed networks, showing competitive accuracy in detecting craters and estimating relative poses with RGB images-driven descent scenarios. The roles played by the different convolutional layers in concentrating and extracting features for two tasks are suggested by Visualising the attention maps of each trained convolutional layer. A quantitative assessment of the explainability is attempted by employing the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), which further reveals the evolution of the relationship among the feature extraction layers and inputs/outputs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The quality of red wine can be determined based on several physicochemical and sensory properties. Conventional methods of wine evaluation depend heavily on expert tasters, making the whole process subjective and inconsistent. In this paper, we present a web-based wine quality prediction system based on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), a powerful tool which can provide clarity and aquinting in the wine quality prediction extraction. We train several machine learning models, including the Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks, and we evaluate using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R2 Score. We find that XGBoost performs the best in accuracy, and Random Forest has a balance between interpretability and accuracy. To increase interpretability, we use SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) to evaluate the main features impacting wine quality, including alcohol, volatile acidity, and citric acid levels. Unlike traditional black-box AI models, our system explains to winemakers, sommeliers, and consumers why a given wine is rated the way it is. Moreover, we set up the model as a web application for convenient, real-time predictions of wine quality. This research simultaneously intersects AI and the wine industry by providing a data-driven, interpretable approach to assessing wine quality. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The boom of research topics such as AI literacy and explainable AI (XAI) intensified political discussions about the right for meaningful explanations of the logic involved leave no doubt about the necessity of AI education. However, technologies that we find in our every lives often hide architectural aspects to make their benefits accessible for everyone. Additionally, performance seems to trade-off for explainability, leading to a black-box system not understandable for users and sometimes even experts. To address this issue this paper introduces a workshop framework designed to enhance interactions with large language models (LLMs) - in particular ChatGPT. With emphasis on observation, analysis and hands-on interaction, the workshop framework pursues three different goals: (1) as an event for scientific research, (2) as a learning event and (3) as science communication work to integrate the public more closely into research. Pre-post-test data suggests a shift in participants' interaction patterns when using ChatGPT. Participants not only questioned the AI's responses but also reflected on their own understanding, asking follow-up questions or offering suggestions on how to better explain concepts to the AI. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Digital Twins (DTs) are precise copies of actual systems that exist to which people can interact dynamically. Employed mainly in manufacturing, healthcare and smart city sectors, DTs facilitate the improvement of performance and decision-making. This integration raises the risk of cybersecurity threats including loss of data; wrong access; and advanced persistent threats. Since through integrating DT many other infrastructures are attained by the attackers it becomes a very significant agenda to counter them. In this paper, the strategy of using AI and XAI to enhance cybersecurity in DT systems is analyzed. Some of the AI techniques are Anomaly detection, analysis that predicts and Automated response facilities to provide Security precautionary measures. Such methods are improved by XAI through the addition of the process by which the decisions were made and the trust with the parties involved. Mirroring literature review, deficits of existing DT cybersecurity frameworks, analyzed, include overall issues of scalability, insufficient new threat integration, and increased opacity. For such reasons, the current paper offers a detailed cybersecurity framework that adopts both AI and XAI to fill the existing research gaps. The framework has demonstrated the application of improvements in threat detection, downloads response time and system robustness using real life cases. The presented work is intended for those states where it is possible to create safe and secure DT environments, efficient and capable of countering modern cybersecurity threats. They are aimed to cover existing voids in order to create a socially responsible approach to the use of DT in sensitive domains. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Retaining walls are utilized to support the earth and prevent the soil from spreading with natural slope angles where there are differences in the elevation of ground surfaces. As the need for retaining structures increases, the use of retaining walls is increasing. The retaining walls, which increase the stability of levels, are economical and meet existing adverse conditions. A considerable amount of retaining walls is made from steel-reinforced concrete. The construction of reinforced concrete retaining walls can be costly due to its components. For this reason, the optimum cost should be targeted in the design of retaining walls. This study presents an artificial neural network (ANN) model developed to predict the optimum dimensions of a retaining wall using soil properties, material properties, and external loading conditions. The dataset utilized to train the ANN model is generated with the Flower Pollination Algorithm. The target variables in the dataset are the length of the heel (y<inf>1</inf>), length of the toe (y<inf>2</inf>), thickness of the stem (top) (y<inf>3</inf>), thickness of the stem (bottom) (y<inf>4</inf>), foundation base thickness (y<inf>5</inf>) and cost (y<inf>6</inf>) and these are estimated by utilizing an ANN model based on the height of the wall (x<inf>1</inf>), material unit weight (x<inf>2</inf>), wall friction angle (x<inf>3</inf>), surcharge load (x<inf>4</inf>), concrete cost per m3 (x<inf>5</inf>), steel cost per ton (x<inf>6</inf>) and the soil class (x<inf>7</inf>). The model is formulated and trained as a multi-output regression model, as all outputs are numeric and continuous. The training and evaluation of the model results in a high prediction performance (R2 > 0.99). In addition, the impacts of different input features on the model predictions are revealed using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm. The study demonstrates that when trained with a large dataset, ANN models perform very well by predicting the optimal cost with high performance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The integration of AI into safety-critical autonomous systems faces critical challenges due to various probabilistic sources of uncertainty that affect system reliability and safety. In research carried out on the SAFEXPLAIN project, we propose an end-to-end framework that addresses three key sources of uncertainty: domain uncertainty, epistemic uncertainty, and aleatoric uncertainty. In this article we focus on a reference runtime architecture that attempts to map these sources of uncertainty onto supervisory monitoring modules dedicated to each uncertainty source. This is complemented by explainable AI (XAI)-facilitated data and model learning management strategies to minimize systematic errors and ensure that model predictions remain within the safe boundaries. While aleatoric uncertainty is irreducible, we consider techniques to mitigate it, while domain and epistemic uncertainties are reduced through targeted inter-ventions during development and monitored during deployment. The end-to-end framework's holistic design aims to manage residual uncertainties, significantly lowering the risk of hazards and accidents. In the context of this framework, we provide a walkthrough of our mapping of sources of uncertainty onto our reference architecture using a use case dataset (satellite images) and allude to XAI and uncertainty reduction techniques. This serves as a proof of concept of our approach to render AI models safe to use across related autonomous systems based use cases. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Potatoes play an important role as a major agricultural product since the economic system of Bangladesh strongly relies on farming. The presence of plant diseases particularly late blight poses substantial threats to economic stability together with food security and harvest yields. Lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) represent a new approach to automate the detection of diseases appearing on potato leaves. The validation accuracy obtained by this model reaches an average of 98.53%. The model sustains high performance by employing 0.45 million parameters which leads to minimized storage needs equivalent to 1.75 MB and reduced computational expenses. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) together with LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) serve as explainable AI techniques used to enhance model prediction transparency. The proposed model excels beyond VGG-16 and VGG-19 transfer learning standards in all evaluation metrics including precision, recall and F1-score even though its parameter count stands at 32.8× and 44.6× lower. Mobile deployment possibilities of the simplified modelarchitecture allow farmers to receive prompt disease diagnoses along with correct decision-making resources. A web-based platform enables users to analyze potato leaf diseases by uploading images in real-time. The study creates substantial progress in agricultural productivity alongside ensuring food security for Bangladesh. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Rice leaf diseases pose a significant challenge to food security and agricultural productivity. To address this challenge, innovative disease detection methods are required. A deep learning-based method for detecting rice leaf diseases is proposed in this study, utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) enhanced with a self-attention mechanism. The model was evaluated on an augmented dataset consisting of 22,974 images, which were expanded from 3,829 using data augmentation techniques. Disease identification and classification were performed using CNNs, including Self-Attention CNN, customized CNN, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, and ResNet-50. The effectiveness of these models was demonstrated through experimental results, with the Self-Attention CNN achieving an accuracy of 0.9974, the customized CNN achieving 0.9857, InceptionV3 at 0.9665, MobileNetV2 at 0.9458, and ResNet-50 at 0.8847. SHapley Additive explanations (SHAP) were employed to provide pixel-level insights into the model's predictions by integrating deep learning techniques with model interpretability methods. SHAP heatmaps confirmed that the model focused on disease-specific regions, aligning with domain knowledge and enhancing trust in the system. This transparency improves the reliability of the AI-driven disease detection system and supports its applicability in agriculture. The research demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating self-attention mechanisms with explainable AI, offering a scalable, interpretable, and highly accurate solution for rice leaf disease detection. By enabling precise disease identification and timely intervention, the study advances precision agriculture and promotes sustainable crop management. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Local government implicit debt is a key financing tool for local infrastructure, supporting regional investment through various financing platforms. However, the low short-term default risk and high credit ratings of government implicit debt limit effective credit risk identification, distorting risk pricing. This study employs interpretable machine learning models and post-hoc explainability methods to analyze urban investment bonds (UIBs) credit risk in China from 2015 to 2023. Findings reveal that basic bond characteristics (amount, bond rating) and macroeconomic indicators (monetary policy, market sentiment) are the most influential factors, with regional economic conditions and issuer financial status also playing significant roles. To enhance risk assessment, this study combines the best-performing interpretable EBM model, with the most effective traditional Random Forest model, for a comprehensive predictive analysis. This approach improves both interpretability and accuracy, offering policymakers, investors, and regulators a robust data-driven risk management tool. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - -This paper presents an innovative framework for defect diagnosis and quality control in semiconductor manufacturing using neurosymbolic AI. By integrating knowledge graphs, ontologies, and deep neural networks, the approach harmonizes human expertise and machine learning to predict, diagnose, and mitigate defects in real time. Focusing on Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and other expert sources, the research transforms this knowledge into structured physics-aware ontologies and knowledge graphs to enable seamless integration with neural networks. Additionally, novel ensemble neural network architectures are explored to leverage the full potential of physics-aware neurosymbolic techniques. The proposed framework enhances defect prediction and root cause analysis and also paves the way for more interpretable and adaptive AI-driven quality control systems in semiconductor manufacturing. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Random Forest (RF) is an ensemble learning which creates multiple decision trees and combines their outputs for creating models with less over-fitting. In this study, we apply RF to model the remaining service life (RSL) of rural pavements, a critical factor for developing optimal maintenance strategies and ensuring long-lasting infrastructure. We utilize key variables such as asphalt concrete thickness, base thickness, and surface temperature, along with data from Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) measurements. RF demonstrated performance in predicting RSL with consistent accuracy across a variety of conditions. The ensemble nature of RF allows it to effectively manage complex interactions among variables and handle the inherent variability in pavement performance data which makes it well-suited for rural road networks, where environmental and material differences are significant. While some sensitivity to parameter adjustments was noted, the robustness and reliability of RF highlights its potential to be a transformative tool in rural pavement management. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This research introduces an improved AI-Driven Early Warning System for financial institutions to overcome some of the transparency challenges found with conventional AI models. Traditional black-box"systems, in particular, those that employ complex neural networks, provide limited or no ability for users to understand their decision-making processes. This section raises a number of concerns, especially within the financial sector, where regulatory frameworks require decision-making mechanisms to be transparent and interpretable. To address this challenge, XAI techniques such as SHAP and LIME are integrated with the EWS. These will explain the grounds for the choices made by the AI in order for the predictions to be legally tenable, improve decision-making, and facilitate more transparency with the system. The proposed framework was then applied to real-world financial data and demonstrated prominent improvements in accurately detecting early signals of financial risks. It provided precise insights into the factors driving these risks while meeting regulatory standards. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Agriculture plays a significant role in India's fast-growing economy. It makes up a substantial portion of GDP and employs a sizable section. Among the various crops, potato cultivation is one of the most significant practices since it contributes to food security and is a cash crop for most farmers. However, there are number of illnesses that can negatively affect productivity and quality of potato. There have been several advancements made to address these issues through machine learning techniques. This study presents detection of potato plant diseases by image processing of leaves plagued by the various potato diseases. The application of feature extraction methods such as Hough Transform (HT) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) were explored across various color spaces i.e. RGB, YCbCr, HSV and LaB, followed by the implementation of multiple ML classifiers such as Ada Boost (AB), Random Forest (RF), Naïve Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Gradient Boosting (GB) and logistic regression, on the extracted features. The study shows that logistic regression has achieved the highest accuracy of 0.99 in YCbCr color space with 256 bins. To enhance the knowledge about feature contribution, feature importance analysis was done, and it was found that DWT significantly contributed for efficient model performance. This promoted the XAI approach explained here. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The increasing complexity and uncertainty of construction projects have driven a paradigm shift in risk management, with Artificial Intelligence (AI) emerging as a transformative tool. This systematic review examines 87 peer-reviewed studies published between 2014 and 2024, assessing the role of AI technologies—including machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), knowledge-based reasoning (KBR), optimisation algorithms (OAs), and computer vision (CV)—across the construction risk management lifecycle. Using PRISMA guidelines and NVivo-based mixed-method analysis, the review identifies AI’s core functions in risk identification, assessment, response, and monitoring, while uncovering key barriers such as fragmented implementation, limited adaptability, and socio-organisational resistance. ML and CV dominate predictive and visual analysis, while NLP and KBR support compliance and rule-based decision-making; OAs optimise resource trade-offs. Despite increasing research, critical gaps persist, including fragmented AI integration, limited attention to implementation barriers, and underrepresentation of adaptive response and monitoring stages. This paper makes four specific contributions: (1) it offers a functional taxonomy that maps AI methods to distinct risk management tasks and phases; (2) it synthesizes technical, organisational, and ethical challenges hindering real-world AI adoption; (3) it introduces an integrated AI–risk management lifecycle framework that aligns AI capabilities with construction project needs; and (4) it extends classical risk epistemologies by embedding Beck’s, Power’s, and Aven’s perspectives into the discourse on AI governance. These contributions provide a structured foundation for advancing research and guiding practitioners toward responsible, resilient, and explainable AI deployment in high-stakes construction environments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Segmentation of crop fields is essential for enhancing agricultural productivity, monitoring crop health, and promoting sustainable practices. Deep learning models adopted for this task must ensure accurate and reliable predictions to avoid economic losses and environmental impact. The newly proposed Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) offer promising advancements in the performance of neural networks. This paper analyzes the integration of KAN layers into the U-Net architecture (U-KAN) to segment crop fields using Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 satellite images and provides an analysis of the performance and explainability of these networks. U-KAN performs comparable to or better than the full-convolutional U-Net in half of the GFLOPs. Furthermore, gradient-based explanation techniques show that U-KAN predictions are highly plausible and that the network has a very high ability to focus on the boundaries of cultivated areas rather than on the areas themselves. The per-channel relevance analysis also reveals which channels are critical for explaining model behavior and which have little to no impact, thus providing insights into the features the model relies on for the segmentation task. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Automated welding defect detection has emerged as a pivotal aspect of quality assurance in high-stakes industries such as aerospace, oil and gas, and construction. This paper presents a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art Deep Learning (DL) models tailored for welding defect detection, segmentation, and classification, emphasizing technical advancements and persistent challenges. A critical analysis of single-stage and two-stage architectures is conducted to evaluate their ability to address issues like small defect sizes, low image contrast, and diverse defect geometries. The study also highlights the integration of advanced preprocessing techniques, such as noise reduction and contrast enhancement, within DL workflows to improve feature extraction and detection accuracy. Persistent challenges, such as the scarcity of large, labeled datasets, lack of real-time applicability, and limited model interpretability, are explored in depth. To address these gaps, the survey proposes future directions, including the use of self-supervised learning, domain adaptation, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and explainable AI techniques to enhance the robustness, scalability, and transparency of welding defect detection systems. By synthesizing insights from more than a decade of research, this paper provides a detailed roadmap for advancing automated welding inspection technologies, enabling reliable deployment in real-world industrial environments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Modern healthcare is increasingly relying on Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) systems, which continuously collect health data and provide the ability to monitor patients in real-time. RPM systems are extremely susceptible to cyber threats due to their growing reliance on interconnected devices and hence need comprehensive security. AI has emerged as a crucial technology for addressing security issues in RPM systems. The objective of this survey is to understand the impact on the security of RPM systems by integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) with threat intelligence. This survey analyzed 86 research articles from leading databases related to AI models, security of RPM systems, anomaly detection, and architectural solutions, in addition to 24 articles related to existing RPMs. This survey article emphasizes that RPM systems become much more resilient when automated attack mitigation, real-time anomaly detection, and predictive analytics are provided by AI-powered models. To secure the sensitive data in RPM, this survey discusses how AI can be applied to various architectural solutions, including edge computing, cloud integration, blockchain technology, and Federated Learning (FL). Furthermore, the benefits and challenges of deploying AI-driven threat intelligence, cross-platform compatibility, and the need for explainable AI to improve trust in automatically made decisions are presented. Moreover, this review highlights research gaps, including the necessity of comprehensive end-to-end architectures for maintaining security and privacy in RPM systems. It is revealed through this survey that AI-powered threat intelligence enhances RPM security considerably due to its ability of continuous monitoring, adaptive defense mechanisms, and early detection of threats. However, challenges such as the explainability of AI models persist and necessitate continued innovation. The survey paper suggests integrating AI-enhanced threat Detection as a Service (TDaas) that implements FL to transform the existing RPM security system, and ultimately contributes to a secure and reliable threat detection system in healthcare. This review provides a roadmap for future research in the area of AI-driven threat intelligence security for RPM systems and offers insights for developing resilient healthcare infrastructure. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper explores Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) through a sensemaking lens, addressing the complexity in the extant literature and providing a comprehensive understanding of the process of explainability. Through an exhaustive review of relevant research, we develop a novel framework highlighting the dynamic interactions between AI systems and users in the co-construction of explanations. We conducted a thorough analysis and theoretical synthesis of the extant literature. Based on the results, we developed a framework that shows how explainability emerges as a shared process between humans and machines, rather than a one-sided output. The proposed framework offers valuable insights for enhancing human-AI interactions and contributes to the theoretical foundation of XAI. The findings pave the way for future research avenues, with implications for both academic investigation and practical applications in designing more transparent and effective AI systems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Trucks are the main source of emissions from road traffic. Understanding the relationship between truck emissions and their effect factors is of great significance for achieving carbon peak and carbon neutrality goals under the new development philosophy. First, the average daily CO<inf>2</inf> emissions of trucks under different restriction policies are calculated separately by the emission model based on the Beidou trajectory data of trucks. Then, the spatial distribution of the average daily CO<inf>2</inf> emissions is analyzed and its effect factors are determined within the framework of the built environment. Secondly, the effect mechanism of urban built environment on truck emissions is uncovered by constructing an interpretable machine learning model based on LightGBM model and SHAP framework. Finally, taking Xi'an for example, the nonlinear characteristics and threshold effects of urban built environment on truck emissions in this city are explored based on the proposed models. The results show that among the built environmental elements, highway density, expressway density, trunk road density, secondary trunk road density, number of industrial facilities and number logistics facilities have a positive effect on CO<inf>2</inf> emissions of trucks, and the effect of highway density is the most significant. On the contrary, population density and the number of residential facilities show negative effects. In addition, there are threshold effects of built environmental elements on CO<inf>2</inf> emission of urban trucks, and some built environmental elements, such as highway density, have multi-threshold effects. The result of this paper could provide theoretical basis and data support for low-carbon oriented urban planning and renewal. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Urban homelessness is a complex issue rooted in structural inequalities and spatial disparities, significantly affecting urban life and well-being. Existing research often relies on survey-based or linear regression methods, which are limited in scope, coverage, and their ability to capture nonlinear associations. This study addresses these gaps by combining homeless incident reports from New York City’s 311 service with multi-source urban big data and employing a Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) model alongside SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). Through a census tract-level analysis, we examine how socioeconomic, built environment, transportation, and urban landscape factors relate to homelessness incidence. Our findings show that (1) the importance of predictive factors varies across location types, for instance, information, and communication POIs are most predictive in commercial areas, while felony crime and median income dominate in residential zones; (2) socioeconomic and built environment features are consistently more important than transportation and visual landscape indicators; and (3) many factors exhibit nonlinear relationships and threshold effects, such as sharp increases in homelessness beyond a median rent of $1800 or Gini index of 0.53. These findings offer new insights into the spatial distribution and drivers of homelessness and underscore the value of interpretable machine learning in urban analytics. By identifying key environmental thresholds, this study provides evidence-based guidance for spatially targeted urban interventions, such as prioritizing support services in high-risk areas and designing inclusive public spaces that can help mitigate homelessness and promote more sustainable and equitable cities. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: The number of bidders in upcoming tenders has important managerial implications for both construction clients and contractors in their decision-making in the competitive bidding process. However, there is a stagnation of research efforts on predicting the number of bidders with only a handful of studies over the past decades, which mainly focused on statistical distribution of the number of bidders. This study aims to provide a new perspective of predicting the number of bidders using machine learning (ML) algorithms. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted a case study approach with a bidding dataset of public sector construction projects in Singapore. Six ML models were developed, and linear regression was used as a baseline model is assessing the predictive performance of ML models. Findings: The results show that ML models outperform the baseline linear regression model, in which XGBoost is the best performing model of R2 which is two times higher than the linear regression model. In addition, economic-related factors play a vital role in this prediction problem. Research limitations/implications: While the predictive performance of the developed ML models is relatively low, it indicates the challenges and complexities in this prediction problem, even with the use of artificial intelligent techniques. Originality/value: Being a pioneering work, this study sets a foundation for the use of ML models in this prediction problem and offers insights for future modelling attempts towards the development of a decision support system for construction clients and contractors. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - To ensure a safe environment for occupants, evaluating the physical status and service performance of existing buildings is essential. However, large-scale building condition assessment usually relies on the expertise and judgment of inspectors, which can be costly and laborious due to unclear priorities, ambiguous procedures, and ineffective operations. To address these challenges, this study proposes an explainable machine learning-based screening model for the anomalous safety condition among existing buildings, narrowing down the scope of buildings requiring further and detailed inspection and monitoring. Initially, an imbalanced dataset of 18,090 survey reports of existing buildings of safe and unsafe labels is collected. Then, the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) is conducted to balance the dataset. Subsequently, seven machine learning models are trained utilizing 10-fold cross-validation with grid search. Findings reveal that, based on the balanced dataset, the performance of ensemble learning models is significantly better than that of individual machine learning models. Specifically, the XGBoost model achieves the highest performance, with a macro-F1 of 98.49%, G-mean value of 98.49%, and accuracy of 98.49%. The final predictive model (the SMOTE-based XGBoost model) is explained using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Service year, structure, and location are the three most important features influencing building structural safety. This study represents a promising approach for automated screening of the anomalous safety condition among buildings, optimizing resource allocation, and enhancing the effectiveness in decision-making for construction and maintenance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Extrusion-based bioprinting (EBB) is an efficient, simple, and cost-effective bioprinting technique. However, due to the high complexity of biomaterial inks, a trial-and-error approach is typically required for determining the optimal printing parameter configurations. Thus, the quality and reproducibility of printed scaffolds remain a concern. In this study, we integrated flow sensing into the EBB and replaced conventional fixed-value printing parameters by capturing the time-series data of all printing parameters to enhance the monitoring of the printing process. To improve the EBB adaptability, we conducted experiments with three biomaterial inks with distinct properties under various parameter configurations to achieve ink-insensitive linewidth prediction through the construction and assessment of deep learning models. Additionally, two explainable artificial intelligence methods were used to analyze the decision-making process of the deep learning model. This analysis not only enhanced model reliability but also identified key features in printing parameters and time-series data. These results can be used to improve the efficiency and quality of the EBB processes by using various biomaterial inks. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - There are many different types of technology that can improve well-being and quality of life through monitoring, comprehension, and continuous feedback. One such technology is the digital twin. Consequently, employing a digital twin as a type of solution can improve an individual's emotional health and quality of life in a surrounding environment. But it will take some time to develop digital twin systems that can make it easier to create and use digital twins because there are many variables that can affect how a digital twin is designed, including the kind of sensor, complementary technologies, the context of the situation being assessed for the person, and the surrounding environment. In this paper, we describe a real-time hybrid sensor fusion strategy for environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity and brightness with respect to an individual's heart rate monitoring using machine learning models such as random forest, linear regression and ridge regression. Further, Explainable AI-SHAP is utilized to enhance the interpretability of the machine learning models, hence guaranteeing the credibility and understanding of the digital twin's predictions in this study. These methods put the idea of real- time feedback to use by introducing a digital twin for emotions of human into practice. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Automated defect detection in manufacturing is a critical component of modern quality control, ensuring high production efficiency and minimizing defective outputs. This study presents an enhanced VGG16-based convolutional neural network (CNN) model for defect classification and localization, improving upon traditional vision-based inspection methods. The proposed model integrates advanced deep learning techniques, including batch normalization and dropout regularization, to enhance generalization and prevent overfitting. Extensive experiments were conducted on benchmark manufacturing defect datasets, evaluating performance based on accuracy, loss evolution, precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP). The results demonstrate that the enhanced VGG16 model outperforms conventional CNN architectures and the standard VGG16, achieving higher defect classification accuracy and superior feature extraction capabilities. The model successfully detects multiple defect types, including surface irregularities, scratches, and deformations, with improved robustness in complex industrial environments. Additionally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis confirms the model’s high sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing between defective and non-defective components. Despite its strong performance, challenges such as dataset scarcity, computational costs, and model interpretability remain areas for further research. Future directions include the integration of lightweight architectures for real-time deployment, generative adversarial networks (GANs) for data augmentation, and explainable AI techniques for improved transparency. The findings of this study highlight the transformative potential of deep learning in manufacturing defect detection, paving the way for intelligent, automated quality control systems that enhance production efficiency and reliability. The proposed approach contributes to the advancement of Industry 4.0 by enabling scalable, data-driven decision-making in manufacturing processes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study proposes a multivariate time-series classification approach using deep learning to predict stocks likely to be flagged by the Market Surveillance Measure List in the Thai stock market. Formulated as a binary classification problem, the model distinguishes At-Risk and Normal stocks based on two primary datasets: End-of-Day stock prices and Market Surveillance Measure List records, incorporating trading volumes and technical indicators. To address data imbalance, concept drift, and long-term dependencies, the framework integrates feature engineering, cost-sensitive learning, and rolling window training. Experimental results show deep learning models significantly outperform traditional baseline methods in capturing financial risk patterns. The study identifies models that effectively balance predictive accuracy with computational efficiency, with performance varying based on forecasting horizons. Despite improvements from specialized techniques, the study identifies challenges in long-term financial risk prediction. These findings support market surveillance, algorithmic trading, and portfolio risk management, with future work exploring explainable AI, adaptive learning, and alternative data sources to enhance interpretability and long-term forecasting. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The accurate characterization of signal propagation is critical for optimizing wireless network performance and supporting applications such as electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure assessment and the development of Radio Environmental Maps (REMs). This study proposes a novel, explainable machine learning system to predict electric field strength across diverse urban, semi urban, and rural environments in Cyprus. The system is trained on a rich dataset comprising 6,543 EMF measurements collected in 2023 at mobile phone and digital TV stations, following CEPT/ECC/REC/(02)04 recommendations. The dataset includes geospatial and environmental features such as antenna distance, population density, urbanization level, and detailed built environment characteristics (e.g., volume, surface, and height). We evaluate multiple machine learning models—kNN, neural networks, decision trees, random forests, XGBoost, and LightGBM—using a two-semester split for training and assessment. Best performance was achieved with the Random Forest model, which yielded the lowest RMSE among all models. Gradient boosting models (XGBoost and LightGBM) also performed well, with RMSE values slightly higher than RF while offering flexible and scalable configurations. In contrast, k-NN and neural networks showed higher RMSE values, indicating they were less effective for this specific task. Across all models, confidence intervals were narrow, demonstrating stable and reliable predictions. Explainable AI techniques revealed that antenna distance, building volume, and population density are the most influential predictors of EMF intensity. Our approach outperforms traditional signal models by incorporating urban morphology and demographic context. As part of this system, we also create a Geographic Information System (GIS) that displays electromagnetic field strength maps derived from our explainable machine learning models. This contributes a scalable, interpretable framework for EMF exposure mapping to support regulatory monitoring, urban planning, and smart city initiatives. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study aims to provide an overall view of the current status of AI publications in the entire field of oncology, encompassing productivity, emerging trends, and researchers’ sentiments. A total of 1,296 papers published between January 2019 and January 2024, were selected using the PRISMA framework. Citespace software and the R package “Biblioshiny” were utilized for bibliographic analysis. China has been the leading contributor to global production with over 2,596 publications, followed by Europe. Among 8339 authors, Kather JN was the third most prolific author and held a central position in the co-authorship network. The most prominent article emphasized the Explainability of AI methods (XAI) with a profound discussion of their potential implications and privacy in data fusion contexts. Current trends involve the utilization of supervised learning methods such as CNN, Bayesian networks, and extreme learning machines for various cancers, particularly breast, lung, brain, and skin cancer. Late image-omics fusion was the focus of various studies during 2023. Recent advancements include the use of "conductive hydrogels" and "carbon nanotubes" for flexible electronic sensors. Ninety and a half percent of the researchers viewed these advancements positively. To our knowledge, this study is the first in the field to utilize merged databases from WoS, Scopus, and PubMed. Supervised ML methods, Multimodal DL, chatbots, and intelligent wearable devices have garnered significant interest from the scientific community. However, issues related to data-sharing and the generalizability of AI algorithms are still prevalent. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The recent advancements in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have significantly expanded opportunities across various fields. While ML is a powerful tool applicable to numerous disciplines, its direct implementation in civil engineering poses challenges. ML models often fail to perform reliably in real-world scenarios due to lack of transparency and explainability during the decision-making process of the algorithm. To address this, physics-based ML models integrate data obtained through a finite element procedure based on the lower bound theorem of limit analysis, ensuring compliance with physical laws described by general nonlinear equations. These models are designed to handle supervised learning tasks while mitigating the effects of data shift. Widely recognized for their applications in disciplines such as fluid dynamics, quantum mechanics, computational resources, and data storage, physics-based ML is increasingly being explored in civil engineering. In this work, a novel methodology that combines machine learning and computational mechanics to evaluate the seismic vulnerability of existing buildings is proposed. Interesting and affordable results are reported in the paper concerning the predictability of limit load of structure through ML approaches. The aim is to provide a practical tool for professionals, enabling efficient maintenance of the built environment and facilitating the organization of interventions in response to natural disasters such as earthquakes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Early detection of fig leaf diseases is crucial for maintaining the health and productivity of fig trees. Traditional diagnostic methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and dependent on expert knowledge, highlighting the need for efficient and accurate solutions. This paper proposes a novel hybrid framework, called the MIX model, which combines feature fusion from three pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures—MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, and Xception—with machine learning classifiers to classify fig leaves as healthy or infected. Using a dataset of 2,321 high-resolution images captured under diverse environmental conditions, the model employs advanced data augmentation techniques and transfer learning to address challenges of data scarcity and variability. The feature fusion process leverages the strengths of the CNNs, while classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) enhance prediction accuracy, achieving a maximum accuracy of 93.51%. The incorporation of Grad-CAM provides interpretability by visualizing the key regions influencing the model's decisions. Experimental results demonstrate that the MIX model outperforms individual CNNs, showcasing its robustness and reliability. This framework offers a scalable, transparent, and effective solution for early fig leaf disease detection, contributing significantly to precision agriculture and plant health monitoring. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Uncertainty quantification is a vital aspect of explainable artificial intelligence that fosters clinician trust in medical applications and facilitates timely interventions, leading to safer and more reliable outcomes. Although deep learning models have reached clinically acceptable accuracy in anatomical landmark detection, their predictions remain susceptible to contextual noise due to the small size of the target structures, making uncertainty quantification more challenging than in classification and segmentation tasks. This paper presents an end-to-end uncertainty quantification method tailored for heatmap-based anatomical landmark detection models, designed to improve both interpretability and controllability in clinical applications. Leveraging Dempster-Shafer Theory and Subjective Logic Theory, we implement probability assignment and uncertainty quantification through a single forward pass to ensure computational efficiency. We introduce an evidence map that captures the strength of landmark evidence, alongside an uncertainty map that calibrates predicted probabilities within the Subjective Logic framework. The interaction between these two components, facilitated by a cross-attention mechanism, further improves landmark detection accuracy and enhances the effectiveness of uncertainty quantification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method maintains detection accuracy, even in noisy environments, while outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of uncertainty quantification and quality control. Furthermore, the model effectively identifies out-of-distribution data solely through calibrated probabilities when encountering inconsistencies in multi-center data and novel data, underscoring its potential for clinical applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - It is crucial for correctly recognizing plant diseases for improving agricultural productivity and managing food resources optimally. This work evaluates the effectiveness of various loss functions in transfer learning (TL) for plant disease detection using the PlantVillage dataset, which includes 38 plant classes and is known for its diversity. We assess the performance of several deep learning (DL) models, including VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, DenseNet121, AlexNet, SqueezeNet, MobileNetV2, and GoogleNet. Each model is trained with five different loss functions: cross-entropy, dice loss, focal loss, IoU loss, and label smoothing cross-entropy. Additionally, we utilized the gradient-weighted class activation mapping++ (Grad-CAM++), an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) strategy, to upgrade the clarity and confidence on the results by providing insights into model decisions for single-image predictions. Our experiments show that label smoothing cross-entropy and cross-entropy loss functions show the best performances for the trained models. This study underscores the robustness of TL for the diagnosis of plant diseases, highlighting the implications of the appropriate selection of loss function and the benefits of XAI for diagnostic effectiveness. Our findings offer valuable information for the deployment of DL solutions for an enhanced and accurate monitoring of plant disease in agricultural settings, with greater transparency in model decisions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The implementation of adaptive optimization in multi-product process manufacturing is a crucial strategy for the reduction of unplanned downtime and the enhancement of overall productivity. Nevertheless, the availability of real-time decision support tools for dynamic adjustments in large-scale industries is currently limited. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel model that processes data collected from extensive manufacturing operations. By leveraging Explainable Artificial Intelligence, we developed a real-time decision support system designed to dynamically adjust process parameters following varying input variables. The proposed model achieved a capture rate of 62% of the minority of products that cause micro-stoppages due to non-compliance with specifications. This approach provides a robust framework for adaptive optimization in complex and large-scale manufacturing environments, enhancing productivity and resilience against unplanned disruptions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Workers in the steel manufacturing plants often confront perilous working conditions characterized by limited visibility, potential hazards from heavy machinery interacting with pedestrian staff, and the dangerous dynamicity of manufacturing processes. Such environments involve repetitive tasks, extreme temperatures, high noise levels, and challenging surroundings, fostering situational and behavioral risks that escalate the likelihood of accidents leading to injuries, illnesses, or fatalities. Therefore, it is imperative to scrutinize safety incidents within the steel industries to mitigate risks and enhance safety measures proactively. This study employs Machine Learning (ML) to develop predictive models using a dataset comprising 3600 workplace incidents reported from year 2018 to 2022 from three integrated steel manufacturing plants in India. The aim is to identify conditions indicative of unsafe events or situations based on different ML models. Five ML models were compared viz. Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbor. Random Forest emerged as the most effective, achieving 86.52% accuracy and 100% AUC score in three-class classification. The classification of accident types provides valuable insights into potential risks, enabling proactive measures to prevent future incidents. Through the appropriate identification of conditions that lead to specific types of accidents, this research offers a data-driven approach to enhance workplace safety protocols. Furthermore, this study contributes significantly to Explainable AI (XAI), such as Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), particularly in enhancing workplace safety approaches in the Indian steel industry. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) makes human-machine interactions more transparent and understandable. Given its access to vast amounts of private policyholder data and its critical role in promoting innovation and societal growth, the insurance sector has a great opportunity to demonstrate the capabilities of XAI. The present state of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in insurance practices and research is examined in this article, with an emphasis on their explainability. Through a thorough analysis of 419 primary research papers from 2000 to 2021 from a variety of scholarly sources, the study finds 103 publications that provide an overview of the state of XAI in insurance literature. Using an analysis and classification of these papers, it highlights the use of XAI approaches in critical insurance operations such as claims management, underwriting, and actuarial pricing, among others. In the insurance industry, the study highlights information distillation and rule extraction as the main XAI methodologies. It also promotes the development of interpretable XAI models. By breaking down complex structures into simpler, rule-based ones, this method makes it easier to design models that are easier to understand. By incorporating moral values, openness, and confidence into system design, XAI is a substantial breakthrough in AI. Stakeholders including industry practitioners, regulators, and XAI developers can gain important insights by evaluating these emphasis points within the insurance sector and determining whether regions are ready for more development. By analyzing its applications in the insurance industry, this study provides a fresh viewpoint in addition to enhancing the multidisciplinary understanding of applied XAI. Furthermore, by offering a more nuanced definition based on a thorough analysis of XAI literature within the insurance sector, it adds to the continuing conversations about a precise definition of XAI. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has been used more and more in financial decision-making recently, raising questions about the accountability and transparency of these complex systems. The current study investigates the way Explained Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods might alleviate these concerns and improve the openness of financial decision-making procedures. Nowadays machine learning algorithms are easier to use than ever before, but creating and deploying systems that facilitate real-world banking services has proved challenging. This is mostly due to the fact that algorithms for machine learning are neither transparent or explainable, two attributes that are essential to creating reliable technology. What sets this study unique is the construction of an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) model that addresses these accessibility concerns while also serving as an instrument for the establishment of credit risk control policies. This work proposes an explainable artificial intelligence model for financing risk control to measure the risks associated with credit financing via peer-to-peer financing networks. The framework uses Shapley parameters to provide AI forecasts according to significant factors that explain. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) and gradient boosting methods had the greatest accuracy scores, 92.4 and 97.6, accordingly. The accuracy of the model was evaluated on a bigger database, and the findings demonstrated that it regularly achieved high levels of accuracy. The SVM and GBM models achieved accuracies of 94.8 and 97.6, respectively. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A major health concern are brain tumours; successful treatment depends on early, precise diagnosis. Radiologists are mostly relied upon in conventional diagnostic techniques, which could be time-consuming and prone to subjective interpretation. With Explainable AI (XAI) approaches, especially Grad-CAM, this study suggests a hybrid model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to increase the accuracy and interpretability of brain tumour identification from MRI images. Leveraging their respective strengths in processing complicated data and differentiating high-dimensional classes, the strategy uses CNNs for feature extraction and SVMs for classification. By emphasising the most relevant portions of the MRI scans that support the predictions of the model, the GradCAM approach increases transparency and hence builds clinician confidence in AI-driven diagnoses. The model was trained on a balanced dataset of MRI images, enhanced to enhance generalisation, preprocessed for homogeneity. Whereas the SVM classifier exhibited great classification accuracy across four tumour types - glioma, pituitary tumour, meningioma, and medulloblastoma - the CNN design effectively captured hierarchical patterns in the data. The corresponding F1 scores of more than 90% indicated that the model achieved an overall accuracy of 95% across all tumour types and particularly high performances for meningioma and glioma classification. This multiclass technique offers a possibility of a powerful method to improve the diagnostics of brain tumours by achieving both high performance and interpretability of the results, which is the basis for improved collaboration between the artificial intelligence systems and medical practitioners. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Deep Learning (DL) based artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming pervasive in almost all the day to day applications. These DL algorithms require large amounts of data, which can be easily collected nowadays by deploying sensors in the environment of the system under observation. These DL algorithms however, suffer from drawbacks such as being criticised as 'black-boxes', being biased to generating predictions based on past data and ignoring the human expertise. Hence, an architecture of Enhanced eXplainable Digital Twins (EXDTs) was proposed. EXDTs remove 'black-boxness' of DL algorithms by using the XAI approaches. Further, the digital twins (DTs) underlying the EXDTs are constructed through the sensor data and depict the real-time simulatability. Also, to improve the explainability and use the human expertise/experience, EXDTs use the domain experts' qualitative data. EXDTs are a class of Hybrid AI systems, that use the numeric data for underlying DL algorithms and subjective knowledge of the domain expert. This multimodal data in EXDTs opens up new attacks fronts for data manipulation and change the EXDTs' outputs. In this manuscript, we discuss about the data protection in EXDTs, by simulating various types of attacks and suggesting possible ways the system can counter them. We feel our proposed framework is useful for the involved stakeholders in various domains like precision agriculture, healthcare, manufacturing, etc. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Explanations of deep learning fault diagnosis models have been crucial for risk management and subsequent maintenance actions. Furthermore, purely data-driven approaches for fault diagnosis in industrial processes, without integrating process knowledge or guidance, are limited in generalization ability. This article proposes a graph-based self-explanatory fault diagnosis model. The model employs a graph attention mechanism on a constructed graph data representation of the industrial process, facilitating to capture the causal relationships between process variables. Once the model is fully trained, variations in attention coefficients from normal operating condition are used to identify the root cause of the faulty scenario. This self-explanatory methodology elucidates the model's actual reasoning, obviating the need for additional separate explainable AI methods. Validations through benchmark processes demonstrate significant improvement in fault classification accuracy. Furthermore, variations in attention coefficients effectively identified precise origins of various fault types, including faults that had not been encountered during model training phase. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming industries, generating both enthusiasm and concern. While AI-driven innovations enhance productivity, healthcare, and education, significant ethical issues persist, including misinformation, algorithmic bias, and job displacement. This study examines public perceptions of AI by analyzing large-scale social media discourse and integrating sentiment analysis with expert insights via the Delphi method to assess global perspectives. Findings reveal notable differences across socio-economic contexts. In high-income countries, discussions emphasize AI ethics, governance, and automation risks, whereas in low-income regions, economic challenges and accessibility barriers dominate concerns. Public trust in AI is significantly influenced by governance frameworks, transparency in algorithmic decision-making, and regulatory oversight. Recent advancements in AI governance highlight the increasing role of explainable AI (XAI) and algorithmic fairness, alongside regulatory developments tailored to societal needs. Algorithmic nudging has emerged as a tool for guiding user behavior while maintaining autonomy, and research on user sensemaking in fairness and transparency underscores the importance of interpretability tools in fostering trust and acceptance of AI-driven decisions. These insights emphasize the need for adaptive, context-specific policies that ensure ethical AI deployment while mitigating risks. By bridging public sentiment analysis with governance research, this study provides a comprehensive understanding of AI’s societal impact. Findings offer practical implications for policymakers, industry leaders, and researchers, contributing to the development of inclusive, transparent, and accountable AI governance frameworks that align with public expectations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Effective risk management and compliance adherence are paramount for the success of financial institutions and organizations. However, they often face significant challenges due to fraudulent activities, with ATM fraud, among others, emerging as a prevalent issue in today's banking landscape. We proposed a novel profiling-based one-class classification (OCC) method to solve this problem. Then training phase of our approach employs the K-Means clustering algorithm to cluster non-fraudulent transactions exhibiting similar characteristics and patterns. A rule is generated from each cluster, thereby in a rule set comprising K rules, each consisting of conditions based on the lower and upper bounds on all features. This rule set is employed to identify fraudulent transactions presented in the test phase because ours is an OCC method. One distinctive feature of our approach is its interpretability and explainability, which is crucial for understanding the model's predictions. Overall, our proposed approach demonstrates the best performance vis-à-vis that of various state-of-the-art OCC methods in terms of classification rate. Additionally, we provide sensitivity analysis by varying the number of conditions violated across the K rules. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - New challenges are still there in the credit risk management in this context of the financial system, primarily because of the lack of good models for prognosis as well as low interpretability. To address this issue, this research brings together CatBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM to improve the prospect of identifying high-risk borrowers. A minimal level of Explainable AI (XAI) is utilized to make confirmations that the model follows them and to build confidence in the outcome. Moreover, based on a difference to basic models, the obtained ROC-AUC score equals 0.9693, proving the feasibility of the proposed ensemble approach in questions of impact developing default risks. The end product is therefore a robust method with ensemble modeling and compliant with regulatory requirements in operational financial environments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Digital Twin (DT) technology has emerged as a cornerstone in modern engineering, enabling real-time digital replication of physical assets for monitoring, diagnostics, and optimization. However, as DTs become increasingly integrated into critical infrastructure, their security has become a paramount concern. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on the integration of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) into Digital Twin security, highlighting the potential of XAI in enhancing the transparency, interpretability, and trustworthiness of AI - driven security mechanisms in DTs. We explore various XAI techniques, including model- agnostic approaches, interpretable neural networks, and rule-based systems, detailing their potential applications in bolstering the security of Digital Twins. Furthermore, we identify several key challenges in implementing XAI for DT security, such as the need for standardized metrics for interpretability, the trade-offs between model complexity and explainability, and the potential for adversarial attacks on explainable models. Through our analysis, we highlight the critical research gaps, including the security of Digital Twin (DT) systems and explores the integration of Explainable AI (XAI) to enhance transparency, interpretability, and trustworthiness. Outcomes include detailed XAI applications for DT security, identification of limitations, and a roadmap for future research. We discuss various XAI techniques, their applications, and the current challenges in implementing XAI for DT security. Our survey identifies key research gaps and offers a roadmap for future research in this emerging field. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized and transformed the landscape of software development and testing by introducing new efficiencies and capabilities through advancements like Generative AI (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs). While these technologies bring major benefits in terms of productivity, personalization, and innovation, they also raise critical ethical challenges, such as biases, lack of transparency, data privacy concerns, and potential negative societal impacts. This paper examines the ethical considerations involved in developing such advanced AI systems as well using AI systems within software development and testing. It explores existing ethical frameworks and principles provided by leading organizations, emphasizing core concepts like human-centered design, accountability, transparency, fairness, and privacy. Practical strategies for integrating ethical practices throughout the AI development lifecycle are discussed, with a strong emphasis on the need for continuous ethical evaluation. The paper explores the ethical landscape of AI in software development, addressing challenges like algorithmic bias, data security, and broader societal impacts. Real-world case studies presented in the paper demonstrate the consequences of neglecting ethical considerations. Looking forward, the paper suggests future directions, including the development of unified ethical standards, collaborative ethical auditing, regulatory advancements, and higher societal engagement. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

HEPPs face increasing vulnerability to cyber threats, which can disrupt operations and compromise energy production. This study investigates the integration of Digital Twin (DT) technology with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to improve cybersecurity and anomaly detection in a HEPP located in Türkiye. The DT model simulates key operational parameters, such as water flow, mechanical power, and turbine speed, enabling real-time monitoring, optimization, and secure cybersecurity testing. Simulated cyberattacks on the DT have revealed vulnerabilities in the Modbus protocol, while SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis, an XAI technique, clarifies the influence of operational parameters on anomaly detection outcomes. Gravity with a SHAP value of 0.0001 and water density with a SHAP value of 0.0018 have been identified as the least influential parameters, suggesting limited variability or impact on the detected anomalies. These findings enable the prioritization of critical variables while reducing unnecessary monitoring efforts. The proposed integration improves the accuracy of anomaly detection, enables precise vulnerability identification, and mitigates operational risks without impacting real-world systems. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in detecting anomalies and strengthening the resilience of the system against cyber threats. This approach also provides actionable insights to optimize operational processes, ensuring secure and efficient energy production. The study highlights the transformative potential of DT-XAI integration in advancing the sustainability, security, and resilience of critical energy infrastructures. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Bean rust and angular leaf spot pose significant challenges to bean cultivation, impacting yields. Prompt disease identification maximizes productivity, but traditional methods need specialized expertise. This research presents an explainable deep learning model that combines the Pyramid Vision Transformer (PVT) and Group Context Aware Depthwise Shuffle Network (GCADSN). The PVT effectively models long-range dependencies, identifying disease patterns across larger leaf areas, while the GCADSN focuses on capturing nuanced, context-specific features. This combined approach leads to a richer representation of the input image, resulting in improved disease classification. Model explainability is provided through GradCAM visualizations, highlighting the image regions crucial for the model's predictions and enabling transparent, class-specific insights. The model's performance was rigorously tested using the IBean dataset, a collection of images depicting various bean leaf diseases, including common rust, angular leaf spot, and healthy leaves. Our proposed network achieved a high accuracy of 97.66%, outperforming many current state-of-the-art deep learning models. Furthermore, it demonstrated strong performance across other key metrics, with an F1 score of 97.67%, precision of 97.83%, and recall of 97.67%. Importantly, the model's computational efficiency makes it well-suited for practical application in real-world agricultural scenarios. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This research examines how to improve financial card default risk prediction by using Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, particularly the Locally Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) framework. This work uses LIME to shed light on the decision-making process of the machine learning models employed in credit card default prediction, in response to the growing demand for clear and understandable models in financial decision-making. This method uses a variety of classification methods, such as random forests (RF), support vector machines (SVM), and logistic regression (LR), to forecast default probabilities from a credit card dataset that is made publicly available. Performance measures, including Fl-score, recall, accuracy, and precision, are assessed to determine how effective the model is. Following that, LIME is utilized to describe both the global behavior of the models as well as individual forecasts. Key characteristics' impact on the predictions is demonstrated through visualizations such as force and prominence graphs. In addition to enhancing model interpretability, this study shows that integrating LIME guarantees an openness of economic danger assessments and gives stakeholders useful information about the significance of features. The findings show that debt management risk models that strike a balance between explain ability and model accuracy are more trustworthy and accountable, which helps users make better decisions in high -stakes banking applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Loan eligibility prediction is critical in the financial sector, directly influencing credit access and risk management. This study proposes a cost-sensitive stacking ensemble model that integrates fairness-aware preprocessing, explainable AI techniques, and a custom loss function to address key challenges in loan prediction. The model combines Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost as base learners with Ridge Regression as the meta-classifier, optimizing predictive accuracy, fairness, and interpretability. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms baseline methods, achieving higher accuracy (84.55%), F1-Score (90.85%), and lower log loss (0.3821). SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) provide feature-level insights, enhancing transparency and regulatory compliance. Additionally, fairness-aware preprocessing mitigates biases, promoting equitable credit access. The study contributes a practical, interpretable, and ethical solution for automating loan decisions, and addressing financial and societal objectives. Future work includes exploring dynamic data integration, broader fairness metrics, and scalability optimization. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Industrial maintenance is crucial for companies due to its significant impact on operational costs and efficiency. Many industrial firms find that a substantial portion of their expenses stems from equipment breakdowns, failures, or suboptimal performance over time. These costs can sometimes account for up to 50% of overall expenditures. Additionally, companies face various losses, including downtime from breakdowns, challenges in inventory and purchase management, and potential risks of injuries. The objective of this writing is to investigate how Predive maintenance is a footstep towards industry 5.0 where automation of predictive maintenance is evolved to autonomy in maintenance. In addition to it various machine learning algorithms are suggested to identify between healthy and poor data of a machine which is first step in Predictive maintenance then Deep learning algorithms to construct XAI (Explainable artificial Intelligence). Predictive maintenance, production scheduling, problem detection, predictive quality, and increased energy efficiency are highlighted in the typical use cases of the selected AI applications. Data from the real environment is transmitted to be virtually recreated. Efficient industrial maintenance helps mitigate these costs by reducing downtime, improving equipment reliability, and lowering the need for emergency repairs. By implementing a well-designed and optimized maintenance strategy, production plants can ensure their equipment operates as reliably as possible, minimizing disruptions and enhancing overall operational efficiency. Machine Learning (ML) methods have been appeared as a crucial tool in Predictive Maintenance (PdM) applications to prevent failures in equipment that make up the production lines. However, the performance of PdM applications depends on the appropriate choice of the ML method. To save expenses, find inefficiencies, duplicate tool tracking systems, and do other tasks, Digital Twin evaluates material utilization. Manufacturers create a digital duplicate of any product or system, set of tools and equipment, proprietary goods or processes, or anything else. Their goal is to make the factory floor better. sensors and additional devices that gather real-time. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Deep Learning (DL) models, widely used in several domains, are often applied for posture recognition. This work researches five DL architectures for posture recognition: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Transformer, hybrid CNN-LSTM, and hybrid CNN-Transformer. Agriculture and construction working postures were addressed as use cases, by acquiring an inertial dataset during the simulation of their typical tasks in circuits. Since model performance greatly depends on the choice of the hyperparameters, a grid search was conducted to find the optimal hyperparameters. An extensive analysis of the hyperparameter combinations’ effects is presented, identifying some general tendencies. Moreover, to unveil the black-box DL models, we applied the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) explainability method on CNN's outputs to better understand the model's decision-making, in terms of the most important sensors and time steps for each window output. Innovative hybrid architectures combining CNN and LSTM or Transformer encoder were implemented, by using the convolution feature maps as LSTM's or Transformer's inputs and fusing both subnetworks’ outputs with weights learned during the training. All architectures successfully recognized the eight posture classes, with the best model of each architecture exceeding 91.5% F1-score in the test. A top F1-score of 94.33%, with an inference time of just 0.29 ms (in a regular laptop), was achieved by a hybrid CNN-Transformer. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper addresses understanding and categorizing language by using Markov categories to establish a mathematical framework for semantic concepts. This framework enables us to measure the semantic similarity between linguistic expressions within a given text. Furthermore, this approach enables the measurement and control of uncertainty in language categorization and the creation of metrics for evaluating semantic similarity. We provide use cases to demonstrate how the proposed methods can be applied and computed, focusing on their interpretability and the universality of categorical constructions. This work contributes to the field by offering a novel perspective on semantic similarity and uncertainty metrics in language processing, generating criteria to automate their computation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The Eurasian grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) is one of the most extensively cultivated horticultural crop worldwide, with significant economic relevance, particularly in wine production. Accurate grapevine variety identification is essential for ensuring product authenticity, quality control, and regulatory compliance. Traditional identification methods have inherent limitations limitations; ampelography is subjective and dependent on skilled experts, while molecular analysis is costly and time-consuming. To address these challenges, recent research has focused on applying deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) techniques for grapevine variety identification. This study systematically analyses 37 recent studies that employed DL and ML models for this purpose. The objective is to provide a detailed analysis of classification pipelines, highlighting the strengths and limitations of each approach. Most studies use DL models trained on leaf images captured in controlled environments at distances of up to 1.2 m. However, these studies often fail to address practical challenges, such as the inclusion of a broader range of grapevine varieties, using data directly acquired in the vineyards, and the evaluation of models under adverse conditions. This review also suggests potential directions for advancing research in this field. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

This study conducts a systematic literature review to identify and analyze how AI and smart technologies enhance safety management across various sectors within the Safety 4.0 paradigm. Focusing on peer-reviewed journal articles that explicitly mention “Smart”, “AI”, or “Artificial Intelligence” in their titles, the research examines key safety management factors, such as accident prevention, risk management, real-time monitoring, and ethical implementation, across sectors, including construction, industrial safety, disaster and public safety, transport and logistics, energy and power, health, smart home and living, and other diverse industries. AI-driven solutions, such as predictive analytics, machine learning algorithms, IoT sensor integration, and digital twin models, are shown to proactively identify and mitigate potential hazards, optimize energy consumption, and enhance operational efficiency. For instance, in the energy and power sector, intelligent gas meters and automated fire suppression systems manage gas-related risks effectively, while in the health sector, AI-powered health monitoring devices and mental health support applications improve patient and worker safety. The analysis reveals a significant trend towards shifting from reactive to proactive safety management, facilitated by the convergence of AI with IoT and Big Data analytics. Additionally, ethical considerations and data privacy emerge as critical challenges in the adoption of AI technologies. The study highlights the transformative role of AI in enhancing safety protocols, reducing accident rates, and improving overall safety outcomes across industries. It underscores the need for standardized protocols, robust AI governance frameworks, and interdisciplinary research to address existing challenges and maximize the benefits of AI in safety management. Future research directions include developing explainable AI models, enhancing human–AI collaboration, and fostering global standardization to ensure the responsible and effective implementation of AI-driven safety solutions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Bearings are vital components in machinery, and their malfunction can result in equipment damage and reduced productivity. As a result, considerable research attention has been directed toward the early detection of bearing faults. With recent rapid advancements in machine learning algorithms, there is increasing interest in proactively diagnosing bearing faults by analyzing signals obtained from bearings. Although numerous studies have introduced machine learning methods for bearing fault diagnosis, the high costs associated with sensors and data acquisition devices limit their practical application in industrial environments. Additionally, research aimed at identifying the root causes of faults through diagnostic algorithms has progressed relatively slowly. This study proposes a cost-effective monitoring system to improve economic feasibility. Its primary benefits include significant cost savings compared to traditional high-priced equipment, along with versatility and ease of installation, enabling straightforward attachment and removal. The system collects data by measuring the vibrations of both normal and faulty bearings under various operating conditions on a test bed. Using these data, a deep neural network is trained to enable real-time feature extraction and classification of bearing conditions. Furthermore, an explainable AI technique is applied to extract key feature values identified by the fault classification algorithm, providing a method to support the analysis of fault causes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Pediatric fracture overgrowth is an unpredictable complication of long bone fractures in children, leading to excessive growth of the injured limb and resulting in limb length discrepancies (LLDs) and angular deformities that impact mobility and quality of life. Traditional methods struggle to predict at-risk children, hindering early detection and management. Artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning and deep learning, offers advanced data analysis capabilities to enhance predictive accuracy and personalize treatment strategies. This comprehensive review explores the current understanding of pediatric fracture overgrowth, examines AI applications in medicine and orthopedics, evaluates potential AI applications specific to fracture overgrowth, and discusses ethical considerations and patient-centric approaches. We highlight how AI can improve diagnostic precision, facilitate early intervention, and optimize clinical outcomes. Though direct studies on AI in fracture overgrowth are limited, evidence from related areas underscores its potential. Embracing AI could revolutionize pediatric fracture management, leading to earlier detection, targeted interventions, and better outcomes for affected children. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The hindering of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signal reception by jamming and spoofing attacks degrades the signal quality. Careful attention needs to be paid when post-processing the signal under these circumstances before feeding the signal into the GNSS receiver’s post-processing stage. The identification of the time domain statistical attributes and the spectral domain characteristics play a vital role in analyzing the behaviour of the signal characteristics under various kinds of jamming attacks, spoofing attacks, and multipath scenarios. In this paper, the signal records of five disruptions (pure, continuous wave interference (CWI), multi-tone continuous wave interference (MCWI), multipath (MP), spoofing, pulse, and chirp) are examined, and the most influential features in both the time and frequency domains are identified with the help of explainable AI (XAI) models. Different Machine learning (ML) techniques were employed to assess the importance of the features to the model’s prediction. From the statistical analysis, it has been observed that the usage of the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) models in GNSS signals to test the types of disruption in unknown GNSS signals, using only the best-correlated and most important features in the training phase, provided a better classification accuracy in signal prediction compared to traditional feature selection methods. This XAI model reveals the black-box ML model’s output prediction and provides a clear explanation of the specific signal occurrences based on the individual feature contributions. By using this black-box revealer, we can easily analyze the behaviour of the GNSS ground-station signals and employ fault detection and resilience diagnosis in GNSS post-processing. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The relationship between coronary heart disease (CHD) and complex urban built environments remains a subject of considerable uncertainty. The development of predictive models via machine learning to explore the underlying mechanisms of this association, as well as the formulation of intervention policies and planning strategies, has emerged as a pivotal area of research. A cross-sectional dataset of hospital admissions for CHD over the course of a year from a hospital in Dalian City, China, was assembled and matched with multi-source built environment data via residential addresses. This study evaluates five machine learning models, including decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and support vector machine (SVM), and compares them with multiple linear regression models. The results show that DT, RF, and XGBoost exhibit superior predictive capabilities, with all R2 values exceeding 0.70. The DT model performed the best, with an R2 value of 0.818, and the best performance was based on metrics such as MAE and MSE. Additionally, using explainable AI techniques, this study reveals the contribution of different built environment factors to CHD and identifies the significant factors influencing CHD in cold regions, ranked as age, Digital Elevation Model (DEM), house price (HP), sky view factor (SVF), and interaction factors. Stratified analyses by age and gender show variations in the influencing factors for different groups: for those under 60 years old, Road Density is the most influential factor; for the 61–70 age group, house price is the top factor; for the 71–80 age group, age is the most significant factor; for those over 81 years old, building height is the leading factor; in males, GDP is the most influential factor; and in females, age is the most influential factor. This study explores the feasibility and performance of machine learning in predicting CHD risk in the built environment of cold regions and provides a comprehensive methodology and workflow for predicting cardiovascular disease risk based on refined neighborhood-level built environment factors, offering scientific support for the construction of sustainable healthy cities. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The accurate prediction of roof stress in mined-out areas is crucial for ensuring mine safety. However, existing study methods often overlook the increasingly available image data and fail to balance the model predictive capability with interpretability. To address these issues, this study innovatively integrates 3D laser scanning image features into the prediction of roof stress in mined-out areas. Image features are extracted using pre-trained deep-learning models and combined with traditional geological parameters to construct multiple machine-learning models for prediction. The experimental results demonstrate that models incorporating image features significantly outperform traditional models that rely solely on geological parameters in terms of prediction accuracy, interpretability, and complexity, revealing the critical role of image features in stress prediction. Furthermore, the use of SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to interpret the random forest model uncovers new domain knowledge, such as the relationship between spatial patterns and stress concentration. This study theoretically validates the effectiveness of image data and effectively balances the predictive capability and interpretability of the model, facilitating knowledge discovery in the field. On a practical level, it also provides guidance for mine safety management. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Potatoes are an essential global staple, but their susceptibility to various diseases poses a major threat to agricultural productivity. Thus, it is imperative to detect these diseases in good time to implement effective management strategies. In this study, we propose a reliable approach for the early detection of potato leaf diseases, which is based on transfer learning using the MobileNetV2 pre-trained model as a basis. In fact, by fine-tuning MobileNetV2’s architecture, we are adapting it to the specific task of classifying potato leaf diseases. This process has been closely monitored using eXplainable AI (XAI), which facilitated the identification of significant regions within the potato leaf images essential for accurate classification. Moreover, to mitigate potential overfitting without compromising performance, rigorous model training protocols are implemented, emphasizing convergence criteria that maximize predictive accuracy. Addressing the challenge of imbalanced dataset distributions inherent in disease classification tasks, we implement data augmentation techniques to enhance model generalization capabilities. Additionally, we propose a reweighting-based technique to account for class imbalance, thereby ensuring equitable representation across disease categories. The evaluation of the proposed approach on the PlantVillage dataset, a widely accepted reference in the field, showed a notable classification accuracy of 98.61%, underlining its effectiveness in disease identification. Furthermore, comprehensive analysis of recall, precision, and F1-score metrics reveals consistent performance across disease classes, indicative of the model’s robustness and reliability. This research enhances the current techniques for identifying potato diseases, benefiting the overall agricultural sustainability and protection of crops. Indeed, promising advancements in disease management could protect potato crops globally and guarantee food security for people worldwide. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study investigates the impact of media on color sense: our ability to see different colors and use them to interpret the world. Specifically, we examine the role of color in the cultural construction of the Orient—an ‘imagined geography’ used to justify colonial domination—in two turn-of-the-twentieth-century types of color(ed) photographs: photochromes, where a printer added color, and autochromes, where colors were captured during exposure. While most research on visual Orientalism has focused on content, we use machine learning methods to study the most important formal element of visual Orientalism: color. After using K-means clustering to extract sixteen dominant colors from each photograph in our dataset, we train three different random forest classification algorithms to make a distinction between (A) the two color media (B) photochromes of the Orient and the Occident; and (C) autochromes of the Orient and the Occident. Subsequently, we apply Shapley Additive Explanations, an explainable AI method, to interpret the output of the classifiers. This allows us to examine how specific features (colors) impacted the classifiers’ predictions. While the algorithm can easily separate photochromes from autochromes (0.95) and Oriental from Occidental photochromes (0.93), it struggles with the same task in the autochrome collection (0.68). These findings support three interconnected conclusions: (1) color sense became mediated in the late nineteenth century, (2) in photochromes, the presence and absence of specific colors was a vital aspect of visual Orientalism, (3) the autochrome, where color was derived from light, provided a more objective picture of countries in the near and middle East than the photochrome. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Epileptic seizure prediction plays a crucial role in enhancing the quality of life for individuals with epilepsy. Over recent years, a multitude of deep learning-based approaches have emerged to tackle this challenging task, leading to significant advancements. However, the ‘black-box’ nature of deep learning models and the considerable interpatient variability significantly impede their interpretability and generalization, thereby severely hampering their efficacy in real-world clinical applications. To address these issues, our study aims to establish an interpretable and generalizable seizure prediction model that meets the demands of clinical diagnosis. Our method extends self-interpretable prototype learning networks into a novel domain adaptation framework designed specifically for cross-patient seizure prediction. The proposed framework enables patient-level interpretability by tracing the origins of significant prototypes. For instance, it could provide information about the seizure type of the patient to which the prototype belongs. This surpasses the existing sample-level interpretability, which is limited to individual patient samples. To further improve the model's generalization capability, we introduce a contrastive semantic alignment loss constraint to the embedding space, enhancing the robustness of the learned prototypes. We evaluate our proposed model using the Freiburg intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) dataset, which consists of 20 patients and a total of 82 seizures. The experimental results demonstrated a high sensitivity of 79.0%, a low false prediction rate of 0.183, and a high area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value of 0.804, achieving state-of-the-art performance with self-interpretable evidence in contrast to the current cross-patient seizure prediction methods. Our study represents a significant step forward in developing an interpretable and generalizable model for seizure prediction, thereby facilitating the application of deep learning models in clinical diagnosis. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Pests significantly impact agricultural productivity, making early detection crucial for maximizing yields. This paper explores the use of machine learning models to predict olive fly and red spider mite infestations in Andalusia. Four datasets on crop phenology, pest populations, and damage levels were used, with models developed using the Python package H<inf>2</inf>O, which focuses on interpretability through SHAP values and ICE plots. The results showed high precision in predicting pest outbreaks, particularly for the olive fly, with minimal differences between models using feature selection. In the vineyard dataset, the selection of characteristics improved the performance of the model by reducing the MAE and increasing R2. Explainability techniques identified solar radiation and wind direction as key factors in olive fly predictions, while past pest occurrences and wind velocity were influential for red spider mites, providing farmers with actionable insights for timely pest control. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The traditional method for determining the Marshall stability (MS) and Marshall flow (MF) of asphalt pavements is laborious, time consuming, and costly. This study aims to predict these parameters using explainable machine-learning techniques. A comprehensive database comprising 721 hot mix asphalt (HMA) data points was established, including variables such as aggregate percentage, asphalt content, and specific gravity. Models were constructed using the PyCaret Python library, and their performance was assessed using metrics such as the mean absolute error (MAE) and coefficient of determination (R²). The CatBoost regression model outperformed the other models, achieving R² values of 0.835 and 0.845 for MS and MF, respectively. Additionally, Shapley values were used to quantify the variable effects on the predictions. This approach enables the efficient preselection of design variables, reducing the need for extensive laboratory testing and promoting sustainable construction practices. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Precise streamflow forecasting in river systems is crucial for water resources management and flood risk assessment. The Tagus Headwaters River Basin (THRB) in Spain is a key hydrological hub, providing regulated flow for agricultural, urban, and energy sectors, and facilitating water transfer to the Segura River Basin, a key semi-arid region. Given the basin's near-total allocation of water resources, accurate streamflow simulations are essential to optimize the socio-economic distribution and ensure sustainable management across both interconnected basins. This study conducts a comprehensive evaluation of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT+), support vector regression (SVR), feed forward neural network (FFNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) models in simulating the rainfall-runoff process at four gauging stations within the THRB. An ensemble machine learning technique is then applied to assess improvements in streamflow estimation. Results revealed that AI-based models significantly surpassed the SWAT+ model in performance. Furthermore, the application of an ensemble technique enhanced the precision of rainfall-runoff modeling by 18 to 26% during the calibration period and 4.1 to 9.2% during the validation period, compared to individual AI-based models. Additionally, the SWAT+ model's precision improved by 44 to 74% and 40 to 55% for the respective periods. The use of Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) methodology allowed the results of the ensemble with machine learning to be more interpretable by explaining how each model contributes to the prediction. This research offers significant contributions to hydrological modeling, highlighting the importance of ensemble techniques in elevating predictive accuracy for various river basins. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Geopolymer concrete (GC) emerges as a sustainable alternative yet faces challenges in achieving optimal resource utilization for strength development. Balancing these aspects is crucial for its large-scale adoption as a sustainable material. The type and dosage of precursors, activator, curing, and mixing conditions influence compressive strength, setting time, and workability. Moreover, multiple experimental trials are required for a desirable geopolymer blend. Even the experimental parameters alone do not meet the design principles concerning sustainable construction. This paper presents a study on the mix design and interpretation of machine learning techniques (MLT) with XAI. To train the model, extensive experimental databases using the shapley additive explanations (SHAP) technique rank input factors that impact the strength aspect. The prediction models' performance was compared using coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE). SHAP interpretations reveal that temperature, Na to Al ratio, and NaOH molarity are the main factors influencing the compressive strength of GC. Further, these parameters were crucial in developing the dense geopolymer matrix. By integrating XAI into the MLT approach, we have also opened new criteria for understanding the complex relationships between geopolymer concrete potential parameters and their compressive strength. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Inspired by the attractive features of least-squares theory in many practical applications, this contribution introduces least-squares-based deep learning (LSBDL). Least-squares theory connects explanatory variables to predicted variables, called observations, through a linear(ized) model in which the unknown parameters of this relation are estimated using the principle of least-squares. Conversely, deep learning (DL) methods establish nonlinear relationships for applications where predicted variables are unknown (nonlinear) functions of explanatory variables. This contribution presents the DL formulation based on least-squares theory in linear models. As a data-driven method, a network is trained to construct an appropriate design matrix of which its entries are estimated using two descent optimization methods: steepest descent and Gauss–Newton. In conjunction with interpretable and explainable artificial intelligence, LSBDL leverages the well-established least-squares theory for DL applications through the following three-fold objectives: (i) Quality control measures such as covariance matrix of predicted outcome can directly be determined. (ii) Available least-squares reliability theory and hypothesis testing can be established to identify mis-specification and outlying observations. (iii) Observations’ covariance matrix can be exploited to train a network with inconsistent, heterogeneous and statistically correlated data. Three examples are presented to demonstrate the theory. The first example uses LSBDL to train coordinate basis functions for a surface fitting problem. The second example applies LSBDL to time series forecasting. The third example showcases a real-world application of LSBDL to downscale groundwater storage anomaly data. LSBDL offers opportunities in many fields of geoscience, aviation, time series analysis, data assimilation and data fusion of multiple sensors. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Accurate prediction of surface settlement (SS) induced by deep foundation pit (DFP) excavation is challenging considering the complicated soil distributions and uncertain construction situations. Therefore, a Recurrent Gated Unit (GRU) neural network model incorporated with Variation Mode Decomposition (VMD) was developed for SS prediction. By data denoising with VMD and hyperparameter tuning using Bayesian Optimization (BO), the proposed GRU model achieved dynamic and accurate prediction of SS caused by DFP excavation. Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis was then performed to enhance the interpretability of the GRU model. The presented GRU model was validated with a case study of Wuhan Metro Line 12 Shiqiao Station. The results indicate that: (1) The GRU models with VMD data denoising technique achieved accurate prediction with the average RMSE of 0.0244, MAE of 0.0189, MAPE of 0.0017, R2 of 0.9894, and VAF of 99.1206. (2) The GRU model outperformed the other five state-of-the-art models in predictive performance with robustness improvement of 13.5 %, 12.0 %, 50.0 %, 29.2 %, and 27.3 %, separately, compared to the other five models. (3) The historical values of the SS make the most significant contributions to the outcomes of the GRU models. In short, this study enhances the accurate and dynamic prediction of SS caused by DFP excavation, contributing to the safe execution of DFP projects. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Motorcycle crashes pose a serious problem because their probability of causing casualties is greater than that of passenger vehicle crashes. Therefore, accurately identifying the factors that influence motorcycle crashes is essential for enhancing traffic safety and public health. The aim of this study was to address three major research gaps: first, existing studies have relatively overlooked the built environment in relation to visual factors; second, existing crash prediction models have not fully reflected the differences in built environment characteristics between areas with frequent motorcycle crashes and areas with frequent casualties; and third, multidimensional analysis for variable selection is limited, and the interpretability of the models is insufficient. Therefore, this study proposes a comprehensive framework for motorcycle crash and casualty estimation. The framework uses a data cube model incorporating OLAP operations to provide deeper insights into crash influencing factors at different levels of abstraction. We also utilized the XGBoost model to predict motorcycle high crash spots and casualty risk and integrate visual factors extracted from Google Street View images and community-level urban environments into the model. SHAP techniques were used to analyze and interpret the global and local feature importance of the models. Our results revealed that the factors affecting areas with frequent motorcycle crashes and the factors that affect casualties differ. In particular, visual factors such as vegetation and the sky ratio are important for estimating casualties. We aim to provide practical guidelines for a safe environment for motorcycle crashes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) exhibits significant promise in generating power from hydrogen energy. Operating parameters exert a direct influence on both the power output and the uniformity of oxygen distribution within the PEMFC. Therefore, quantifying the impact of operating parameters and identifying the optimal operating conditions are pivotal to enhance the performance and extend the lifespan of the PEMFC. To this end, a two-stage framework leveraging interpretable machine learning and multi-objective optimization is proposed. In the first stage, an interpretable surrogate model for the PEMFC is established. The impacts of single parameter and pairwise parameters on the power output and the oxygen distribution quality are quantified. Moreover, the decision variables are selected for the second stage. In the second stage, the optimal operating parameters are determined via multi-objective optimization. The results from the first stage suggest that operating voltage and pressure have the highest cumulative contribution for both power density and oxygen distribution quality.

AB  - Intra-urban induced heating (IUIH) in hot desert cities exhibits distinct patterns and complex diurnal interactions with built environment features, differing significantly from those in temperate areas and remains not fully understood. Understanding how various built environment features contribute to intra-urban thermal variability is an essential first step in developing sub-diurnal targeted heat mitigation strategies. This study presents a data-driven examination of IUIH dynamics in Kuwait's desert metropolis. Near-surface air temperature observations were collected using high-resolution loop-type traverses at selected hours during a representative summer day to determine IUIH variability. The diurnal impacts of built environment features were modeled using an ensemble learning approach and interpreted with SHapley Additive exPlanations. Among several candidate machine learning regressors evaluated, Random Forest demonstrated strong predictive power (R2 = 0.954) with acceptable error (RMSE = 0.096, MAPE = 0.001) and least bias (MBE = 0.008). The study's significance lies in its assessment framework that emphasizes explainability of sub-diurnal dynamics, offering detailed insights that challenge traditional assumptions and inform both immediate local climate interventions and strategic urban planning. The findings reveal that simple day-evening comparatives might overlook nuanced sub-diurnal dynamics, such as potential irrigation-induced warming by shrubs observed at mid-day and the complex trade-offs between radiative and transpirative processes by trees in the afternoon and evening. Additionally, the study identifies cooling effects associated with natural land cover, presenting a critical optimization challenge between compact and open urban forms to effectively modulate near-surface air temperatures. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Addressing real-world challenges in battery diagnostics, particularly under incomplete or inconsistent boundary conditions, has proven difficult with traditional methodologies such as first-principles and atomistic calculations. Despite advances in data assimilation techniques, the overwhelming volume and diversity of data, coupled with the lack of universally accepted models, underscore the limitations of these traditional approaches. Recently, deep learning has emerged as a highly effective tool in overcoming persistent issues in battery diagnostics by adeptly managing expansive design spaces and discerning intricate, multidimensional correlations. This approach resolves challenges previously deemed insurmountable, especially with lost, irregular, or noisy data through the design of specialized network architectures that adhere to physical invariants. However, gaps remain between academic advancements and their practical applications, including challenges in explainability and the computational costs associated with AI-driven solutions. Emerging technologies such as explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), AI for IT operations (AIOps), lifelong machine learning to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, and cloud-based digital twins open new opportunities for intelligent battery life-cycle assessment. In this perspective, we outline these challenges and opportunities, emphasizing the potential of innovative technologies to transform battery diagnostics, as demonstrated by our recent practice and the progress made in the field. This includes promising achievements in both academic and industry field demonstrations in modeling and forecasting the dynamics of multiphysics and multiscale battery systems. These systems feature inhomogeneous cascades of scales, informed by our physical, electrochemical, observational, empirical, and/or mathematical understanding of the battery system. Through data assimilation efforts, meticulous craftsmanship, and elaborate implementations—and by considering the wealth and spatio-temporal heterogeneity of available data—such AI-based intelligent learning philosophies have great potential to achieve better accuracy, faster training, and improved generalization. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study proposed a performance-interpretable deep learning model for rolling bearing fault diagnosis that integrates an intelligent fusion of sound and vibration signals and self-supervised learning via an interpretable attention mechanism. A deep learning decoder framework with a compressed attention mechanism encoder is developed to automatically learn the correlation between sound and vibration signals and the fusion method, eliminating the need for manual feature extraction and multi-model construction. By introducing the dynamic attention mechanism, the strength of the correlation between sound and vibration signals can be sensed in real-time to adapt to different scenarios flexibly. When the correlation is strong, due to the high similarity between the signals, a complex feature weight fusion strategy is employed to extract and fuse the essential features of different modalities more efficiently, enabling this fusion to mutually enhance the expressive power of the features for feature fusion. Whereas, when the correlation is weak, the correlation between the signals is low and forcing a complex fusion may introduce more noise and redundant information, therefore a hybrid input strategy is used. The CAME-Transformer Decoder (CAME-TD) model dynamically updates the correlation thresholds and fusion strategies using regularized loss constraints to ensure adaptation to multimodal signal differences. During model training, visual analysis of the attention mechanism role weights and feature learning helps in parameter optimization and performance evaluation. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, with an improvement in fault diagnosis performance under various operating and noise conditions compared to a single signal input. Moreover, the CAME-TD model not only achieves considerable diagnostic performance but also enhances interpretability, providing a new approach for rolling bearing fault diagnosis. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In quest of improving the productivity and efficiency of manufacturing processes, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being used extensively for response prediction, model dimensionality reduction, process optimization, and monitoring. Though having superior accuracy, AI predictions are unintelligible to the end users and stakeholders due to their opaqueness. Thus, building interpretable and inclusive machine learning (ML) models is a vital part of the smart manufacturing paradigm to establish traceability and repeatability. The study addresses this fundamental limitation of AI-driven manufacturing processes by introducing a novel Explainable AI (XAI) approach to develop interpretable processes and product fingerprints. Here the explainability is implemented in two stages: by developing interpretable representations for the fingerprints, and by posthoc explanations. Also, for the first time, the concept of process fingerprints is extended to develop an interpretable probabilistic model for bottleneck events during manufacturing processes. The approach is demonstrated using two datasets: nanosecond pulsed laser ablation to produce superhydrophobic surfaces and wire EDM real-time monitoring dataset during the machining of Inconel 718. The fingerprint identification is performed using a global Lipschitz functions optimization tool (MaxLIPO) and a stacked ensemble model is used for response prediction. The proposed interpretable fingerprint approach is robust to change in processes and can responsively handle both continuous and categorical responses alike. Implementation of XAI not only provided useful insights into the process physics but also revealed the decision-making logic for local predictions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Flight incidents are characterized by complex mechanisms, leading to poor prediction model robustness and explainability. Based on the full-dimensional description of flight incidents, the explainable module is added to the prediction model to achieve its accuracy, stability, and explainability. Firstly, imbalance processing is performed employing the sampling method, and a genetic algorithm (GA) is applied for feature selection; these results are then considered as prediction model input. Secondly, an extreme gradient boosting algorithm (XGBoost)-based incident severity prediction model is established with five categories of none, minor, serious, fatal, and total as prediction labels; real data is used for validation, and the model shows good robustness and superiority. Finally, the SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) is introduced to explain the correlation between incidents severity and input features and to measure feature importance. The results show that the proposed method has higher prediction accuracy and robustness. Which can provide some decision-making reference for aviation operation management departments to emergencies, learn the deep-seated law of incidents, and promote the paradigm of active safety management. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Abstract: Constructing interpretable machine learning models that are able to explain the result of the inference process is an important factor to increase the level of confidence and trust in the machine learning models and their results, especially in medicine. Fuzzy classifiers are interpretable in nature because they consist of IF-THEN rules and use fuzzy terms used in colloquial speech. For the construction of fuzzy classifiers, the authors use a three-stage construction method consisting of a structure generation stage, a feature selection stage, and a rule parameter optimization stage. This paper focuses on the feature selection stage. At this stage, swallow swarm and leaping frogs binary metaheuristic algorithms are used for feature selection by wrapper method. Various implementations of binarization algorithms are proposed to convert the search space from continuous to discrete. Experiments on classifier construction and statistical evaluation of the effectiveness of the resulting models were performed, which showed a significant advantage in feature reduction compared to genetic fuzzy systems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Current machine learning models under artificial intelligence can only improve prediction accuracy, but their underlying logic remains incomprehensible. Therefore, to provide high prediction accuracy and enhance the interpretability of the model through machine learning, the study selects the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model by comparing multiple models under single learner and integrated learning. Then a cancer probability statistical prediction model is constructed through parameter optimization, and its performance and interpretability are analyzed. The experimental results showed that the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Area under Curve (AUC) value in the single learner was generally lower than 80%, while the AUC value was 84.4%, surpassing that of the comparison model. Simultaneously, an increase in Alpha-Fetoprotein value greater than 13.5 had a stronger predictive effect when combined with other factors. Smaller serum Alanine Aminotransferase and Alpha-Fetoprotein assay near 0 may produce negative or positive effects, whereas a higher value is more likely to produce a positive effect. This is in line with its clinical significance. Overall, XGBoost effectively improves the out-of-sample prediction accurate and interpretability, which is significant for the actual liver cancer diagnosis prediction. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The accurate assessment of tsunami-induced damage to coastal roads is crucial for effective disaster risk management. Traditional approaches, reliant on univariate fragility functions, often fail to capture the complex interplay of variables influencing road damage during tsunami events. This study addresses this limitation by employing machine learning techniques on an extensive dataset compiled after the 2011 Great East Japan tsunami. The dataset, enriched with additional explicative variables accounting for the hydraulic features of the event and the physical characteristics at roads’ location, enables a comprehensive analysis of road damage mechanisms. Results indicate that while inundation depth remains a significant predictor, factors such as wave approach angle, road orientation and potential overflow from inland watercourses also play critical roles. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study developed two prediction models for urban fire occurrence and related casualties via a fire accident dataset from Seoul, South Korea, from 2017 to 2021. Our models exhibit improved predictive performance by incorporating built environment features, such as building characteristics and the urban context, alongside weather and demographic data. This approach showed improved predictive performance suitable for public health implementation. Compared with the weather- and demographic-only models, our models had an 18.1 % greater fire occurrence prediction accuracy and a 10.4 % greater casualty prediction accuracy. Major variables affecting fire occurrence include building characteristics, e.g., the floor area ratio (FAR), building age, and commercial building number. Important features affecting casualty occurrence include demographic aspects, e.g., income level and weather, and network-based features, e.g., road connectivity and fire station proximity. These findings suggest that fire prevention strategies and fire casualty prevention strategies may need to differ. Furthermore, we identify high-risk zones by conducting spatial analysis and fire risk and casualty prediction on all buildings by applying our models to Seoul's Gangnam District. These contributions can promote safe and healthy urban environments by improving fire risk prediction accuracy and providing important insights into urban planning for appropriate urban fire accident response and prevention. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Scientific knowledge of the spatio-temporal evolution processes and formation mechanisms of territorial space in countries along the Central Asia-West Asia Economic Corridor holds significant scientific value and practical importance for supporting the current "Going Global" strategy and the "Belt and Road" initiative. Based on the dominant functions of the territories, the Central Asia-West Asia Economic Corridor is divided into three major types of territorial space: urban and rural construction, agricultural production, and ecological protection. A long-term analysis base map of territorial space from 2002 to 2022 was constructed by integrating multisource spatio-temporal data. The spatio-temporal cube model was employed to depict the spatio-temporal evolution processes and typical patterns, while the integrated spatial transformation intensity model analyzed the characteristics of spatial structural transformation across three dimensions: scale, location, and intensity. The VIVI-SHAP framework of an interpretable machine learning model was used to analyze the evolution mechanisms, focusing on the importance of driving factors, interaction intensity, and non-linear dependencies. The results show that: (1) Approximately 6.14% of the territorial space in countries along the corridor underwent structural transformation over the past 20 years. The proportion of urban and rural construction space, though small, increased steadily by 0.17%, while agricultural production space decreased by 19.04% overall, with significant structural changes within the ecological protection space. (2) The dynamic interchange between green and other ecological spaces within the ecological protection space is predominant, with a systematic tendency for green ecological space to convert into agricultural production space, while the main source of urban and rural construction space expansion was green ecological space, accounting for 56.36% of the total converted area. 3) The territorial spatial pattern of the corridor is shaped by multiple processes of territorial space transformation, each with different magnitudes, intensities, and driving mechanisms. Natural geographic factors and transportation location factors played decisive roles, while the global influence of population growth and socio-economic development on territorial space structural transformation was less pronounced. This study provides new perspectives and methods to reveal the patterns and mechanisms of changes in land spatial types in the Central Asia-West Asia region. It further provides data support for decision-making departments to formulate reasonable land spatial planning, and demonstrates its application value in achieving greater spatial comprehensive benefits and promoting coordinated regional economic development. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Faults in the wafer transfer robots (WTRs) used in semiconductor manufacturing processes can significantly affect productivity. This study defines high-risk components such as bearing motors, ball screws, timing belts, robot hands, and end effectors, and generates fault data for each component based on Fluke’s law. A stacking classifier was applied for fault prediction and severity classification, and logistic regression was used to identify fault components. Additionally, to analyze the frequency bands affecting each failed component and assess the severity of faults involving two mixed components, a hybrid explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) model combining Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) was employed to inform the user about the component causing the fault. This approach demonstrated a high prediction accuracy of 95%, and its integration into real-time monitoring systems is expected to reduce maintenance costs, decrease equipment downtime, and ultimately improve productivity. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The increasing knowledge of microbial ecology in food products relating to quality and safety and the established usefulness of machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection in multiple scenarios suggests that the application of microbiome data in food production systems for anomaly detection could be a valuable approach to be used in food systems. These methods could be used to identify ingredients that deviate from their typical microbial composition, which could indicate food fraud or safety issues. The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of using shotgun sequencing data as input into anomaly detection algorithms using fluid milk as a model system. Contrastive principal component analysis (PCA), cluster-based methods, and explainable artificial intelligence (AI) were evaluated for the detection of two anomalous sample classes using longitudinal metagenomic profiling of fluid milk compared to baseline (BL) samples collected under comparable circumstances. Traditional methods (alpha and beta diversity, clustering-based contrastive PCA, multidimensional scaling, and dendrograms) failed to differentiate anomalous sample classes; however, explainable AI was able to classify anomalous vs baseline samples and indicate microbial drivers in association with antibiotic use. We validated the potential for explainable AI to classify different milk sources using larger publicly available fluid milk 16S rDNA sequencing data sets and demonstrated that explainable AI is able to differentiate between milk storage methods, processing stages, and seasons. Our results indicate that the application of artificial intelligence continues to hold promise in the realm of microbiome data analysis and could present further opportunities for downstream analytic automation to aid in food safety and quality. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Optimizing agricultural productivity and promoting sustainability necessitates accurate predictions of crop yields to ensure food security. Various agricultural and climatic variables are included in the analysis, encompassing crop type, year, season, and the specific climatic conditions of the Indian state during the crop’s growing season. Features such as crop and season were one-hot encoded. The primary objective was to predict yield using a deep neural network (DNN), with hyperparameters optimized through genetic algorithms (GAs) to maximize the R2 score. The best-performing model, achieved by fine-tuning its hyperparameters, achieved an R2 of 0.92, meaning it explains 92% of the variation in crop yields, indicating high predictive accuracy. The optimized DNN models were further analyzed using explainable AI (XAI) techniques, specifically local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME), to elucidate feature importance and enhance model interpretability. The analysis underscored the significant role of features such as crops, leading to the incorporation of an additional dataset to classify the most optimal crops based on more detailed soil and climate data. This classification task was also executed using a GA-optimized DNN, aiming to maximize accuracy. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in predicting crop yields and classifying optimal crops. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - There have recently been rapid developments in smart healthcare systems, such as precision diagnosis, smart diet management, and drug discovery. These systems require the integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) for data acquisition, Digital Twins (DT) for data representation into a digital replica and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for decision-making. DT is a digital copy or replica of physical entities (e.g., patients), one of the emerging technologies that enable the advancement of smart healthcare systems. AI and Machine Learning (ML) offer great benefits to DT-based smart healthcare systems. They also pose certain risks, including security risks, and bring up issues of fairness, trustworthiness, explainability, and interpretability. One of the challenges that still make the full adaptation of AI/ML in healthcare questionable is the explainability of AI (XAI) and interpretability of ML (IML). Although the study of the explainability and interpretability of AI/ML is now a trend, there is a lack of research on the security of XAI-enabled DT for smart healthcare systems. Existing studies limit their focus to either the security of XAI or DT. This paper provides a brief overview of the research on the security of XAI-enabled DT for smart healthcare systems. It also explores potential adversarial attacks against XAI-enabled DT for smart healthcare systems. Additionally, it proposes a framework for designing XAI-enabled DT for smart healthcare systems that are secure and trusted. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The expansion of e-scooter sharing system has introduced several novel interactions within the existing transportation system. However, few studies have explored how spatial contexts influence these interactions. To fill this gap, this study explored the spatial heterogeneity in e-scooter's relationship with ridesourcing using data from Chicago, IL. We developed a Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) to estimate e-scooter sharing usage using ridesourcing trips along with associated built environment and socio-demographic variables. The model was interpreted using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Results indicated that the threshold effects, where the positive relationship between e-scooter sharing and ridesourcing significantly weakened beyond a certain value, were more pronounced in areas with lower population density, fewer jobs, and fewer young, highly educated population. This is primarily attributed to the limited competitiveness of e-scooter sharing in these areas. These findings can assist cities in harmonizing e-scooter sharing and ridesourcing thus promoting sustainable transportation systems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Uncovering the association between built environment (BE) attributes and community park visits by considering potential nonlinear effects can inform more effective spatial policies. This study utilizes real-time population visitation big data to depict the spatial variances in community park visits in the case city of Shenzhen. An explainable machine learning method incorporating random forest and Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is applied to reveal the relative importance of BE attributes and to examine the nonlinear associations and interaction effects on park visits. The results confirm the decisive roles of park size and walking-based street connectivity on associating with visits, with threshold points at 2 hm2for park size and 0.3 for network warp. The revealed interaction between park size and surrounding BE attributes benefits defining the optimal scale by considering surrounding attributes of both attraction and demand factors. Based on the findings, we further discuss the possible patterns of threshold effects and interaction effects rooted in the examined nonlinearity. The findings guide policy makers in adopting smarter and more effective strategies to improve community park visits. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - We present an exciting journey from 3D point-cloud data (PCD) to the state of the art in graph neural networks (GNNs) and their evolution with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), and 3D geometric priors with the human-in-the-loop. We follow a simple definition of a “digital twin,” as a high-precision, three-dimensional digital representation of a physical object or environment, captured, for example, by Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology. After a digression into transforming PCD into images, graphs, combinatorial complexes and hypergraphs, we explore recent developments in geometric deep learning (GDL) and provide insight into the application of these network architectures for analyzing and learning from graph-structured data. We emphasize the importance of the explainability of these models and recognize that the ability to interpret and validate the results of complex models is a crucial aspect of their wider adoption.

AB  - The metro, renowned as an environmentally friendly mode of transportation due to its low energy consumption and minimal pollution, plays a crucial role in achieving sustainable urban growth. Due to the scarcity of information in the early stages of metro construction projects and the subjectivity of cost estimation (which relies heavily on the estimator's experience), it is always difficult to guarantee the accuracy of metro construction project cost estimation. Furthermore, the existing methodological models commonly used for cost estimation do not adequately consider the interpretability of the estimation results, making it difficult to promote their application in real-world scenarios. In this paper, an interpretable machine learning method is introduced into the study of cost estimation of metro construction projects, and a maximum relevance and minimum redundancy (mRMR)-light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM)-Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) interpretable assisted investment decision-making framework is proposed. The results show that the negative impact of variable multicollinearity on model prediction is avoided by quantitatively identifying the key driving variables of costing through mRMR based on the historical data of metro construction projects and macroeconomic data. LightGBM is employed to predict the cost of metro construction projects with a mean absolute percentage error of 13.00%, surpassing the accuracy of the five baseline models. The SHAP method's introduction explains the influence of key driving variables on the model prediction response at both global and local levels, which improves the decision trust of the cost estimation of metro construction projects. The study takes into account the impact of key driving variables on the model's prediction response in a real-world context and balances the needs for estimation accuracy and variable interpretability in real-world scenarios. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - As electric bikes (e-bikes) rapidly develop in China, their traffic safety issues are becoming increasingly prominent. Accurately detecting risky riding behaviors and conducting mechanism analysis on the multiple risk factors are crucial in formulating and implementing precise management policies. The emergence of shared e-bikes and the advancements in interpretable machine learning present new opportunities for accurately analyzing the determinants of risky riding behaviors. The primary objective of this study is to examine and analyze the risk factors related to speeding behavior to aid urban management agencies in crafting necessary management policies. This study utilizes a large-scale dataset of shared e-bike trajectory data to establish a framework for detecting speeding behavior. Subsequently, the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model is employed to identify the level of speeding risk by leveraging its excellent identification ability. Moreover, based on measuring the degree of interaction among road, traffic, and weather characteristics, the investigation of the complex interactive effects of these risk factors on high-risk speeding is conducted using bivariate partial dependence plots (PDP) by its superior parsing ability. Feature importance analysis results indicate that the top five ranked variables that significantly affect the identified results of speed risk levels are land use density, rainfall, road level, curbside parking density, and bike lane width. The interaction analysis results indicate that higher levels of road and bike lane width correspond to an increased possibility of high-risk speeding among riders. Land use density, curbside parking density, and rainfall display a nonlinear effect on high-risk speeding. Introducing road level, bike lane width, and time interval could change the patterns of nonlinear effects in land use density, curbside parking density, and rainfall. Finally, several policy recommendations are proposed to improve e-bike traffic safety by utilizing the extracted feature values associated with a higher probability of high-risk speeding. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The accurate prediction of occupancy rates within the residential sector is pivotal for urban and energy planning and management. This study aims at addressing the often-neglected influence of regional variations within urban settings on occupancy rates by employing multi-source urban data and explainable machine learning algorithms. Utilizing mobile signaling data from January and July 2022 in Guangzhou, we developed prediction models using the CatBoost algorithm with hyperparameters finely tuned via Bayesian optimization. The SHapley Additive exPlanation was applied to elucidate the influence of different urban configurations. Our findings reveal significant seasonal variations and distinct differences between weekdays and weekends, showing higher occupancy rates in winter than in summer and elevated rates during weekends. Additionally, significant fluctuations were observed among different age groups on weekdays. The prediction models exhibited robust capabilities, achieving R2 values exceeding 0.95 for weekdays and 0.91 for weekends. Key findings highlight that the density of points of interest related to shopping and food, along with variability in building heights, significantly impact occupancy rates. The influence of diverse urban configurations varies across different hours of the day. By the comprehensive analysis of regional variations and the application of advanced machine learning techniques to predict and explain residential occupancy rates, this research offers tools to optimize the management and sustainability of built environments, enhances the understanding of urban operation patterns and contributes to advancing smart city technologies, providing valuable insights for urban and energy planning. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Deterioration of the thermal environment in built-up areas poses a serious threat to human health, comfort, and urban infrastructure, while also increasing energy consumption and carbon emissions. This underscores the need to optimize wind environments as a key mitigation strategy for urban areas. This paper analyzed the effects of human activities and natural factors on local cold air in Tianhe District, Guangzhou, from the perspective of local ventilation systems. The KLAM_21 (Kaltluft Abfluss Modell) was used to simulate local cold air flow and delineate climate functional zones. A random forest model, interpreted with the SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method, assessed the impact of various factors on local cold air dynamics. The study found that: (1) The northern mountainous area is a crucial cold source; (2) Some open spaces in the built environment fail to function as effective local cold air corridors; (3) High-intensity urban development hinders local cold air transmission; (4) Water bodies are more effective than green spaces in collecting and transmitting local cold air. This study provided technical methods for identifying climate functional zones and understanding local cold air dynamics, as well as theoretical support for the construction of local ventilation systems in urban areas. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The causes of traffic violations by elderly drivers are different from those of other age groups. To reduce serious traffic violations that are more likely to cause serious traffic crashes, this study divided the severity of traffic violations into three levels (i.e., slight, ordinary, severe) based on point deduction, and explore the patterns of serious traffic violations (i.e., ordinary, severe) using multi-source data. This paper designed an interpretable machine learning framework, in which four popular machine learning models were enhanced and compared. Specifically, adaptive synthetic sampling method was applied to overcome the effects of imbalanced data and improve the prediction accuracy of minority classes (i.e., ordinary, severe); multi-objective feature selection based on NSGA-II was used to remove the redundant factors to increase the computational efficiency and make the patterns discovered by the explainer more effective; Bayesian hyperparameter optimization aimed to obtain more effective hyperparameters combination with fewer iterations and boost the model adaptability. Results show that the proposed interpretable machine learning framework can significantly improve and distinguish the performance of four popular machine learning models and two post-hoc interpretation methods. It is found that six of the top ten important factors belong to multi-scale built environment attributes. By comparing the results of feature contribution and interaction effects, some findings can be summarized: ordinary and severe traffic violations have some identical influencing factors and interactive effects; have the same influencing factors or the same combinations of influencing factors, but the values of the factors are different; have some unique influencing factors and unique combinations of influencing factors. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - While Artificial intelligence (AI) has been successfully applied in assessing geotechnical risk, such methods heavily rely on data quality to achieve satisfactory performance, and their results hardly can be interpreted due to their opaque design. With this in mind, this paper aims to address the following research gap: How can we accurately model geotechnical risks using limited data and domain knowledge, and efficiently explain the results of AI model? We develop a physics-guided transfer learning (PGTL) model to enhance the explainability and accuracy of geotechnical risk modeling. With the help of a physical model that simulates the tunnel excavation, a physics-guided dataset with 1000 samples is established and used to train a deep neural network. On these bases, transfer learning is adopted to fuse the features of physics mechanisms and monitoring data, constructing an explainable prediction model of geotechnical risk. To further support risk decision-making, feature relevance techniques are employed to assess the contribution of input parameters to risk. A shield tunnel construction in Wuhan is selected as a case to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The PGTL exhibits a more promising accuracy with R2 of 0.777 in contrast to three popular machine learning approaches, and provides insights into parameters that significantly induce risk, enhancing site managers’ understanding of tunnel construction and being conducive to tunnel safety. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The accurate prediction of residual compressive strength (RCS) of concrete plays a critical role in assessing concrete constructions' safety and structural integrity following exposure to elevated temperatures. Existing ensemble models exhibit RCS prediction capabilities, yet they are constrained by their opaque nature. This research endeavors to develop an intelligible model for RCS by employing five ensemble machine-learning models, namely, random forest (RF), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), gradient boosting (GBoost), light gradient boosting (LGBoost), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and integrating Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) to ascertain the precise importance of each input variable in forecasting the RCS of concrete under elevated temperature conditions. The input variables encompass concrete type, compressive strength, aggregate type, water-cement ratio, heating type, heating rate, maximum core temperature, and cooling type. Model performance is appraised using established performance metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), root-mean squared error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R2). The analytical results exhibit the efficacy of employing machine-learning models in accurately predicting the RCS of concrete under elevated temperature conditions. Among the implemented models, XGBoost demonstrated the highest performance, yielding an R2 value of 0.876, closely trailed by the LGBoost model at 0.871. The SHAP analysis elucidates the crucial role of core temperature, water-cement ratio, heating rate, and compressive strength in determining the RCS of concrete. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Optimizing shared resources across multiple clients is a complex challenge in the production, logistics, and service sectors. This study addresses the underexplored area of forecasting service costs for non-cooperative clients, which is essential for sustainable business management. We propose a framework that merges Operations Research (OR) and Machine Learning (ML) to fill this gap. It begins by applying the OR model to historical instances, optimizing resource allocation, and determining equitable service cost allocations for each client. These allocations serve as training targets for ML models, which are trained using a combination of original and augmented client data, aiming to reliably project service costs and support competitive, sustainable pricing strategies. The framework’s efficacy is demonstrated in a reverse logistics case study, benchmarked against two traditional cost estimation methods for new clients. Comparative analysis shows that our framework outperforms these methods in terms of predictive accuracy, highlighting its superior effectiveness. The integration of OR and ML offers a significant decision-support mechanism, improving sustainable business strategies across sectors. Our framework provides a scalable solution for cost forecasting and resource optimization, marking progress toward a circular, sustainable economy by accurately estimating costs and promoting efficient operations. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex, chronic, and heterogeneous disease of the central nervous system that affects 3 million people globally. The multifactorial nature of MS necessitates an adaptive and personalized approach to diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment. This paper proposes a novel Digital Twin for Multiple Sclerosis (DTMS) designed to integrate diverse data sources, including Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), clinical biomarkers, and digital health metrics, into a unified predictive model. The DTMS aims to enhance the precision of MS management by providing real-time, individualized insights into disease progression and treatment efficacy. Through a federated learning approach, the DTMS leverages explainable AI to offer reliable and personalized therapeutic recommendations, ultimately striving to delay disability and improve patient outcomes. This comprehensive digital framework represents a significant advancement in the application of AI and digital twins in the field of neurology, promising a more tailored and effective management strategy for MS. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Credit scoring is a critical tool for risk management in financial lending. Although traditional statistical and machine learning models have been extensively researched over the years, the trend has shifted towards deep learning models due to their enhanced performance across various fields. Despite the superior performance of deep learning models, their opaque nature poses challenges for their adoption in credit scoring. The inability to understand how these models arrive at their decisions is problematic, especially in fields where decisions are critical. Leveraging the credit dataset from Germany on the UCI repository, our approach integrates cutting-edge explanation techniques to ensure that predictions are accurate but also interpretable and justifiable. Our study implemented the following models: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-term Memory (LSTM), Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), Autoencoder, Graph Neural Network (GNN), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and introduced two hybrid models one that combines MLP & RBM models and another that combines the LSTM & CNN models, achieving ROC-AUC scores of 76.3%, 78.7%, 69.1%, 60.3%, 62.3%, 75.7%, 75.5%, and 76.2% respectively. We also applied the following Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques: Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (Lime), and Integrated Gradients. The application of LRP revealed significant feature influences across different layers, SHAP highlighted the positive and negative impacts of specific features on model predictions, while LIME offered detailed local interpretations, and Integrated Gradients quantified the contribution of each feature to the prediction decisions. Overall, these XAI methods have set a new benchmark for transparency and reliability, crucial for ethical AI deployments in financial decision-making. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Context. Risk analysis assesses potential risks in specific scenarios. Risk analysis principles are context-less; the same methodology can be applied to a risk connected to health and information technology security. Risk analysis requires a vast knowledge of national and international regulations and standards and is time and effort-intensive. A large language model can quickly summarize information in less time than a human and can be fine-tuned to specific tasks. Aim. Our empirical study aims to investigate the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation and fine-tuned LLM in Risk analysis. To our knowledge, no prior study has explored its capabilities in risk analysis. Method. We manually curated 193 unique scenarios leading to 1283 representative samples from over 50 mission-critical analyses archived by the industrial context team in the last five years. We compared the base GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models versus their Retrieval-Augmented Generation and fine-tuned counterparts. We employ two human experts as competitors of the models and three other three human experts to review the models and the former human expert's analysis. The reviewers analyzed 5,000 scenario analyses. Results and Conclusions. HEs demonstrated higher accuracy, but LLMs are quicker and more actionable. Moreover, our findings show that RAG-assisted LLMs have the lowest hallucination rates, effectively uncovering hidden risks and complementing human expertise. Thus, the choice of model depends on specific needs, with FTMs for accuracy, RAG for hidden risks discovery, and base models for comprehensiveness and actionability. Therefore, experts can leverage LLMs for an effective complementing companion in risk analysis within a condensed timeframe. They can also save costs by averting unnecessary expenses associated with implementing unwarranted countermeasures. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Complex sequential decision-making planning problems, covering infinite states' space have been shown to be solvable by AlphaZero type of algorithms. Such an approach that trains a neural model while simulating projection of futures with a Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm were shown to be applicable to real life planning problems. As such, engineers and users interacting with the resulting policy of behavior might benefit from obtaining automated explanations about these planners' decisions offline or online. This paper focuses on the information within the Monte Carlo Tree Search data structure. Given its construction, this information contains much of the reasoning of the sequential decision-making algorithm and is essential for its explainability. We show novel methods using information theoretic tools for the simplification and reduction of the Monte Carlo Tree Search and the extraction of information. Such information can be directly used for the construction of human understandable explanations. We show that basic explainability quantities can be calculated with limited additional computational cost, as an integrated part of the Monte Carlo Tree Search construction process. We focus on the theoretical and algorithmic aspects and provide examples of how the methods presented here can be used in the construction of human understandable explanations. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Bound extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) are complex, high-molecular-weight polymer mixtures that play a critical role in pore clogging, foulants adhesion, and fouling layer formation during membrane filtration, owing to their adhesive properties and gelation tendencies. In this study, a novel electrochemical anaerobic membrane bioreactor (EC-AnMBR) was constructed to investigate the effect of sludge bound-EPS solubilization on methane bioconversion and membrane fouling mitigation. During the 150-days’ operation, the EC-AnMBR demonstrated remarkable performance, characterized by an exceptionally low fouling rate (transmembrane pressure (TMP) < 4.0 kPa) and high-quality effluent (COD removal > 98.2 %, protein removal > 97.7 %, and polysaccharide removal > 98.5 %). The highest methane productivity was up to 38.0 ± 3.1 mL/L<inf>reactor</inf>/d at the applied voltage of 0.8 V with bound-EPS solubilization, 107.6 % higher than that of the control stage (18.3 ± 2.4 mL/L<inf>reactor</inf>/d). Morphological and multiplex fluorescence labeling analyses revealed higher fluorescence intensities of proteins, polysaccharides, total cells and lipids on the surface of the fouling layer. In contrast, the interior exhibited increased compression density and reduced activity, likely attributable to compression effect. Under the synergistic influence of the electric field and bound-EPS solubilization, biomass characteristics exhibited a reduced propensity for membrane fouling. Furthermore, the bio-electrochemical regulation enhanced the electroactivity of microbial aggregates and enriched functional microorganisms, thereby promoting biofilm growth and direct interspecies electron transfer. Additionally, the potential hydrogenotrophic and methylotrophic methanogenesis pathways were enhanced at the cathode and anode surfaces, thereby increasing CH₄ productivity. The random forest-based machine learning model analyzed the nonlinear contributions of EPS characteristics on methane productivity and TMP values, achieving R² values of 0.879 and 0.848, respectively. Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) analysis indicated that S-EPS<inf>PS</inf> and S-EPS<inf>PN</inf> were the most critical factors affecting CH₄ productivity and membrane fouling, respectively. Partial dependence plot analysis further verified the marginal and interaction effects of different EPS layers on these outcomes. By combining continuous operation with interpretable machine learning algorithms, this study unveils the intricate impacts of EPS characteristics on methane productivity and membrane fouling behaviors, and provides new insights into sludge bound-EPS solubilization in EC-AnMBR. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In the semiconductor manufacturing industry, efficient operation of wafer transfer robots has a direct impact on productivity and product quality. Ball screw misalignment anomalies are a critical factor affecting precision transport of robots. Early diagnosis of these anomalies is essential to maintaining system efficiency. This study proposed a method to effectively diagnose ball screw misalignment anomalies using 1D-CNN and 2D-CNN models. This method mainly uses binary classification to distinguish between normal and abnormal states. Additionally, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) technology was applied to interpret diagnostic decisions of the two deep learning models, allowing users to convince prediction results of the AI model. This study was based on data collected through acceleration sensors and torque sensors. It compared accuracies of 1D-CNN and 2D-CNN models. It presents a method to explain the model's predictions through XAI. Experimental results showed that the proposed method could diagnose ball screw misalignment anomalies with high accuracy. This is expected to contribute to the establishment of reliable abnormality diagnosis and preventive maintenance strategies in industrial sites. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Rotating machinery plays an essential role in various industrial processes such as manufacturing, power generation, and transportation. These machines, which include turbines, pumps, motors, compressors, and many others, are the heartbeats of numerous industries. The seamless operation of these machines is critical for the efficiency and productivity of these sectors. However, over time, these machines degrade and can suffer faults. One of the most critical components are bearings, which can suffer different types of faults. This paper presents a novel approach for bearing fault classification and diagnosis under limited data. A Monotonic Smoothed Stacked AutoEncoder (MS2AE) is used to infer a smoothed monotonic health index from raw bearing acceleration data. The MS2AE is trained using only healthy data, so this approach can also be used with recently comisioned equipment that has not failed yet. Then, using the evolution of the health index, a first faulty point is computed, so two stages are identified in the lifespan of the rotating machinery: healthy and faulty. Correlation matrices are computed to show the relationship of the health index with time-domain and frequency-domain features in order to provide explainability and validate the health index construction process. When the health index is classified as faulty, Dynamic Time Warping is applied between healthy samples and faulty samples to extract differences. Finally, based on a 1/3-binary tree 3 level kurtogram, these differences are filtered using a bandpass filter and converted to the frequency domain, where characteristic harmonics are used to identify the type of bearing fault. The explainability provided in the health index construction process makes the system useful in certain industries where black-box AI models cannot be trusted due to strict regulations. The classification and diagnosis system achieves robustness in fault classification under different working conditions by utilizing multiple bearing fault datsets. Its ability to be trained using only healthy data and the interpretability offered, makes it suitable for recently installed rotating machinery in real industrial facilities, without requiring qualified staff. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Financial economists have long studied factors related to risk premiums, pricing biases, and diversification impediments. This study examines the relationship between a firm’s commitment to environmental, social, and governance principles (ESGs) and asset market returns. We incorporate an algorithmic protocol to identify three nonobservable but pervasive E, S, and G time-series factors to meet the study’s objectives. The novel factors were tested for information content by constructing a six-factor Fama and French model following the imposition of the isolation and disentanglement algorithm. Realizing that nonlinear relationships characterize models incorporating both observable and nonobservable factors, the Fama and French model statement was estimated using an enhanced shallow-learning neural network. Finally, as a post hoc measure, we integrated explainable AI (XAI) to simplify the machine learning outputs. Our study extends the literature on the disentanglement of investment factors across two dimensions. We first identify new time-series-based E, S, and G factors. Second, we demonstrate how machine learning can be used to model asset returns, considering the complex interconnectedness of sustainability factors. Our approach is further supported by comparing neural-network-estimated E, S, and G weights with London Stock Exchange ESG ratings. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The greatest technological transformation the world has ever seen was brought about by artificial intelligence (AI). It presents significant opportunities for the financial sector to enhance risk management, democratize financial services, ensure consumer protection, and improve customer experience. Modern machine learning models are more accessible than ever, but it has been challenging to create and implement systems that support real-world financial applications, primarily due to their lack of transparency and explainability—both of which are essential for building trustworthy technology. The novelty of this study lies in the development of an explainable AI (XAI) model that not only addresses these transparency concerns but also serves as a tool for policy development in credit risk management. By offering a clear understanding of the underlying factors influencing AI predictions, the proposed model can assist regulators and financial institutions in shaping data-driven policies, ensuring fairness, and enhancing trust. This study proposes an explainable AI model for credit risk management, specifically aimed at quantifying the risks associated with credit borrowing through peer-to-peer lending platforms. The model leverages Shapley values to generate AI predictions based on key explanatory variables. The decision tree and random forest models achieved the highest accuracy levels of 0.89 and 0.93, respectively. The model’s performance was further tested using a larger dataset, where it maintained stable accuracy levels, with the decision tree and random forest models reaching accuracies of 0.90 and 0.93, respectively. To ensure reliable explainable AI (XAI) modeling, these models were chosen due to the binary classification nature of the problem. LIME and SHAP were employed to present the XAI models as both local and global surrogates. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This systematic review, conducted within the PRISMA framework, investigates the disruptive capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in optimising Operations and Maintenance (OM) practices within the building and civil infrastructure domain. Addressing 5 research questions and encompassing 111 studies from 2014 to 2024, our study identifies the multifaceted applications of GNNs across different project stages from data enhancement to operational scenario enhancement. When considering integrated Facilities Management (FM) approaches, GNNs are employed for data enhancement purposes, leveraging techniques such as semantic enrichment of Building Information Modelling (BIM), various data imputation scenarios, and semantic segmentation of point clouds to enhance data quality and completeness. Operational scenarios involve the utilisation of GNN algorithms for anomaly detection, fault classification, system optimisation, and forecasting. Methodological optimisations crucial for GNN feasibility include feature engineering, architecture optimisation to balance complexity and overfitting risk, and the integration of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods to enhance model validity and trust. Physical principles integration through Physics-Informed Graph Neural Networks (PIGNNs) further enhances model explainability and validation. Future research directions focus on data interoperability enhancement, scalability improvements, and explainability enhancements. Automated graph generation and labelling, heterogeneous GNN models, supporting algorithms such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and reinforcement learning are proposed to overcome analysis limitations. Specific workflows targeting building performance-based semantic enrichment, building systems data imputation, and interdependency prediction are proposed in future directions. The review highlights the symbiotic relationship between GNN-based analysis and digital twin data analysis, emphasising the suitability of GNNs in addressing the demands of digital twin data analysis in the building and civil infrastructure domain. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Geopolymer has been identified as a promising family of sustainable construction materials alternative to cement-based materials. However, designing geopolymer utilizing solid wastes is a challenging task given the large variations of solid wastes in their physical and chemical properties. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes a knowledge graph-guided data-driven approach to design geopolymer utilizing solid wastes, aimed at achieving high mechanical properties, low material cost, and low carbon emission, while largely improving material discovery efficiency. The proposed approach seamlessly integrates knowledge graph, machine learning, and multi-objective optimization, and has been utilized to design ultra-high performance geopolymer (UHPG). This approach has two main novelties: (1) The incorporation of knowledge graph imparts geopolymer domain knowledge, making the machine learning model interpretable and compliant with domain knowledge. (2) The consideration of physical and chemical properties of raw materials enables the utilization of various solid wastes. The results show that the proposed approach can reasonably predict geopolymer properties, interpret prediction results, and optimize UHPG design. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Pediatric obesity can drastically heighten the risk of cardiometabolic alterations later in life, with insulin resistance standing as the cornerstone linking adiposity to the increased cardiovascular risk. Puberty has been pointed out as a critical stage after which obesity-associated insulin resistance is more difficult to revert. Timely prediction of insulin resistance in pediatric obesity is therefore vital for mitigating the risk of its associated comorbidities. The construction of effective and robust predictive systems for a complex health outcome like insulin resistance during the early stages of life demands the adoption of longitudinal designs for more causal inferences, and the integration of factors of varying nature involved in its onset. In this work, we propose an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence-based decision support pipeline for early diagnosis of insulin resistance in a longitudinal cohort of 90 children. For that, we leverage multi-omics (genomics and epigenomics) and clinical data from the pre-pubertal stage. Different data layers combinations, pre-processing techniques (missing values, feature selection, class imbalance, etc.), algorithms, training procedures were considered following good practices for Machine Learning. SHapley Additive exPlanations were provided for specialists to understand both the decision-making mechanisms of the system and the impact of the features on each automatic decision, an essential issue in high-risk areas such as this one where system decisions may affect people's lives. The system showed a relevant predictive ability (AUC and G-mean of 0.92). A deep exploration, both at the global and the local level, revealed promising biomarkers of insulin resistance in our population, highlighting classical markers, such as Body Mass Index z-score or leptin/adiponectin ratio, and novel ones such as methylation patterns of relevant genes, such as HDAC4, PTPRN2, MATN2, RASGRF1 and EBF1. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating multi-omics data and following eXplainable Artificial Intelligence trends when building decision support systems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Crop diseases adversely affect agricultural productivity and quality. The primary cause of these diseases is the presence of biotic stresses such as fungi, viruses, and bacteria. Detecting these causes at early stages requires constant monitoring by domain experts. Technological advancements in machine learning and deep learning methods have enabled the automated identification of leaf disease-specific symptoms through image analysis. This paper proposes image-based detection of leaf diseases using various deep learning-based models. The experiment was conducted on the PlantVillage dataset, which consists of 54,305 colour leaf images (healthy and diseased) belonging to 11 crop species categorized into 38 classes. The Inception-ResNet-V2-based model achieved a 10-fold cross-validation accuracy of 0.9991±0.002 outperforming the other deep neural architectures and surpassing the performance of existing models in recent state-of-the-art works. Each underlined model is validated on an independent cohort. The Inception-ResNet-V2-based model achieved the best 10-fold cross-validation accuracy of 0.9535±0.041 and was found statistically significant among other deep learning-based models. However, these deep learning models are considered a black box as their leaf disease predictions are opaque to end users. To address this issue, a local interpretable framework is proposed to mark the superpixels that contribute to identifying leaf disease. These superpixels closely confirmed the annotations of the human expert. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents a novel Deep Learning (DL) framework for cotton plant disease prediction based on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and Copula entropy based-Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm. The suggested framework uses a cotton plant image as input and pre-processes it to produce an image with enhanced contrast. Features are extracted from the leaf images with the ResNet50 CNN model. A crucial pre-processing model known as feature selection helps to improve the effectiveness of image classification by deleting extraneous or irrelevant features. Therefore, the Gray Wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm which is a global search method with potential use in feature selection is employed in this paper. The proposed framework introduces Copula entropy (CE) as an indicator of association to create the GWO's initial population and enhance the GWO feature engineering process. For the GWO initialization procedure, CE has been used to choose the most significant features which substantially improved the quality of the GWO starting population and as a result improved the performance of the proposed CE-based GWO algorithm by 78.57 % faster than the traditional GWO as stated by the time complexity analysis. In addition, Feature importance explanation is determined using XAI layer. The final classification is achieved using Random Forests (RF) classifier which is an ensemble learning approach. According to the experimental results, the suggested model has a classification accuracy of 99 % and a mean squared error of 0.0383. Furthermore, the proposed model has been compared to state-of-the-art algorithms and the results showed that the proposed model has the superiority performance. The proposed model can therefore be used to track a variety of cotton areas to enable faster analysis and response, resulting in higher productivity. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the growing complexity in urban areas, cities have become unprecedentedly intricate systems. This paper aims to develop interpretable machine learning (ML) approaches to unravel the sophisticated associations. In a case study of American urban communities, we apply interpretable ML methods to identify the associations between urban density and multiple health risks. We define urban density from three dimensions of population, built environment, and activity and measure multiple health risks based on categories of physical diseases, mental diseases and health burden. Initially, we conduct cluster analysis to control socioeconomic variables and select study samples. Then we build several ML models of multiple linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and extreme gradient boosting. Interpretable methods, including feature importance, partial dependence plots, individual conditional expectations, and Shapley additive explanations, are used to interpret the models by identifying important factors, non-linear relationships, the interactions between variables. The results show the advantages of interpretable ML methods in efficiency and transparency. Our findings verify that the associations between urban density and multiple health risks are complicated. The similarities and differences between various health risks provide valuable evidence on key factors, thresholds, and pathologic characteristics that can guide the healthy and sustainable development of cities. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The prediction of tunnel boring machine (TBM) performance from the rate of penetration (ROP) point of view has yet to draw a lot of attention since it is one of the main challenges for excavation with TBMs. This study examined six tunnels excavated with TBM to develop predictive models of the ROP estimation using five algorithms: Gradient Boosting (GB), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosting Machine, Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and CatBoost (categorical-features-include-GB). A dataset has been developed, including uniaxial compressive strength (UCS), Rock Type, the distance between planes of weakness (DPW), and thrust force (TF), and contains more than 575 data points for each parameter. The developed models showed that the XGBoost model outperformed the other models, followed by the CatBoost, according to seven different evaluation metrics used to rank the models when the models were modeled with the default values of the algorithm parameters. After tuning the hyperparameters, the GB model outperformed the others, while the other models remained relatively unchanged. By using the overall ranking according to the metrics and considering the parameter tuning time, XGBoost and CatBoost were presented as the two best models. SHAP (Shapley additive explanations: an explainable artificial intelligence tool) values and dependency plots showed that the TF has the highest impact on the ROP, followed by UCS, Rock Type, and DPW. It is concluded that the XGBoost and CatBoost models, with coefficients of determination of 0.9878 and 0.9682, respectively, may be used for estimating the TBM penetration rate for similar rock types. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cruising ride-hailing vehicles exacerbate traffic congestion by generating negative externalities. In contrast, reserved ride-hailing services leverage precise information regarding the departure times and origins-destinations of future trips. Platforms can use this data to dispatch and route drivers more efficiently, thereby reducing the need for cruising. Although previous research has largely concentrated on real-time ride-hailing services, the impact of the built environment on reserved ride-hailing remains unexplored with empirical data. This study integrates multi-source data from Haikou City in China and utilizes the gradient boosting decision tree model, which is an interpretable machine learning approach, to investigate potential relationships between reserved ride-hailing trip demand and the built environment. The rankings of relative importance reveal that factors such as the density of food services, education institutions, accessibility to town centers, and proximity to transportation hubs significantly influence the demand for reserved ride-hailing. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the aforementioned factors exhibit non-linear effects on the demand for reserved ride-hailing. The findings have policy implications for local governments aiming to promote reserved ride-hailing and enhance urban mobility services. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a pivotal force in enhancing productivity across various sectors, with its impact being profoundly felt within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology domains. Despite AI’s rapid adoption, its integration into scientific research faces resistance due to myriad challenges: the opaqueness of AI models, the intricate nature of their implementation, and the issue of data scarcity. In response to these impediments, we introduce SmartCADD, an innovative, open-source virtual screening platform that combines deep learning, computer-aided drug design (CADD), and quantum mechanics methodologies within a user-friendly Python framework. SmartCADD is engineered to streamline the construction of comprehensive virtual screening workflows that incorporate a variety of formerly independent techniques─spanning ADMET property predictions, de novo 2D and 3D pharmacophore modeling, molecular docking, to the integration of explainable AI mechanisms. This manuscript highlights the foundational principles, key functionalities, and the unique integrative approach of SmartCADD. Furthermore, we demonstrate its efficacy through a case study focused on the identification of promising lead compounds for HIV inhibition. By democratizing access to advanced AI and quantum mechanics tools, SmartCADD stands as a catalyst for progress in pharmaceutical research and development, heralding a new era of innovation and efficiency. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The furniture manufacturing sector faces significant challenges in machining composite materials, where quality issues such as delamination can lead to substandard products. This study aims to improve the classification of drilled holes in melamine-faced chipboard using Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to better understand and interpret Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models’ decisions. We evaluated three CNN architectures (VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet101) pretrained on the ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned on our dataset of drilled holes. The data consisted of 8526 images, divided into three categories (Green, Yellow, Red) based on the drill’s condition. We used 5-fold cross-validation for model evaluation and applied LIME and Grad-CAM as XAI techniques to interpret the model decisions. The VGG19 model achieved the highest accuracy of 67.03% and the lowest critical error rate among the evaluated models. LIME and Grad-CAM provided complementary insights into the decision-making process of the model, emphasizing the significance of certain features and regions in the images that influenced the classifications. The integration of XAI techniques with CNN models significantly enhances the interpretability and reliability of automated systems for tool condition monitoring in the wood industry. The VGG19 model, combined with LIME and Grad-CAM, offers a robust solution for classifying drilled holes, ensuring better quality control in manufacturing processes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cyber–physical systems have become critical across industries. They have driven investments in education services to develop well-trained engineers. Education services for cyber–physical systems require the hiring of expert tutors with multidisciplinary knowledge, as well as acquiring expensive facilities/equipment. In response to the challenges posed by the need for the equipment and facilities, a metaverse-based education service that incorporates digital twins has been explored as a solution. However, the issue of recruiting expert tutors who can enhance students’ achievements remains unresolved, making it difficult to effectively cultivate talent. This paper proposes a reference architecture for a learner-centric educational metaverse with an intelligent tutoring framework as its core feature to address these issues. We develop a novel explainable artificial intelligence scheme for multi-class object detection models to assess learners’ achievements within the intelligent tutoring framework. Additionally, a genetic algorithm-based improvement search method is applied to the framework to derive personalized feedback. The proposed metaverse architecture and framework are evaluated through a case study on drone education. The experimental results show that the explainable AI scheme demonstrates an approximately 30% improvement in the explanation accuracy compared to existing methods. The survey results indicate that over 70% of learners significantly improved their skills based on the provided feedback. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Visual inspection tasks often require humans to cooperate with artificial intelligence (AI)-based image classifiers. To enhance this cooperation, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) can highlight those image areas that have contributed to an AI decision. However, the literature on visual cueing suggests that such XAI support might come with costs of its own. To better understand how the benefits and cost of XAI depend on the accuracy of AI classifications and XAI highlights, we conducted two experiments that simulated visual quality control in a chocolate factory. Participants had to decide whether chocolate molds contained faulty bars or not, and were always informed whether the AI had classified the mold as faulty or not. In half of the experiment, they saw additional XAI highlights that justified this classification. While XAI speeded up performance, its effects on error rates were highly dependent on (X)AI accuracy. XAI benefits were observed when the system correctly detected and highlighted the fault, but XAI costs were evident for misplaced highlights that marked an intact area while the actual fault was located elsewhere. Eye movement analyses indicated that participants spent less time searching the rest of the mold and thus looked at the fault less often. However, we also observed large interindividual differences. Taken together, the results suggest that despite its potentials, XAI can discourage people from investing effort into their own information analysis. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study presents a multidisciplinary approach involving Explainable Artificial Intelligence (ExAI) and operational risk management to reduce Non-Technical Losses (NTL) in electricity distribution. It empirically explores how the activities of employees of utility companies contribute to NTL, a phenomenon often overlooked in existing empirical research. An ensemble classification algorithm is used to analyse utility operations data, and the SHAP explainability technique establishes the predictive significance of staff activities for NTL. Subsequently, these staff activities are mapped into risk cells using the BASEL II and III operational risk definitions, and the Three Lines of Defence (3LoD) model is developed for optimizing electricity distribution. The paper makes three original contributions to the literature: first, it empirically links staff operations to NTL; second, it maps NTL causes to Basel II/III operational risk categories; and finally, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, it is the first study to use the 3LoD model for electricity distribution optimization. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) elucidates the decision-making process of complex AI models and is important in building trust in model predictions. XAI explanations themselves require evaluation as to accuracy and reasonableness and in the context of use of the underlying AI model. This review details the evaluation of XAI in cardiac AI applications and has found that, of the studies examined, 37% evaluated XAI quality using literature results, 11% used clinicians as domain-experts, 11% used proxies or statistical analysis, with the remaining 43% not assessing the XAI used at all. We aim to inspire additional studies within healthcare, urging researchers not only to apply XAI methods but to systematically assess the resulting explanations, as a step towards developing trustworthy and safe models. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Net primary productivity (NPP) is a crucial component of the terrestrial carbon cycle and plays a crucial role in assessing ecological security. Although machine learning models have been widely used in research on ecosystem modelling, however, the performance of deep learning models with interpretability in predicting NPP are still very limited. In this study, we developed an interpretable deep learning predictive model to uncover the historical drivers and future changes of NPP in China using remote sensing data, climate data and topography. The results show that more than three quarters (88 %) of China's regional NPP have shown an increasing trend over the past 20 years, with an overall trend of 2.46 gC/m2/yr. This extensive range of dynamic processes is a nonlinear response to climatic conditions and topographic factors. The constructed convolutional neural network (CNN) model showed good predictive skill for historical NPP, and revealed that temperature is the main controlling factor, highlighting its importance in vegetation growth in China. Compared to the historical period (2001–2020), in the context of future climate change, the risk of carbon sinks decreasing in China is highly likely in the imminent near term (2021–2039), especially under high emission scenarios. These results suggest that interpretable deep learning method is a useful tool for revealing vegetation productivity drivers and estimating vegetation productivity under a nonstationary climate background. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Clinician-led quality control into oncological decision-making is crucial for optimising patient care. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques provide data-driven approaches to unravel how clinical variables influence this decision-making. We applied global XAI techniques to examine the impact of key clinical decision-drivers when mapped by a machine learning (ML) model, on the likelihood of receiving different oesophageal cancer (OC) treatment modalities by the multidisciplinary team (MDT). Methods: Retrospective analysis of 893 OC patients managed between 2010 and 2022 at our tertiary unit, used a random forests (RF) classifier to predict four possible treatment pathways as determined by the MDT: neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery (NACT + S), neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery (NACRT + S), surgery-alone, and palliative management. Variable importance and partial dependence (PD) analyses then examined the influence of targeted high-ranking clinical variables within the ML model on treatment decisions as a surrogate model of the MDT decision-making dynamic. Results: Amongst guideline-variables known to determine treatments, such as Tumour-Node-Metastasis (TNM) staging, age also proved highly important to the RF model (16.1 % of total importance) on variable importance analysis. PD subsequently revealed that predicted probabilities for all treatment modalities change significantly after 75 years (p < 0.001). Likelihood of surgery-alone and palliative therapies increased for patients aged 75–85yrs but lowered for NACT/NACRT. Performance status divided patients into two clusters which influenced all predicted outcomes in conjunction with age. Conclusion: XAI techniques delineate the relationship between clinical factors and OC treatment decisions. These techniques identify advanced age as heavily influencing decisions based on our model with a greater role in patients with specific tumour characteristics. This study methodology provides the means for exploring conscious/subconscious bias and interrogating inconsistencies in team-based decision-making within the era of AI-driven decision support. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has become a key technology for non-invasive quality evaluation in various fields, offering detailed insights through spatial and spectral data. Despite its efficacy, the complexity and high cost of HSI systems have hindered their widespread adoption. This study addressed these challenges by exploring deep learning-based hyperspectral image reconstruction from RGB (Red, Green, Blue) images, particularly for agricultural products. Specifically, different hyperspectral reconstruction algorithms, such as Hyperspectral Convolutional Neural Network - Dense (HSCNN-D), High-Resolution Network (HRNET), and Multi-Scale Transformer Plus Plus (MST++), were compared to assess the dry matter content of sweet potatoes. Among the tested reconstruction methods, HRNET demonstrated superior performance, achieving the lowest mean relative absolute error (MRAE) of 0.07, root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.03, and the highest peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 32.28 decibels (dB). Some key features were selected using the genetic algorithm (GA), and their importance was interpreted using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Partial least squares regression (PLSR) models were developed using the RGB, reconstructed, and ground truth (GT) data. The visual and spectra quality of these reconstructed methods was compared with GT data, and predicted maps were generated. The results revealed the prospect of deep learning-based hyperspectral image reconstruction as a cost-effective and efficient quality assessment tool for agricultural and biological applications. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Examining the relationship between streetscape features and road traffic accidents is pivotal for enhancing roadway safety. While previous studies have primarily focused on the influence of street design characteristics, sociodemographic features, and land use features on crash occurrence, the impact of streetscape features on pedestrian crashes has not been thoroughly investigated. Furthermore, while machine learning models demonstrate high accuracy in prediction and are increasingly utilized in traffic safety research, understanding the prediction results poses challenges. To address these gaps, this study extracts streetscape environment characteristics from street view images (SVIs) using a combination of semantic segmentation and object detection deep learning networks. These characteristics are then incorporated into the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, along with a set of control variables, to model the occurrence of pedestrian crashes at intersections. Subsequently, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method is integrated with XGBoost to establish an interpretable framework for exploring the association between pedestrian crash occurrence and the surrounding streetscape built environment. The results are interpreted from global, local, and regional perspectives. The findings indicate that, from a global perspective, traffic volume and commercial land use are significant contributors to pedestrian–vehicle collisions at intersections, while road, person, and vehicle elements extracted from SVIs are associated with higher risks of pedestrian crash onset. At a local level, the XGBoost-SHAP framework enables quantification of features’ local contributions for individual intersections, revealing spatial heterogeneity in factors influencing pedestrian crashes. From a regional perspective, similar intersections can be grouped to define geographical regions, facilitating the formulation of spatially responsive strategies for distinct regions to reduce traffic accidents. This approach can potentially enhance the quality and accuracy of local policy making. These findings underscore the underlying relationship between streetscape-level environmental characteristics and vehicle–pedestrian crashes. The integration of SVIs and deep learning techniques offers a visually descriptive portrayal of the streetscape environment at locations where traffic crashes occur at eye level. The proposed framework not only achieves excellent prediction performance but also enhances understanding of traffic crash occurrences, offering guidance for optimizing traffic accident prevention and treatment programs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) has rapidly become a material of choice in modern construction owing to its favorable properties, such as superior strength, toughness, and durability. Yet, accurate quantification of damage states using appropriate engineering demand parameters (EDPs) remains a significant challenge in the performance-based seismic design (PBSD) of UHPC columns. This gap is especially evident in the scarcity of research focused on the PBSD of UHPC columns. Therefore, this study aims to develop an explainable machine learning (ML) powered predictive model for the drift ratio limit states of UHPC bridge columns across four damage states. To achieve this, a fiber-based numerical model was developed and then validated against large-scale experimental results of UHPC columns tested under reverse cyclic loading. The Latin hypercube sampling method is employed to generate a comprehensive database of UHPC bridge columns (10,000 UHPC columns), considering uncertainties across a spectrum of design factors, including column geometry, material characteristics, reinforcement ratio, and axial load ratio. The drift ratios at the initiation of four damage states are determined using the numerical model. Subsequently, the power of the ML algorithm is leveraged to introduce drift ratio limit states for UHPC columns that capture the onset of four different damage states. The efficacy of the developed model is assessed using a range of statistical metrics, including the composite fitness score, D<inf>X%</inf> metrics, coefficient of determination, root mean squared error (RMSE), normalized RMSE, and mean absolute error, which demonstrated high predictive accuracy of the drift ratio limit states on both the training and unseen or test datasets. Furthermore, a model-agnostic Shapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) is used to explain the output of the model and examine the influence of various design factors on drift ratio across the damage states. Notably, the axial load ratio and aspect ratio are found to be major factors in determining the drift ratios across the damage states. The developed model is deployed into a software tool in order to enable its practical application. Additionally, the implementation of the developed model in the context of PBSD is illustrated through a design example. Furthermore, the study proposed capacity uncertainty parameters to aid the fragility assessment of UHPC columns. Finally, the proposed model, along with capacity uncertainty parameters, is used for the fragility assessment of UHPC columns reinforced with varying steel bar grades. The results demonstrate the less vulnerability of UHPC columns reinforced with higher bar grade, yet the effect of bar grade lessens at severe damage levels. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The rise of digital twin-based operational improvements poses a challenge to protecting industrial cyber-physical systems. It is crucial to safeguard digital twins while disclosing internals, which can create an increased attack surface. However, leveraging digital twins to simulate attacks on physical infrastructure becomes essential for enhancing ICPS cybersecurity resilience. This paper introduces an integrated intelligent defense framework called CyberDefender to study various attacks on digital twin-based ICPS from a four-layer perspective (i.e., digital twin-based industrial cyber-physical systems infrastructure layer, honeynet and software-defined industrial network layer, intelligent security platform layer, and smart industrial application layer). To demonstrate its feasibility, we implemented a proof-of-concept (PoC) solution using open-source tools, including AWS for cloud infrastructure, T-Pot for Honeynet, Mininet for SDN support, ELK tools for data management, and Docker for containerization. This framework utilizes an integrated intelligent approach to enhance intrusion detection and classification capabilities for digital twin-based industrial cyber-physical systems (DT-ICPS). The proposed intrusion detection system (IDS) combines two strategies to improve security. First, we present an innovative approach to identifying essential features using explainable AI and ensemble-based filter feature selection (XAI-EFFS). By using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), we analyze the impact of different variables on predictive outcomes. Secondly, we propose a hybrid GRU-LSTM deep-learning model for detecting and classifying intrusions. We optimize the hyperparameters of the GRU-LSTM model by using a Bayesian optimization algorithm. The proposed method demonstrates excellent performance, outperforming conventional state-of-the-art techniques with an accuracy rate of 98.96%, which is a remarkable improvement. Additionally, it effectively detects zero-day attacks, contributing to digital twin-based ICPS cybersecurity resilience.

These systems possess the capacity to enhance decision-making processes and optimize the results of projects. Nevertheless, it is imperative to conduct a thorough and inclusive examination that incorporates and evaluates the various methodologies employed within this particular discipline, thereby bridging the existing void in research. The current state of research in the field of AI and ML in construction engineering is characterized by a dearth of comprehensive reviews that encompass the wide array of methodologies utilized. Although certain studies have delved into specific facets of this subject, there remains a novelty and research gap in terms of a holistic examination of the topic. The objective of this review is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of AI and ML methodologies in the field of construction engineering, with a specific emphasis on their practical applications, advantages, and constraints. The study also ascertains potential areas for future research and improvement in the domain of Intelligent DSS. This study employed a rigorous approach that involved an extensive review of scholarly literature and empirical investigations from 2001 to June 2023. The findings of the analysis indicate a noticeable increase in the number of research papers focusing on Intelligent DSS within the field of construction engineering during the last twenty years. The field has witnessed the emergence of key research areas, namely the utilization of Internet of Things (IoT), explainable AI, supply chain optimization, sustainable construction practices, and human–machine collaboration. The results of this study hold significant implications for the construction industry. The incorporation of AI and ML techniques within Intelligent DSS can effectively tackle various issues such as cost overruns, project delays, and safety concerns. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - We propose Interpretable Generalized Additive Neural Networks (IGANN), a novel machine learning model that uses gradient boosting and tailored neural networks to obtain high predictive performance while being interpretable to humans. We derive an efficient training algorithm based on the theory of extreme learning machines, that allows reducing the training process to solving a sequence of regularized linear regressions. We analyze the algorithm theoretically, provide insights into the rate of change of so-called shape functions, and show that the computational complexity of the training process scales linearly with the number of samples in the training dataset. We implement IGANN in PyTorch, which allows the model to be trained on graphics processing units (GPUs) to speed up training. We demonstrate favorable results in a variety of numerical experiments and showcase IGANN's value in three real-world case studies for productivity prediction, credit scoring, and criminal recidivism prediction. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Unverified rumor detection recently received considerable academic attention due to the societal impact resulting from this potential misinformation. Previous work in this area mainly focused on textual features using a limited number of data sets and candidate algorithms, and completely disregarded model explainability. This study aims to come up with a more comprehensive social media rumor detection methodology. First, we investigate which machine or deep learning algorithm is best suited to classify tweets into rumors and non-rumors using both textual and structured features. Next, we interpret these rumor detection models with the LIME method and assess the quality of the explanations via fidelity and stability. To ensure the robustness of our methodology, it is benchmarked across the well-known PHEME data sets and two novel data sets, which are made publicly available. The results indicate that machine learners perform best on small data sets, while transformer architectures show the highest predictive accuracy for larger data sets. Unfortunately, these high accuracy transformer models are incompatible with LIME, which results in low fidelity. Moreover, our study shows that all LIME explanations are unstable across folds. Based on these results, we argue to evaluate explanation quality using fidelity and stability before explanation deployment. Our results further demonstrate that apparent model-agnostic explanations such as LIME do not seem to be completely model-agnostic and should be used with caution. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The adoption of sustainable solutions in soil stabilization has piqued the interest of the scientific community due to the potential reduction in carbon footprint. In this regard, the research community has started looking for the alternate sustainable solutions to limit the quantity of conventionally used ecologically unfriendly soil stabilizers like lime and cement by utilizing the agricultural and industrial by-products. The production of conventional soil stabilizers (lime and cement) is extremely energy-intensive and contributes tons of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. In general, evaluating suitability of these additives requires in-lab investigation of soil samples with varying additive concentrations and curing periods, making this approach both resource and time-intensive. Hence, this article proposes a computational framework for accelerated characterization of soil-stabilization by using the coupled experimental-Gaussian process (GP) based machine learning (ML) model. The dataset utilized for constructing the GP models consists of input features such as the stabilizer content (lime and rice husk ash (RHA)), coir fiber content, and curing period (measured in days). The target responses are the strength measures of the stabilized soil, such as unconfined compressive strength (UCS), split tensile strength (STS), and California bearing ratio (CBR). The proposed computational framework is deployed to perform multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA)-based optimization to achieve maximum engineering performance from stabilized soil. The presented study demonstrated that with the optimal dosage of rice husk ash (agricultural by-product), and cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL) treated coir fiber, the requirement for lime dosage may be significantly reduced while maintaining the engineering performance of the soil. The presented computational framework can be extended to any construction practices for ensuring the strategic selection of the control variables for optimizing the desired performance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With increasing electronic medical data and the development of artificial intelligence, clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) assist clinicians in diagnosis and prescription. Traditional knowledge-based CDSSs follow an accumulated medical knowledgebase and a predefined rule system, which clarifies the decision-making process; however, maintenance cost issues exist in the medical data quality control and standardization processes. Non-knowledge-based CDSSs utilize vast amounts of data and algorithms to effectively make decisions; however, the deep learning black-box problem causes unreliable results. EXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)-based CDSSs provide valid rationales and explainable results. These systems ensure trustworthiness and transparency by showing the recommendation and prediction result process using explainable techniques. However, existing systems have limitations, such as the scope of data utilization and the lack of explanatory power of AI models. This study proposes a new XAI-based CDSS framework to address these issues; introduces resources, datasets, and models that can be utilized; and provides a foundation model to support decision-making in various disease domains. Finally, we propose future directions for CDSS technology and highlight societal issues that need to be addressed to emphasize the potential of CDSSs in the future. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Digital Twins have gained attention in various industries by creating virtual replicas of real-world systems through data collection and machine learning. These replicas are used to run simulations, monitor processes, and support decision-making, extracting valuable information to benefit users. Reinforcement learning is a promising machine learning technique to use in Digital Twins, as it relies on a virtual representation of an environment or system to learn an optimal policy for a given task, which is exactly what a Digital Twin provides. Through its self-learning nature, reinforcement learning can not only optimize given tasks but might also find ways to achieve goals that were previously unexplored and, therefore, open up new avenues to tackle tasks like pest and disease detection, crop growth or crop rotation planning. However, while reinforcement learning can benefit many agricultural practices, the explainability of the employed models is frequently disregarded, diminishing its benefits as users fail to build trust in the suggested decisions. Consequently, there is a notable absence of focus on explainable reinforcement learning techniques, indicating a significant area for future development as an industry as vital to many people as the agri-food sector needs to rely on resilient methods and understandable decisions. Explainable AI models contribute to achieving both of these requirements. Therefore, the use of reinforcement learning in agriculture has the potential to open up a variety of reinforcement learning-based Digital Twin applications in agricultural domains. To explore these domains, This review categorises existing research works that employ reinforcement learning techniques in agricultural settings. On the one hand, we examine the application domain and put them into categories accordingly. On the other hand, we group the works by the reinforcement learning method involved to gain an overview of the currently employed models. Through this analysis, the review seeks to provide insights into the state-of-the-art reinforcement learning applications in agriculture. Additionally, we aim to identify gaps and opportunities for future research focusing on potential synergies of reinforcement learning and Digital Twins to tackle agricultural challenges and optimise farming processes, paving the way for more efficient and sustainable farming methodologies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding crop responses to climate change is crucial for ensuring food security. Here, we reviewed ∼230 statistical crop modeling studies for major crops and summarized recent progress in estimating climate change impacts on crop yields. Evidence was strong that increasing temperatures reduce crop yields. A 1 °C warming decreased the yields by 7.5 ± 5.3% (maize), 6.0 ± 3.3% (wheat), 6.8 ± 5.9% (soybean), and 1.2 ±5.2% (rice) across the world, but spatial heterogeneity was noticeable, due partly to asymmetric nonlinear crop responses to temperature (e.g., warming-induced gains in cold regions). Yield responses to precipitation were not consistent across the studies or geographical areas. On average, climate explained 37% of yield variability. We also observed a methodological shift from linear regression to machine learning (e.g., explainable AI and interpretable machine learning), which on average reduced predictve errors by 44%. Furthermore, we discussed the opportunities and challenges facing statistical crop modeling, such as ensemble modeling, physics-informed machine learning, spatiotemporal heterogeneity in crop responses, climate extremes, extrapolation under novel climates, and the confounding from technology, management, CO<inf>2</inf>, and O<inf>3</inf>. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Transit-oriented development (TOD) has great potential to foster vibrant communities through improved access to activities around station areas. Several studies have investigated station area vibrancy and associations with TOD built environment (BE). However, few have considered the nonlinear impacts and varying relationships across station types. Taking Nanjing, China as a case study, we aim to 1) identify types of metro station areas (MSAs) with a “node-place-functionality” model and 2) unravel the nonlinear BE-vibrancy relationships and variations across MSA types. We find that five types best characterize the TOD built environment and present different levels of vibrancy indicated by the Baidu Heat Index. The GBDT (gradient boosting decision tree) models reveal transit accessibility, intersection density and commercial service density as the top three predictors of daytime and nighttime vibrancy, all presenting nonlinear and threshold effects. We also find the predicting power of BE features differs significantly across MSA types. The nuanced analyses provide context-specific planning guidance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Digital twins (DTs) are an emerging digitalization technology with a huge impact on today's innovations in both industry and research. DTs can significantly enhance our society and quality of life through the virtualization of a real-world physical system, providing greater insights about their operations and assets, as well as enhancing their resilience through real-time monitoring and proactive maintenance. DTs also pose significant security risks, as intellectual property is encoded and more accessible, as well as their continued synchronization to their physical counterparts. The rapid proliferation and dynamism of cyber threats in today's digital environments motivate the development of automated and intelligent cyber solutions. Today's industrial transformation relies heavily on artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning (ML) and data-driven technologies that allow machines to perform tasks such as self-monitoring, investigation, diagnosis, future prediction, and decision-making intelligently. However, to effectively employ AI-based models in the context of cybersecurity, human-understandable explanations, and their trustworthiness, are significant factors when making decisions in real-world scenarios. This article provides an extensive study of explainable AI (XAI) based cybersecurity modeling through a taxonomy of AI and XAI methods that can assist security analysts and professionals in comprehending system functions, identifying potential threats and anomalies, and ultimately addressing them in DT environments in an intelligent manner. We discuss how these methods can play a key role in solving contemporary cybersecurity issues in various real-world applications. We conclude this paper by identifying crucial challenges and avenues for further research, as well as directions on how professionals and researchers might approach and model future-generation cybersecurity in this emerging field. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) materials are integral to various industries, from automotive and aerospace to infrastructure and construction. While FRP composite design guidelines have been established, the process of obtaining the desired strength of an FRP composite demands considerable time and resources. Despite recent advancements in Machine Learning (ML) models which are commonly used as predictive models, the inherent 'black box' nature of those models poses challenges in understanding the relationship between input design parameters and output strength of the composite. Moreover, these models do not provide tools to facilitate the designing process of the composite. The current study introduces an explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) framework that will provide understanding for the input–output relationships of the model through SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs). In addition, the framework provides for the first time a designing approach for adjusting the important design parameters to obtain the desired composite strength by the designer through utilizing an explainability technique called Counterfactual (CF). The framework is evaluated through the design of a 14-ply composite, successfully identifying critical design parameters, and specifying necessary adjustments to meet strength requirements. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based medical devices and digital health technologies, including medical sensors, wearable health trackers, telemedicine, mobile health (mHealth), large language models (LLMs), and digital care twins (DCTs), significantly influence the process of clinical decision support systems (CDSS) in healthcare and medical applications. However, given the complexity of medical decisions, it is crucial that results generated by AI tools not only be correct but also carefully evaluated, understandable, and explainable to end-users, especially clinicians. The lack of interpretability in communicating AI clinical decisions can lead to mistrust among decision-makers and a reluctance to use these technologies. Objective: This paper systematically reviews the processes and challenges associated with interpretable machine learning (IML) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) within the healthcare and medical domains. Its main goals are to examine the processes of IML and XAI, their related methods, applications, and the implementation challenges they pose in digital health interventions (DHIs), particularly from a quality control perspective, to help understand and improve communication between AI systems and clinicians. The IML process is categorized into pre-processing interpretability, interpretable modeling, and post-processing interpretability. This paper aims to foster a comprehensive understanding of the significance of a robust interpretability approach in clinical decision support systems (CDSS) by reviewing related experimental results. The goal is to provide future researchers with insights for creating clinician-AI tools that are more communicable in healthcare decision support systems and offer a deeper understanding of their challenges. Methods: Our research questions, eligibility criteria, and primary goals were proved using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline and the PICO (population, intervention, control, and outcomes) method. We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases using sensitive and specific search strings. Subsequently, duplicate papers were removed using EndNote and Covidence. A two-phase selection process was then carried out on Covidence, starting with screening by title and abstract, followed by a full-text appraisal. The Meta Quality Appraisal Tool (MetaQAT) was used to assess the quality and risk of bias. Finally, a standardized data extraction tool was employed for reliable data mining. Results: The searches yielded 2,241 records, from which 555 duplicate papers were removed. During the title and abstract screening step, 958 papers were excluded, and the full-text review step excluded 482 studies. Subsequently, in quality and risk of bias assessment, 172 papers were removed. 74 publications were selected for data extraction, which formed 10 insightful reviews and 64 related experimental studies. Conclusion: The paper provides general definitions of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in the medical domain and introduces a framework for interpretability in clinical decision support systems structured across three levels. It explores XAI-related health applications within each tier of this framework, underpinned by a review of related experimental findings. Furthermore, the paper engages in a detailed discussion of quality assessment tools for evaluating XAI in intelligent health systems. It also presents a step-by-step roadmap for implementing XAI in clinical settings. To direct future research toward bridging current gaps, the paper examines the importance of XAI models from various angles and acknowledges their limitations. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - As an important indicator of the surface quality of workpieces, surface roughness has a great impact on production costs and the quality performance of the finished components. Effective surface roughness prediction can not only increase productivity but also reduce costs. However, the current methods for surface roughness prediction have some limitations. On the one hand, the prediction accuracy of classical experimental and statistical-based surface roughness prediction methods is low. On the other hand, the results of deep learning-based surface roughness prediction methods are uninterpretable due to their black-box learning mechanism. Therefore, this paper presents an ensemble learning with a differential evolution algorithm, applies it to the prediction of surface roughness of abrasive water jet polishing (AWJP), and conducts an interpretability analysis to identify key factors contributing to the prediction accuracy of surface roughness. First, we proposed automatically constructing features by an Evolution Forest algorithm to train the base regression models. The differential evolution algorithm with a simplified encoding mechanism was then used to search for the best weighted-ensemble to integrate the base regression models for obtaining highly accurate prediction results. Extensive experiments have been conducted on AWJP to validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. The results show that the prediction accuracy of our proposed method is higher than the existing machine learning algorithms. In addition, this is the first of its time for the contributions of machining parameters (i.e., features) on surface roughness prediction by using interpretable analysis methods. The analysis results can provide a reference basis for subsequent experiments and studies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years, knowledge graphs (KGs) have been widely applied in various domains for different purposes. The semantic model of KGs can represent knowledge through a hierarchical structure based on classes of entities, their properties, and their relationships. The construction of large KGs can enable the integration of heterogeneous information sources and help Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems be more explainable and interpretable. This systematic review examines a selection of recent publications to understand how KGs are currently being used in eXplainable AI systems. To achieve this goal, we design a framework and divide the use of KGs into four categories: extracting features, extracting relationships, constructing KGs, and KG reasoning. We also identify where KGs are mostly used in eXplainable AI systems (pre-model, in-model, and post-model) according to the aforementioned categories. Based on our analysis, KGs have been mainly used in pre-model XAI for feature and relation extraction. They were also utilised for inference and reasoning in post-model XAI. We found several studies that leveraged KGs to explain the XAI models in the healthcare domain. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Efficient identification and remediation of construction defects are critical for ensuring the quality and success of engineering projects. However, the complexity of construction environments poses challenges to this endeavor. Current research predominantly relies on statistical and causal analyses of defect detection reports, yet these methods are time-consuming and error-prone due to the unstructured nature of such reports. To address this, machine learning techniques have been applied to classify defect texts rapidly and accurately. However, existing studies primarily focus on model performance enhancement, neglecting interpretability and the effect of imbalanced data. This study introduces RF-SMOTE, an oversampling technique based on Random Forest (RF), to address the limitations of traditional methods like SMOTE. Comparative analyses demonstrated the efficacy of RF-SMOTE in mitigating imbalanced data effects. Further, the application of SHAP-based interpretability methods in construction management decision-making was explored, filling gaps in existing research. Contributions include providing interpretable machine learning solutions, discussing the effect of imbalanced data, and proposing SHAP-based application scenarios. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Feature attribution explanation (FAE) method, which reveals the contribution of each input feature to the model's output, is one of the most popular explainable artificial intelligence techniques. To assess the quality of explanations provided by FAE methods, various metrics spanning multiple dimensions have been introduced. However, current FAE approaches often prioritize faithfulness of their explanations, neglecting other crucial aspects. To address this issue, we define the construction of a FAE explainable model as a multi-objective learning problem and propose a framework that simultaneously considers multiple quality metrics during FAE explanation generation. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing FAE methods in terms of faithfulness, sensitivity, and complexity. Moreover, our method has better diversity and the capacity to offer different explanations for different stakeholders.This paper for the Hot-off-the-Press track at GECCO 2024 summarizes the work Ziming Wang, Changwu Huang, Yun Li, and Xin Yao: Multi-objective Feature Attribution Explanation for Explainable Machine Learning published in ACM Transactions on Evolutionary Learning and Optimization [5]. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Mathematical stories have demonstrated the ability to bolster the motivation and interest of students in learning mathematics, thereby exerting a positive influence on their academic performance. However, due to a lack of adequate resources and the desire to engage students in the creation process, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is utilized to generate mathematical stories accompanied by images. This study presents a framework for automatic quality assessment to evaluate the coherence of multimodal text and images generated by GAI, as well as the appropriateness of the stories for different grade levels. The dataset comprises mathematical stories generated by GAI for grades 3, 4, and 5, obtained from an American online learning platform, each story consisting of titles, bodies, and image illustrations generated by GP4, images generated by DALL-E3. Initially, a method is devised based on CLIP model and Mini-GPT4 for extracting multimodal semantic features to establish the relationship between text and images in mathematical stories and their generation parameters. Subsequently, mathematical text features are designed, including nine mathematical text attributes and ten traditional text readability indicators, followed by collinearity feature selection and statistical testing. Finally, five machine learning grade regressor for mathematical stories were trained, and the correlation between these 19 features and grades is explored using genetic algorithm-based factor mining and the interpretable artificial intelligence method SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). To further understand advanced text features, the latest natural language processing (NLP) readability indicators are also integrated into the analysis. Through multimodal features, traditional text readability metrics, and NLP readability indicators, this method introduces a novel approach for automatically assessing the quality of GAI-generated multimodal mathematical stories, providing a tool for grade predictor and shedding light on the factors (Image-text relevance and textual features) influencing the grade level of analyzed stories, thereby offering new insights for leveraging GAI in mathematical education. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Achieving sustainable green building design is essential to reducing our environmental impact and enhancing energy efficiency. Traditional methods often depend heavily on expert knowledge and subjective decisions, posing significant challenges. This research addresses these issues by introducing an innovative framework that integrates building information modeling (BIM), explainable artificial intelligence (AI), and multi-objective optimization. The framework includes three main components: data generation through DesignBuilder simulation, a BO-LGBM (Bayesian optimization–LightGBM) predictive model with LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) for energy prediction and interpretation, and the multi-objective optimization technique AGE-MOEA to address uncertainties. A case study demonstrates the framework’s effectiveness, with the BO-LGBM model achieving high prediction accuracy (R-squared > 93.4%, MAPE < 2.13%) and LIME identifying significant HVAC system features. The AGE-MOEA optimization resulted in a 13.43% improvement in energy consumption, CO<inf>2</inf> emissions, and thermal comfort, with an additional 4.0% optimization gain when incorporating uncertainties. This study enhances the transparency of machine learning predictions and efficiently identifies optimal passive and active design solutions, contributing significantly to sustainable construction practices. Future research should focus on validating its real-world applicability, assessing its generalizability across various building types, and integrating generative design capabilities for automated optimization. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: The extraction of a subset of informative genes is a crucial preprocessing step that not only refines the complexity of expression data but also forms the foundation for accurate classification and prognosis of breast cancer based on histologic grade and molecular insights. Methods: CFS-BFS and CONSISTENCY-BFS stand out as the two most effective gene selection algorithms developed. A groundbreaking 2-Stage Gene Selection (GeS) algorithm has emerged to pinpoint essential genes for accurately predicting breast cancer subtypes. Initially, CFS-BFS eliminates a majority of noisy, inappropriate, and redundant genes, followed by the application of CONSISTENCY-BFS. The 2-Stage Gene Selection strategy enhances the algorithm’s effectiveness, addressing uncertainties present in CFS-BFS. Results: Surprisingly, Hidden Weight Naïve Bayes yields more reliable and precise results when integrated with the 2-Stage Gene Selection approach. Promising outcomes are achieved in terms of recall (87.36%), precision (87.5%), f-score (87.3%), and fallout (7.5%) through the utilisation of six microarray gene expression datasets in the experiment. The top four genes acquired are E2F3, PSMC3IP, GINS1, and PLAGL2. Conclusion: Precision treatments for breast cancer may target GINS1, E2F3, PLAG2, and PSMC3IP. Four genes have a poor prognosis. High E2F3 expression may suggest aggressive breast cancer and treatment resistance. PSMC3IP expression may be linked to worse prognosis owing to its function in cell survival and resistance. Breast cancer with high GINS1 expression is more aggressive and has a poorer prognosis. Cell proliferation and tumour growth may increase with GINS1 expression. PLAGL2 has both oncogenic and tumor-suppressive roles in breast cancer genesis and progression. Explainable AI (XAI) in breast cancer enhances patient comprehension, guarantees quality control, finds critical aspects for diagnosis and therapy, and complies with regulatory standards. Significant genes standing in breast cancer is determined through validation using permutation importance and SHAP values. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Analysis of structures contained in tissue samples and the relevant contextual information is of utmost importance to histopathologists during diagnosis. Cardiac biopsies require in-depth analysis of the relationships between biological structures. Statistical measures are insufficient for determining a model's viability and applicability in the diagnostic process. A deeper understanding of predictions is necessary in order to support histopathologists. Methods: We propose a method for providing supporting information in the form of segmentation of histological structures to histopathologists based on these principles. The proposed method utilizes nuclei type and density information in addition to standard image input provided at two different zoom levels for the semantic segmentation of blood vessels, inflammation, and endocardium in heart tissue. Results: The proposed method was able to reach state-of-the-art segmentation results. The overall quality and viability of the predictions was qualitatively evaluated by two pathologists and a histotechnologist. Conclusions: The decision process of the proposed deep learning model utilizes the provided information sources correctly and simulates the decision process of histopathologists via the usage of a custom-designed attention gate that provides a combination of spatial and encoder attention mechanisms.

AB  - The Deep Learning (DL) models stand out as one of the most popular and widely adopted machine learning techniques across various applications, owing to their capability to handle extensive datasets and extract complex features. However, despite its widespread usage, there are concerns regarding the interpretability and explainability of the DL model, especially if the applications are related to healthcare, where trust is paramount. To address this issue, we have proposed a linguistic rule-based explainable artificial intelligence (LR-XAI) model designed to elucidate the decision-making process of DL models in terms of rules. This LR-XAI model employs various local-level interpretation methods to analyze the different features learned during training, and a linguistic rule-based system is subsequently utilized to generate rules based on these interpretation scores. The proposed model aims to enhance both interpretability in terms of feature attributions score and explainability in terms of IF-THEN rules. We evaluated the proposed model on three diverse datasets related to the physics experiments, and custom datasets. Furthermore, we conducted a statistical analysis to rigorously compare the rules generated by different interpretation models. This critical step is paramount for a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of the quality of rules. The results of these evaluations provide valuable insights into the effectiveness and applicability of our proposed model in addressing the interpretability and explainability challenges associated with DL models. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Data-driven modeling using Artificial Intelligence (AI) is envisioned as a key enabling technology for Zero Touch Network (ZTN) management. Specifically, AI has shown huge potential for automating and modeling the threat detection mechanism of complicated wireless systems. The current data-driven AI systems, however, lack transparency and accountability in their decisions, and assuring the reliability and trustworthiness of the data collected from participating entities is an important obstacle to threat detection and decision-making. To this end, we integrate smart contracts with eXplainable AI (XAI) to design a robust cybersecurity framework for ZTN. The proposed framework uses a blockchain and smart contract-enabled access control and authentication mechanism to ensure trust among the participating entities. Additionally, with the collected data, we designed Digital Twins (DTs) for simulating the attack detection operation in the ZTN environment. Specifically, to provide a platform for analysis and the development of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), the DTs are equipped with a variety of process-aware attack scenarios. A Self Attention-based Long Short Term Memory (SALSTM) network is used to evaluate the attack detection capabilities of the proposed framework. Furthermore, the explainability of the proposed AI-based IDS is achieved using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) tool. The experimental results using N-BaIoT and a self-generated DTs dataset confirm the superiority of the proposed framework over some baseline and state-of-the-art techniques. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Exploring and analyzing safety influencing factors can guide targeted traffic safety management. Traditional traffic safety models are aimed at specific data problems and making adjustments to the model structure, which lack focus on predictive ability and have limited information on the analysis of influencing factors. In recent years, machine-learning methods have opened new avenues in modeling that have higher prediction accuracy, can identify complex nonlinear relationships, and can overcome over- and under-dispersion and correlation. Machine-learning methods, however, pose the problem of limited interpretability. The interpretable machine-learning framework SHAP can be an effective solution, which can not only reflect the influence of features in each sample but also generate global interpretation. This study established gradient boosting models including the CatBoost and XGBoost models as traffic safety models, which were compared with a traditional NB regression model and a zero-inflated negative binomial regression model. SHAP was used to analyze several safety influencing factors, including geometric design features, traffic operation characteristics, time of day, and land use. Results confirmed that the CatBoost model has better prediction ability and is a more suitable traffic safety model than the traditional negative binomial regression model. Among the key findings were that ramp type is the most important factor in freeway crash frequency; curve presence has a great positive impact, while truck proportion has a great negative impact; and traffic volume is highly correlated with truck proportion. These findings can provide theoretical support for safety operation management and targeted improvement measures for freeways. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Artificial intelligence-enabled business models aim to improve decision-making, operational efficiency, innovation, and productivity. The presented systematic literature review is conducted to highlight elucidating the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) methods and techniques within AI-enabled businesses, the significance and functions of AI-enabled organizational models and frameworks, and the design parameters employed in academic research studies within the AI-enabled business domain. We reviewed 39 empirical studies that were published between 2010 and 2023. The studies that were chosen are classified based on the artificial intelligence business technique, empirical research design, and SLR search protocol criteria. According to the findings, machine learning and artificial intelligence were reported as popular methods used for business process modelling in 19% of the studies. Healthcare was the most experimented business domain used for empirical evaluation in 28% of the primary research. The most common reason for using artificial intelligence in businesses was to improve business intelligence. 51% of main studies claimed to have been carried out as experiments. 53% of the research followed experimental guidelines and were repeatable. For the design of business process modelling, eighteen AI mythology were discovered, as well as seven types of AI modelling goals and principles for organisations. For AI-enabled business models, safety, security, and privacy are key concerns in society. The growth of AI is influencing novel forms of business. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - For the diagnosis task of key components of complex rotating machinery, the design of the diagnosis model is easily constrained by the following two characteristics：① Mechanism-driven methods are often hard to accomplish complete and accurate modelling of complex systems；② Data-driven approaches often require large-scale and high-quality data for training. To solve the above problems, a deep learning model with prior knowledge embedding is proposed to fuse prior knowledge from the mechanism and features of sensor signals. By introducing lightweight model structures, the inference delay of the model is reduced while ensuring its accuracy. Firstly, the digital twin model of key components is constructed by fusing the prior mechanism knowledge and sensor signal features. Secondly, a prior knowledge embedding module is designed to enhance the representation ability of the deep learning model for fused features. Finally, a multi-objective optimization method considering both accuracy and computing efficiency metrics is designed based on the Pareto-optimal theorem. An interpretable framework is introduced to analyse the decision-making process of the deep learning model. The results indicate that the designed digital twin of key components can provide rich prior knowledge to accelerate the convergence of the model. The training strategy based on the Pareto-optimal theorem can find the optimal solution according to settled metrics. The optimization can effectively reduce the inference latency while ensuring recognition performance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The construction of community elderly care facilities (CECF) is pivotal for promoting healthy aging and “aging in place” for older people. This study focuses on the low utilization rates of community elderly care facilities in the Dongcheng and Xicheng Districts, core areas of Beijing. The explainable machine learning method is used to analyze data across three dimensions: the elderly’s individual attributes, characteristics of the community elderly care station (CECS), and features of the built environment around CECS and subdistrict, to identify the important factors that influence the usage frequency of overall CECS and its different functional spaces, and also the correlation between factors and usage frequency of CECS. It shows that the most important factors are the features of CSCF, including the degree of space acceptance and satisfaction with services provided, which influence the usage frequency of nine functional spaces (R2 ≥ 0.68) and overall (R2 = 0.56). In addition, older people’s individual factors, such as age and physical condition, significantly influence the usage of specific spaces such as rehabilitation therapy rooms and assistive bathing rooms. The influence of built environment characteristics is relatively low, with factors such as the density of bus stations and housing prices within the subdistrict and the mean distance from CECF to the nearest subway stations being more important. These findings provide a reference for the construction of indoor environments, management of service quality, and optimal site selection for future community elderly care facilities. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Early detection of plant nutrient deficiency is crucial for agricultural productivity. This study investigated the performance and interpretability of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for this task. Using the rice and banana datasets, we compared three CNN architectures (CNN, VGG-16, Inception-V3). Inception-V3 achieved the highest accuracy (93% for rice and banana), but simpler models such as VGG-16 might be easier to understand. To address this trade-off, we employed Explainable AI (XAI) techniques (SHAP and Grad-CAM) to gain insights into model decision-making. This study emphasises the importance of both accuracy and interpretability in agricultural AI and demonstrates the value of XAI for building trust in these models. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - South Korea’s Particulate Matter (PM) concentration is among the highest among Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) member countries. However, many studies in South Korea primarily focus on housing characteristics and the physical built environment when estimating apartment prices, often neglecting environmental factors. This study investigated factors influencing apartment prices using transaction data for Seoul apartments provided by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport (MOLIT) in 2019. For this purpose, the study compared and analyzed a traditional hedonic price model with a machine learning-based random forest model. The main findings are as follows: First, the evaluation results of the traditional hedonic price model and the machine learning-based random forest model indicated that the random forest model was found to be more suitable for predicting apartment prices. Second, an importance analysis using Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) showed that PM is more important in determining apartment prices than access to education and bus stops, which were considered in this study. Finally, the study found that areas with higher concentrations of PM tend to have higher apartment prices. Therefore, when proposing policies to stabilize apartment prices, it is essential to consider environmental factors. Furthermore, it is necessary to devise measures such as assigning PM labels to apartments during the home purchasing process, enabling buyers to consider PM and obtain relevant information accordingly. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Machine learning algorithms in non-linear pattern recognition for defect detection in manufacturing processes are increasingly prevalent in the context of Industry 4.0. This scenario enables factories to develop methodologies for monitoring and controlling the quality of their products, obtaining better operational efficiency indicators, and offering increasingly competitive products in the market. Explainable Artificial Intelligence can facilitate understanding how the models make decisions and assist in tracking anomaly points. This paper proposes an explainability framework for machine learning models in defect detection. This work applied the multinational industry's approach to the tire manufacturing process. Models such as random forest, gradient boosting decision tree, light gradient boosting machine, logistic regression, support vector machine, and multi-layer perceptron were considered to evaluate the performance of tires in compliance with production standards. Statistical methodologies had to be adopted to deal with the small number of samples training the machine learning models. The random forest and logistic regression models achieved the best performances with an accuracy of 92% and 96%, respectively. The Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations and SHapley Additive exPlanations methods were used to identify the relevant process variables. The approach presents the global and local interpretations of the results, allowing for a deeper understanding of how process variables discriminate the fault. The proposed framework determines reference values for each selected process variable for tire manufacturing in compliance with quality standards. This approach provides a relevant tool for quality control management in tire manufacturing industries. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - During the initial stages of engineering projects management, the accurate estimation of equipment costs plays a crucial role in determining project approval decisions. However, there is a significant research gap regarding the estimation of investment costs for water reuse equipment. Additionally, cost predictions for such construction projects often suffer from limitations, including low accuracy, limited generalizability, and inefficiency. Advanced machine learning (ML) methods, renowned for their ability to model complex decision-making processes, offer powerful solutions. In this study, four traditional models and four ensemble models were employed to predict the cost of water reuse equipment. The results demonstrated that the ensemble models exhibited significantly superior predictive performance to that of traditional models with the three boosting ensemble models achieving the best performance (traditional models: training R2 = 29.77 %–94.85 %, testing R2 = 30.62 %–71.72 %; boosting ensemble models: training R2 = 97.42 %, testing R2 = 82.16 %–93.79 %). Furthermore, this study simplified the features of predictive models and identified the key variables that influence the cost of water reuse equipment using Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) method. The retrained ensemble models re-constructed based on the selected variables achieved significant predictive performance, with the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) outperforming the other models (training set R2 = 97.37 %, testing set R2 = 93.86 %). The water quantity, inflow conductivity, outflow conductivity, and recovery rate emerged as critical factors affecting the cost of water reuse equipment. Overall, the methods proposed in this study can enhance the versatility of cost prediction processes in environmental engineering scenarios, particularly those concerning the construction costs of water treatment equipment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite the recognized potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to improve governance, a significant divide in AI adoption exists among governments globally. However, little is known about the underlying causes behind the divide, hindering effective strategies to bridge it. Drawing on the AI capability concept and the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework, this study employs Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) models to analyze the multifaceted factors influencing AI adoption by governments worldwide. The results underscore the critical roles of internet security and internet usage within the technological dimension, regulatory quality, government effectiveness, government expenditure, rule of law, and corruption control within the organizational dimension, and globalization, median age and GDP per capita within the environmental dimension. Notably, our analysis explores the intricate effects of these variables on government AI adoption, identifying inflection points where their impacts undergo significant shifts in magnitude and direction. This nuanced exploration provides a comprehensive understanding of government AI adoption globally and illustrates targeted strategies for governments to bridge the AI adoption divide, making theoretical, methodological and practical implications. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Data-driven constitutive modeling with neural networks has received increased interest in recent years due to its ability to easily incorporate physical and mechanistic constraints and to overcome the challenging and time-consuming task of formulating phenomenological constitutive laws that can accurately capture the observed material response. However, even though neural network-based constitutive laws have been shown to generalize proficiently, the generated representations are not easily interpretable due to their high number of trainable parameters. Sparse regression approaches exist that allow for obtaining interpretable expressions, but the user is tasked with creating a library of model forms which by construction limits their expressiveness to the functional forms provided in the libraries. In this work, we propose to train regularized physics-augmented neural network-based constitutive models utilizing a smoothed version of L0-regularization. This aims to maintain the trustworthiness inherited by the physical constraints, but also enables interpretability which has not been possible thus far on any type of machine learning-based constitutive model where model forms were not assumed a priori but were actually discovered. During the training process, the network simultaneously fits the training data and penalizes the number of active parameters, while also ensuring constitutive constraints such as thermodynamic consistency. We show that the method can reliably obtain interpretable and trustworthy constitutive models for compressible and incompressible hyperelasticity, yield functions, and hardening models for elastoplasticity, using synthetic and experimental data. This work aims to set a new paradigm for interpretable machine learning models in the broad area of solid mechanics where low and limited data is available along with prior knowledge of physical constraints that the learned maps need to obey. This paradigm can potentially be extended to a broader spectrum of scientific exploration. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Fibre reinforced polymers (FRP) are widely used for the strengthening of beams, slabs and columns due to their light weight and high strength. Compared to the traditional methods like steel cages or steel jackets, it reduces the time and economic cost significantly. This study focuses on the prediction of the compressive strength of FRP-confined concrete columns, which is influenced by multiple parameters. Initially, through experimental observations and the analysis of parameter mechanisms, the key parameters affecting compressive strength were identified. Six prediction models, namely linear regression, ridge regression, decision tree, random forest, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting, were subsequently constructed and evaluated to determine the optimal machine learning model. A comparison between the machine learning models and mathematical models was conducted. Furthermore, SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) analysis was performed to ascertain the parameter importance and sensitivity of the machine learning model, and the analysis results were compared with existing models. The results indicate that compared to other machine learning and mathematical models, the eXtreme Gradient Boosting model demonstrates superior robustness and accuracy. The thickness and elastic modulus of FRP, as well as the concrete strength, are identified as crucial parameters that positively influence compressive strength. The relationships between the former two parameters and compressive strength follow a logarithmic function, while the relationship between concrete strength and compressive strength is approximately linear. These findings hold implications for the future development of codes and standards. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This groundbreaking study introduces a novel approach employing Extreme Fine-Tuning (XFT) combined with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) for the accurate, non destructive prediction of concrete compressive strength. By analyzing a state-of-the-art dataset containing 18,480 data points, this study developed a deep neural network that, through extensive hyperparameter optimization, achieves unprecedented prediction accuracy of approximately 98.7%. The novelty of this research lies in the sophisticated integration of XFT and XAI techniques, which not only significantly enhances prediction accuracy but also provides insightful explanations of the model's decision-making process, shedding light on the factors influencing concrete strength. This dual focus on accuracy and explainability represents a significant advancement in the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in material science and civil engineering, offering a powerful tool for researchers and practitioners. This study culminates in a model that outperforms existing methodologies in predicting concrete compressive strength, with an accuracy superior to 98.5% in both instances, testing and validation. By integrating XAI into this approach, we have also opened new avenues for understanding the complex relationships between concrete composition and its mechanical properties. This study marks a substantial step forward in the non-destructive evaluation of construction materials. It sets a new benchmark for transparency and interpretability in AI models within the engineering domain. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training of machine learning models across distributed medical data sources without compromising privacy. However, applying FL to medical image analysis presents challenges like high communication overhead and data heterogeneity. This paper proposes novel FL techniques using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for efficient, accurate, and trustworthy analysis. A heterogeneity-aware causal learning approach selectively sparsifies model weights based on their causal contributions, significantly reducing communication requirements while retaining performance and improving interpretability. Furthermore, blockchain provides decentralized quality assessment of client datasets. The assessment scores adjust aggregation weights so higher-quality data has more influence during training, improving model generalization. Comprehensive experiments show our XAI-integrated FL framework enhances efficiency, accuracy and interpretability. The causal learning method decreases communication overhead while maintaining segmentation accuracy. The blockchain-based data valuation mitigates issues from low-quality local datasets. Our framework provides essential model explanations and trust mechanisms, making FL viable for clinical adoption in medical image analysis. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Deep learning models are extensively used but often lack transparency due to their complex internal mechanics. To bridge this gap, the field of explainable AI (XAI) strives to make these models more interpretable. However, a significant obstacle in XAI is the absence of quantifiable metrics for evaluating explanation quality. Existing techniques, reliant on manual assessment or inadequate metrics, face limitations in scalability, reproducibility, and trustworthiness. Recognizing these issues, the current study specifically addresses the quality assessment of visual explanations in medical imaging, where interpretability profoundly influences diagnostic accuracy and trust in AI-assisted decisions. Introducing novel criteria such as informativeness, localization, coverage, multi-target capturing, and proportionality, this work presents a comprehensive method for the objective assessment of various explainability algorithms. These newly introduced criteria aid in identifying optimal evaluation metrics. The study expands the domain’s analytical toolkit by examining existing metrics, which have been prevalent in recent works for similar applications, and proposing new ones. Rigorous analysis led to selecting Jensen–Shannon divergence (JS_DIV) as the most effective metric for visual explanation quality. Applied to the multi-label, multi-class diagnosis of thoracic diseases using a trained classifier on the CheXpert dataset, local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) with diverse segmentation strategies interpret the classifier’s decisions. A qualitative analysis on an unseen subset of the VinDr-CXR dataset evaluates these metrics, confirming JS_DIV’s superiority. The subsequent quantitative analysis optimizes LIME’s hyper-parameters and benchmarks its performance across various segmentation algorithms, underscoring the utility of an objective assessment metric in practical applications. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Debris flow has always been a serious problem in mountainous areas. Accurate debris flow susceptibility (DFS) assessment and interpretable prediction results play an important role in the prevention and control of debris flow disasters. Some commonly used machine learning algorithms based on Boosting ensemble techniques were widely used in the study of geohazard susceptibility due to its excellent predictive ability. However, the Categorical Boosting (CatBoost) and Natural Gradient Boosting (NGBoost) have not yet been applied in the field of DFS assessment, and few geohazard studies systematically compare and research these boosting-based algorithms. Meanwhile, previous researches have mostly focused on comparing the predictive ability of algorithms, identifying the susceptibility zones of the entire study area, and ranking the importance of the indicators, but little thorough analysis of the relationship between the indicators and debris flow susceptibility on different types of construction land. The aims of this study were to explore the optimal boosting-based DFS model, and the distribution characteristics and change rules of DFS in the study area, so as to provide decision supports for debris flow disaster prevention and reduction. This was the first time that six boosting-based machine learning algorithms have been compared in the study of DFS assessment. After determining the optimal model, the change rules of indicators in the entire study area and two types of construction lands under different DFS levels were studied respectively. An eXplainable Artifcial Intelligence (XAI) method called SHapley Additive exPlantations (SHAP), combined with zonal statistics function in geographic information system (GIS) were adopted to explore how each indicator affects the occurrence of debris flows. The results showed that the CatBoost performed best and provided the most reasonable DFS result among six boosting-based models. We found that debris flows were more likely to occur along rivers and construction lands at low altitude. Rural areas faced more stronger pressure from rainfall and were featured by worse disaster-breeding environment than urban areas. This research enriches the application of machine learning in DFS assessment, explores the changing trends of indicators between different DFS levels, and provides suggestions for better debris flow disaster prevention and mitigation management. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - New technologies, such as machine learning (ML), have provided great potential for evaluating industry workflows and automatically generating key performance indicators (KPIs). However, despite established standards for measuring the efficiency of industrial machinery, there is no precise equivalent for workers' productivity, which would be highly desirable given the lack of a skilled workforce for the next generation of industry workflows. Therefore, an ML solution combining data from manufacturing processes and workers' performance for that goal is required. Additionally, in recent times intense effort has been devoted to explainable ML approaches that can automatically explain their decisions to a human operator, thus increasing their trustworthiness. We propose to apply explainable ML solutions to differentiate between expert and inexpert workers in industrial workflows, which we validate at a quality assessment industrial workstation. Regarding the methodology used, input data are captured by a manufacturing machine and stored in a NoSQL database. Data are processed to engineer features used in automatic classification and to compute workers' KPIs to predict their level of expertise (with all classification metrics exceeding 90%). These KPIs and the relevant features in the decisions are textually explained by natural language expansion on an explainability dashboard. These automatic explanations made it possible to infer knowledge from expert workers for inexpert workers. The latter illustrates the interest of research in self-explainable ML for automatically generating insights to improve productivity in industrial workflows. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Digitalization and technologization affect numerous domains, promising advantages but also entailing risks. Hence, when decision-makers in highly-regulated domains like Finance implement these technological advances—especially Artificial Intelligence—regulators prescribe high levels of transparency, assuring the traceability of decisions for third parties. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is of tremendous importance in this context. We provide an overview of current research on XAI in Finance with a systematic literature review screening 2,022 articles from leading Finance, Information Systems, and Computer Science outlets. We identify a set of 60 relevant articles, classify them according to the used XAI methods and goals that they aim to achieve, and provide an overview of XAI methods used in different Finance areas. Areas like risk management, portfolio optimization, and applications around the stock market are well-researched, while anti-money laundering is understudied. Researchers implement both transparent models and post-hoc explainability, while they recently favored the latter. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Detecting botnets is an essential task to ensure the security of Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Machine learning (ML)-based approaches have been widely used for this purpose, but the lack of interpretability and transparency of the models often limits their effectiveness. In this research paper, our aim is to improve the transparency and interpretability of high-performance ML models for IoT botnet detection by selecting higher quality explanations using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques. We used three data sets to induce binary and multiclass classification models for IoT botnet detection, with sequential backward selection (SBS) employed as the feature selection technique. We then use two post hoc XAI techniques such as local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) and Shapley additive explanation (SHAP), to explain the behavior of the models. To evaluate the quality of explanations generated by XAI methods, we employed faithfulness, monotonicity, complexity, and sensitivity metrics. ML models employed in this work achieve very high detection rates with a limited number of features. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of XAI methods in improving the interpretability and transparency of ML-based IoT botnet detection models. Specifically, explanations generated by applying LIME and SHAP to the extreme gradient boosting model yield high faithfulness, high consistency, low complexity, and low sensitivity. Furthermore, SHAP outperforms LIME by achieving better results in these metrics. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Explaining stock predictions is generally a difficult task for traditional non-generative deep learning models, where explanations are limited to visualizing the attention weights on important texts. Today, Large Language Models (LLMs) present a solution to this problem, given their known capabilities to generate human-readable explanations for their decision-making process. However, the task of stock prediction remains challenging for LLMs, as it requires the ability to weigh the varying impacts of chaotic social texts on stock prices. The problem gets progressively harder with the introduction of the explanation component, which requires LLMs to explain verbally why certain factors are more important than the others. On the other hand, to fine-tune LLMs for such a task, one would need expert-annotated samples of explanation for every stock movement in the training set, which is expensive and impractical to scale. To tackle these issues, we propose our Summarize-Explain-Predict (SEP) framework, which utilizes a verbal self-reflective agent and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) that allow a LLM teach itself how to generate explainable stock predictions, in a fully autonomous manner. The reflective agent learns how to explain past stock movements through a self-reasoning process, while the PPO trainer trains the model to generate the most likely explanations given the input texts at test-time. The training samples for the PPO trainer are also the responses generated during the reflective process, which eliminates the need for human annotators. Using our SEP framework, we fine-tune a specialized LLM that can outperform both traditional deep-learning and LLM methods in prediction accuracy and Matthews correlation coefficient, for the stock classification task. To justify the generalization capability of our framework, we further test it on the portfolio construction task, and demonstrate its effectiveness through various portfolio metrics.

AB  - In the field of recommender systems, explainability remains a pivotal yet challenging aspect. To address this, we introduce the Learning to eXplain Recommendations (LXR) framework, a post-hoc, model-agnostic approach designed for providing counterfactual explanations. LXR is compatible with any differentiable recommender algorithm and scores the relevance of user data in relation to recommended items. A distinctive feature of LXR is its use of novel self-supervised counterfactual loss terms, which effectively highlight the most influential user data responsible for a specific recommended item. Additionally, we propose several innovative counterfactual evaluation metrics specifically tailored for assessing the quality of explanations in recommender systems. Our code is available on our GitHub repository: https://github.com/DeltaLabTLV/LXR. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In predictive maintenance, the complexity of the data often requires the use of Deep Learning models. These models, called”black boxes”, have proved their worth in predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of industrial machines . However, the inherent opacity of these models requires the incorporation of post-hoc explanation methods to enhance transparency. The quality of the explanations provided is then assessed using so-called evaluation metrics. Modeling is a whole process that includes an important data preprocessing phase, with parameter selection such as time window, smoothing parameter, or rectified RUL when dealing with multivariate time series dataset. We propose to analyze the impact of these preprocessing methods on the quality of explanations provided by the local post-hoc models LIME, KernelSHAP, and L2X, utilizing six evaluation metrics: stability, consistency, congruence, selectivity, completeness, and acumen. This analysis will be based on NASA’s Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (C-MAPSS) dataset with the LSTM model. Our findings reveal that the choice of specific pre-processing parameters can significantly improve predictive performance. Furthermore, the quality of explanations depends on the selection of explicability methods. In addition, a factorial analysis of the evaluation metrics reveals that they do not all point in the same direction. Indeed, understanding the nuanced relationships between evaluation metrics is essential for a comprehensive and accurate assessment of explainability methods. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Automatic detection of tire defects has become an important issue for tire production companies since these defects cause road accidents and loss of human lives. Defects in the inner structure of the tire cannot be detected with the naked eye; thus, a radiographic image of the tire is gathered using X-ray cameras. This image is then examined by a quality control operator, and a decision is made on whether it is a defective tire or not. Among all defect types, the foreign object type is the most common and may occur anywhere in the tire. This study proposes an explainable deep learning model based on Xception and Grad-CAM approaches. This model was fine-tuned and trained on a novel real tire dataset consisting of 2303 defective tires and 49,198 non-defective. The defective tire class was augmented using a custom augmentation technique to solve the imbalance problem of the dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed model detects foreign objects with an accuracy of 99.19%, recall of 98.75%, precision of 99.34%, and f-score of 99.05%. This study provided a clear advantage over similar literature studies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the flourishing development of corpus linguistics and technological revolutions in the AI-powered age, automated essay scoring (AES) models have been intensively developed. However, the intricate relationship between linguistic features and different constructs of writing quality has yet to be thoroughly investigated. The present study harnessed computational analytic tools and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to distill and refine linguistic indicators for model construction. Findings revealed that both micro-features and their combination with aggregated features robustly described writing quality over aggregated features alone. Linear and non-linear models were thus developed to explore the associations between linguistic features and different constructs of writing quality. The non-linear AES model with Random Forest Regression demonstrated superior performance over other benchmark models. Furthermore, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was employed to pinpoint the most powerful linguistic features for each rating trait, enhancing the model’s transparency through explainable AI (XAI). These insights hold the potential to substantially facilitate the advancement of multi-dimensional approaches toward writing assessment and instruction. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The rapid urbanization of Abha and its surrounding cities in Saudi Arabia’s mountainous regions poses challenges for sustainable and secure development. This study aimed to identify suitable sites for eco-friendly and safe building complexes amidst complex geophysical, geoecological, and socio-economic factors, integrating natural hazards assessment and risk management. Employing the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (Fuzzy-AHP), the study constructed a suitability model incorporating sixteen parameters. Additionally, a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based on eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) conducted sensitivity analyses to assess the parameters’ influence on optimal location decision making. The results reveal slope as the most crucial parameter (22.90%), followed by altitude and land use/land cover (13.24%), emphasizing topography and environmental considerations. Drainage density (11.36%) and rainfall patterns (9.15%) are also significant for flood defense and water management. Only 12.21% of the study area is deemed “highly suitable”, with “no-build zones” designated for safety and environmental protection. DNN-based XAI demonstrates the positive impact of variables like the NDVI and municipal solid waste generation on site selection, informing waste management and ecological preservation strategies. This integrated methodology provides actionable insights for sustainable and safe residential development in Abha, aiding informed decision making and balancing urban expansion with environmental conservation and hazard risk reduction. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - For over a century, induction furnaces have been used in the core of foundries for metal melting and heating. They provide high melting/heating rates with optimal efficiency. The occurrence of faults not only imposes safety risks but also reduces productivity due to unscheduled shutdowns. The problem of diagnosing faults in induction furnaces has not yet been studied, and this work is the first to propose a data-driven framework for diagnosing faults in this application. This paper presents a deep neural network framework for diagnosing electrical faults by measuring real-time electrical parameters at the supply side. Experimental and sensory measurements are collected from multiple energy analyzer devices installed in the foundry. Next, a semi-supervised learning approach, known as the local outlier factor, has been used to discriminate normal and faulty samples from each other and label the data samples. Then, a deep neural network is trained with the collected labeled samples. The performance of the developed model is compared with several state-of-the-art techniques in terms of various performance metrics. The results demonstrate the superior performance of the selected deep neural network model over other classifiers, with an average F-measure of 0.9187. Due to the black box nature of the constructed neural network, the model predictions are interpreted by Shapley additive explanations and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations. The interpretability analysis reveals that classified faults are closely linked to variations in odd voltage/current harmonics of order 3, 11, 13, and 17, highlighting the critical impact of these parameters on the model’s prediction. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The precise prediction of tunnel convergence holds significant importance in ensuring the safety and efficiency of tunnel construction. This study involves the construction of seven machine learning (ML) models that are deemed reliable for predicting crown convergence (CC) of plateau mountain tunnels. These models include K-nearest neighbour (KNN), support vector regression (SVR), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), categorical boosting (CatBoost), and automated machine learning model (Auto-ML). The Bayesian optimization (BO) technique and the Tree-based pipeline optimization tool (TPOT) were employed to optimize the hyperparameters of non-automated machine learning models and the automated machine learning model, separately. A total of 2,734 samples of crown convergence monitoring data were collected for training and testing the models. The evaluation metrics employed to assess the performance of the models’ predictions included the determination coefficient (R2), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE). The XGBoost model demonstrated the best prediction performance with the R2, MAPE, MAE, and RMSE of 0.9887, 0.1271, 0.7759, and 1.1845 on test set. The XGBoost, CatBoost, and Auto-ML models were utilized to predict the crown convergence monitoring curves of four sections of Huzhubeishan Tunnel in Qinghai Province, China. Notably, the predicted curves exhibited a significant level of concordance with the actual monitoring curves. The results of Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) suggested that time, tunnel depth ratio and groundwater table were more important than other input variables. The XGBoost model showed the best robustness of prediction performance across varying dataset sizes for seven distinct machine learning models. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Ambient air pollution is a pervasive global issue that poses significant health risks. Among pollutants, ozone (O<inf>3</inf>) is responsible for an estimated 1 to 1.2 million premature deaths yearly. Furthermore, O<inf>3</inf> adversely affects climate warming, crop productivity, and more. Its formation occurs when nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds react with short-wavelength solar radiation. Consequently, urban areas with high traffic volume and elevated temperatures are particularly prone to elevated O<inf>3</inf> levels, which pose a significant health risk to their inhabitants. In response to this problem, many countries have developed web and mobile applications that provide real-time air pollution information using sensor data. However, while these applications offer valuable insight into current pollution levels, predicting future pollutant behavior is crucial for effective planning and mitigation strategies. Therefore, our main objectives are to develop accurate and efficient prediction models and identify the key factors that influence O<inf>3</inf> levels. We adopt a time series forecasting approach to address these objectives, which allows us to analyze and predict future O<inf>3</inf> behavior. Additionally, we tackle the feature selection problem to identify the most relevant features and periods that contribute to prediction accuracy by introducing a novel method called the Time Selection Layer in Deep Learning models, which significantly improves model performance, reduces complexity, and enhances interpretability. Our study focuses on data collected from five representative areas in Seville, Cordova, and Jaen provinces in Spain, using multiple sensors to capture comprehensive pollution data. We compare the performance of three models: Lasso, Decision Tree, and Deep Learning with and without incorporating the Time Selection Layer. Our results demonstrate that including the Time Selection Layer significantly enhances the effectiveness and interpretability of Deep Learning models, achieving an average effectiveness improvement of 9% across all monitored areas. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Estimating the life of disc cutters in tunnel boring machines is crucial for tunnel excavation efficiency. Accordingly, generating accurate predictions of the state of disc cutters can prevent unexpected downtimes while optimizing cutting performance. The literature presents investigations of the application of machine learning (ML) for estimating the disc cutter life. Nevertheless, diverse excavation conditions and data scarcity have stimulated research on transfer learning (TL) frameworks that tailor models for different domains, that is, domain adaptation (DA), by generating a common subspace in which the discrepancies among them are minimized. This study presents an end-to-end framework to estimate the disc cutter life through transfer component analysis, a DA-based method for projecting different domains by considering excavation project datasets in a common space; then, different ML models are trained, including linear, probabilistic, and neural methods. The results revealed that the Gaussian process regression model was superior to other methods, with R2 = 0.99. In conclusion, TL is a valuable tool for estimating disc cutter life across different domains, enabling accurate predictions and leveraging knowledge to mitigate data scarcity challenges. In addition, an explainable AI analysis is conducted to quantify and identify relevant features impacting negatively on the disc cutter life, evidencing great contribution from the cutter rotation speed, quartz content, screw rate and specific energy. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Applying machine learning (ML) models within recommender systems (RSs) has proven effective in achieving high recommendation accuracy. However, a prevalent drawback is their inherent lack of explicability. Integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) into RSs enhances interpretability by elucidating the reasoning behind specific recommendations. Explainability evaluation in RSs often relies on subjective metrics assessed using qualitative user feedback. Although they offer a robust foundation for evaluating explainability, they are susceptible to confirmation bias. Quantitative metrics for assessing the explainability of KG-driven RSs are currently unavailable. This study, thus, proposes novel metrics for the quantitative evaluation of explanation quality in KG-based RSs. The proposed metric, Max Explainability Score, is based on four evaluation parameters: the number of rules, the probability of the traversal path, the entropy value and the reward due to the chosen traversal paths. User studies employing these metrics offer enhanced validity and better integration potential with future XAI research. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The quality evaluation of sweetpotatoes is of utmost importance during postharvest handling as it significantly impacts consumer satisfaction, nutritional value, and market competitiveness. This study presents an innovative approach that integrates explainable artificial intelligence (AI) with hyperspectral imaging to enhance the assessment of three important quality attributes in sweetpotatoes, i.e., dry matter content, soluble solid content, and firmness. Sweetpotato samples of three different varieties, including “Bayou Belle”, “Murasaki”, and “Orleans”, were imaged using a portable visible near-infrared hyperspectral imaging (VNIR-HSI) camera, with a 400–1000 nm spectral range. The extracted spectral data were used to select key wavelengths, develop multivariate regression models, and utilize SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values to ascertain model effectiveness and interpretability. The regression models (dry matter: R2<inf>p</inf> = 0.92, RMSEP = 1.50 % and RPD = 5.58; soluble solid content: R2<inf>p</inf> = 0.66, RMSEP = 0.85obrix, and RPD = 1.72; firmness: R2<inf>p</inf> = 0.85; RMSEP = 1.66 N and RPD = 2.63) developed with key wavelengths were used to generate prediction maps to visualize the spatial distribution of response attributes, facilitating an improved evaluation of sweetpotato quality. The study demonstrated that the combination of HSI, variable selection, and explainable AI has the potential to enhance the quality assessment of sweetpotatoes, ensuring supplies of higher quality products to consumers. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Simplicial map neural networks (SMNNs) are topology-based neural networks with interesting properties such as universal approximation ability and robustness to adversarial examples under appropriate conditions. However, SMNNs present some bottlenecks for their possible application in high-dimensional datasets. First, SMNNs have precomputed fixed weight and no SMNN training process has been defined so far, so they lack generalization ability. Second, SMNNs require the construction of a convex polytope surrounding the input dataset. In this paper, we overcome these issues by proposing an SMNN training procedure based on a support subset of the given dataset and replacing the construction of the convex polytope by a method based on projections to a hypersphere. In addition, the explainability capacity of SMNNs and effective implementation are also newly introduced in this paper. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this research, the multilayer perceptron (MLP), also known as error backpropagation neural networks, is made transparent and explainable by contrasting with the commonly applied multiple linear regression (MLR). A novel MLP-based method for performing global sensitivity analysis is formalized to tackle complicated, nonexplainable simulation models or artificial intelligence (AI) models, which were developed to support critical decisions in construction engineering. The sensitivity analysis results serve as further evidence to validate the decision support models and lend new insights into the problems under investigation. The proposed new method was applied in two case studies in construction engineering, they are: precast viaduct installation cycles and concrete strength development. In both applications, the results of sensitivity analysis were represented in straightforward forms and effectively cross-checked with the existing knowledge of the problem domain or the experiences of construction practitioners. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper we consider the interactive processes by which an explainer and an explainee cooperate to produce an explanation, which we refer to as co-construction. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is concerned with the development of intelligent systems and robots that can explain and justify their actions, decisions, recommendations, and so on. However, the cooperative construction of explanations remains a key but under-explored issue. This short paper proposes an architecture for intelligent systems that promotes a co-constructive and interactive approach to explanation generation. By outlining its basic components and their specific roles, we aim to contribute to the advancement of XAI computational frameworks that actively engage users in the explanation process. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The workability of fresh concrete is highly important in terms of construction quality and safety. Slump tests are required every 120 m³, yet automated monitoring for each concrete batch remains unavailable in the actual concrete batching plant. To mitigate this issue, we propose an automatic slump prediction method based on the VGG16 neural network by analyzing the video from the final discharge hopper of the batching plant. Additionally, Explainable AI (XAI) is adopted to evaluate and validate our automatic concrete quality inspection approach. Iteratively examining XAI outputs and applying necessary adjustments in data preprocessing helps to achieve better overall performance. The proposed video classification method performed by averaging over the image-level predictions can classify the concrete into four slump classes with an average precision of 85% and an average F1 score of 87%. This demonstrates the possibility of continuous quality evaluation for all concrete produced in the concrete batching plant. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents a deep-learning-based system for classifying pig postures, aiming to improve the management of sustainable smart pigsties. The classification of pig postures is a crucial concern for researchers investigating pigsty environments and for on-site pigsty managers. To address this issue, we developed a comprehensive system framework for pig posture classification within a pigsty. We collected image datasets from an open data sharing site operated by a public organization and systematically conducted the following steps: object detection, data labeling, image preprocessing, model development, and training. These processes were carried out using the acquired datasets to ensure comprehensive and effective training for our pig posture classification system. Subsequently, we analyzed and discussed the classification results using techniques such as Grad-CAM. As a result of visual analysis through Grad-CAM, it is possible to identify image features when posture is correctly classified or misclassified in a pig image. By referring to these results, it is expected that the accuracy of pig posture classification can be further improved. Through this analysis and discussion, we can identify which features of pig postures in images need to be emphasized to improve the accuracy of pig posture classification. The findings of this study are anticipated to significantly improve the accuracy of pig posture classification. In practical applications, the proposed pig posture classification system holds the potential to promptly detect abnormal situations in pigsties, leading to prompt responses. Ultimately, this can greatly contribute to increased productivity in pigsty operations, fostering efficiency enhancements in pigsty management. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Water Distribution Networks (WDNs) are susceptible to pipe failures with significant consequences. Predicting wall-thickness loss in pipes is vital for proactive maintenance and asset management. This study develops optimized, explainable machine learning models for this purpose. Data from four WDNs located in Canada and the USA are collected and preprocessed. Decision Tree, Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost are employed, with optimized hyperparameters via Tree-Structured Parzen Estimator. The proposed framework performance is assessed using dissimilarity-based and similarity-based metrics. Hyperparameter optimization substantially enhances predictive performance such that the mean absolute error of RF improved by 20.51%. Based on the evaluation metrics, the Copeland algorithm was employed to rank the models, and CatBoost emerged as the best-performing model with a Copeland score of 4, followed by XGBoost and RF. The Taylor Diagram offers a visual representation of the linear proportionality between observed and predicted values across various models, with CatBoost and XGBoost showing strong alignment. SHAP analysis identifies age, diameter, and length as key contributors. The optimized models proactively identify potential pipe failures, enhancing maintenance and WDN management. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The use of machine learning models for productivity prediction in complex manufacturing systems has garnered significant attention. However, the implementation of conventional black-box machine learning models is challenging due to the complexity and limited data availability in aircraft final assembly lines. These challenges stem from a lack of explainability, leading to compromised accuracy and diminished trustworthiness. To address this issue, this paper proposes an explainable neural network model, the Attention-SP-LSTM-FIG, specifically designed for productivity prediction in aircraft final assembly lines. First, the serial-parallel LSTM is utilized to map the process sequence within each assembly station, and a customized attention mechanism maps the requirements of workers and materials. This process results in independent sub-models corresponding to each station. Subsequently, the outputs from each sub-model are combined using a specially-designed final integrated gate to produce the final output. Finally, a post-hoc analysis of the weight data in the model is performed following the backpropagation order to identify the various production bottlenecks in the assembly line. The performance of the proposed model has been evaluated through an industrial case study. In terms of accuracy, the Attention-SP-LSTM-FIG surpasses other benchmark neural network models in terms of error, correlation, and precision metrics. Regarding explainability, the Attention-SP-LSTM-FIG can precisely identify bottlenecks for practitioners, thus facilitating a better understanding of the rationale behind the model's outputs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Built environment (BE) is widely perceived as crucial in promoting physical activities (PA). However, the nonlinear and interaction relationships between multilevel (macroscale and microscale) BE and outdoor jogging are poorly explained. Therefore, this work established an explainable machine learning-based analytical framework that integrating Gradient Boosting Decision Tree and SHapley Additive exPlanations to interpret the nonlinear and interaction effects. Employing Beijing, China as the case, this study conducted an empirical analysis of multilevel BE factors affecting outdoor jogging utilizing multi-source big data, including large-scale jogging GPS trajectories and street view images. Results revealed that: (1) Macroscale BE including sports amenities and accessibility play an important role in affecting jogging. (2) All BE factors have nonlinear association with jogging, and the effective range and threshold effects vary by variables. Notably, several variables associated with jogging are in inverted U or V shapes. (3) The complex interaction effects including synergistic, weakened, among BE factors were scrutinized. BE factors regarding accessibility and sports amenity interact more easily. (4) Regions with similar local effects were clustered to understand the spatial varying of BE's influences and establish targeted interventions. These findings can help urban planners design more nuanced intervention strategies for supporting outdoor jogging. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cement-based foam has emerged as a strong contender in sustainable construction owing to its superior thermal and sound insulation properties, fire resistance, and cost-effectiveness. To effectively use cement-based foam as a thermal insulation material, it is important to accurately predict its thermal conductivity. The current study aims at coining an accurate methodology for predicting the thermal conductivity of cement-based foam using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. A comprehensive experimental dataset of 504 data points was developed and used for training ensemble learning models including XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM and Random Forest. The independent variables of this dataset affecting the thermal conductivity are the cast density, percentage of pozzolan, porosity, percentage of moisture, and duration of hydration in days. Using the Isolation Forest algorithm proved effective in detecting and eliminating outliers in the dataset. All the ensemble learning techniques explored in this study achieved superior predictive accuracy with a coefficient of determination greater than 0.98 on the test dataset. The influence of the input features on the thermal conductivity was visualized using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) approach and individual conditional expectation (ICE) plots. The cast density had the greatest effect on thermal conductivity. The explainable machine learning models demonstrated superior accuracy, efficiency, and reliability in estimating the thermal insulation of cement-based foam, opening the door for wider acceptance of this material in sustainable energy efficient construction. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Deep neural networks have revolutionized many fields, but their black-box nature also occasionally prevents their wider adoption in fields such as healthcare and finance, where interpretable and explainable models are required. The recent development of Neural Additive Models (NAMs) is a significant step in the direction of interpretable deep learning for tabular datasets. In this paper, we propose a new subclass of NAMs that use a single-layer neural network construction of the Gaussian process via random Fourier features, which we call Gaussian Process Neural Additive Models (GP-NAM). GP-NAMs have the advantage of a convex objective function and number of trainable parameters that grows linearly with feature dimensionality. It suffers no loss in performance compared to deeper NAM approaches because GPs are well-suited for learning complex non-parametric univariate functions. We demonstrate the performance of GP-NAM on several tabular datasets, showing that it achieves comparable or better performance in both classification and regression tasks with a large reduction in the number of parameters. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The proliferation of classification-capable artificial intelligence (AI) across a wide range of domains (e.g., agriculture, construction, etc.) has been allowed to optimize and complement several tasks, typically operationalized by humans. The computational training that allows providing such support is frequently hindered by various challenges related to datasets, including the scarcity of examples and imbalanced class distributions, which have detrimental effects on the production of accurate models. For a proper approach to these challenges, strategies smarter than the traditional brute force-based K-fold cross-validation or the naivety of hold-out are required, with the following main goals in mind: (1) carrying out one-shot, close-to-optimal data arrangements, accelerating conventional training optimization; and (2) aiming at maximizing the capacity of inference models to its fullest extent while relieving computational burden. To that end, in this paper, two image-based feature-aware dataset splitting approaches are proposed, hypothesizing a contribution towards attaining classification models that are closer to their full inference potential. Both rely on strategic image harvesting: while one of them hinges on weighted random selection out of a feature-based clusters set, the other involves a balanced picking process from a sorted list that stores data features’ distances to the centroid of a whole feature space. Comparative tests on datasets related to grapevine leaves phenotyping and bridge defects showcase promising results, highlighting a viable alternative to K-fold cross-validation and hold-out methods. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Forecasting fluid flow in subsurface resources such as groundwater, geothermal, and oil and gas is essential to maximize project economics and maximize resource recovery. We propose a novel workflow for a data-driven surrogate flow model for subsurface forecasting using an attention-based deep neural network architecture. The proposed workflow allows the inclusion of static and dynamic predictor features and forecasting across multiple wells with low error predictions. The study reveals that the proposed workflow can be applied over a wide range of subsurface resources and can improve well productivity, maximize resource recovery, and project economics. The proposed workflow also provides a more interpretable model with diagnostics to evaluate the quality of the resulting model. This study contributes to the development of new methods and workflows to integrate widely available historical production data into multi-step time series forecasting, which can be applied to subsurface resources beyond the ones studied here. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - To improve the current manual and iterative nature of clash resolution on construction projects, current research efforts continue to explore and test the utilization of machine-learning algorithms to automate the process. Though current research shows significant accuracy in automating clash resolution, many have failed to provide clear explanation and justification for the selection of their feature and label space. Since this is critical in developing an effective and explainable solution in machine learning, it is crucial to address this research gap. In this paper, the authors utilize an in-depth literature review and industry interviews to capture domain knowledge on how design clashes are resolved by industry experts. From analysis of the knowledge captured, we identified 23 factors considered by experts when resolving clashes and five alternative solutions/options to resolve a clash. Using a pool of industry experts, a modified Delphi approach was conducted to validate the factors and options and to determine a priority ranking. The authors identified 94 industry experts based on a predetermined qualification matrix to take part in the modified Delphi. Twelve participants responded and took part in the first round, and 11 completed the second round. A consensus was reached on all clash factors and resolution options. Factors including "clashing elements type,""constrained slope,""critical element in the clash,""location of the clash,""code compliance,"and "project stage clashing element is in"were ranked as the most important factors, while "clashing element material"and "insulation type"were considered the least important. Participants also showed more preference to the "moving the clashing element with low priority in/along x-y-z directions"option to resolve clashes. These identified factors and options will be utilized to collect specific clash data to train and test effective and explainable machine-learning algorithms toward automating clash resolution. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Globally, lung and colon cancers are among the most prevalent and lethal tumors. Early cancer identification is essential to increase the likelihood of survival. Histopathological images are considered an appropriate tool for diagnosing cancer, which is tedious and error-prone if done manually. Recently, machine learning methods based on feature engineering have gained prominence in automatic histopathological image classification. Furthermore, these methods are more interpretable than deep learning, which operates in a “black box” manner. In the medical profession, the interpretability of a technique is critical to gaining the trust of end users to adopt it. In view of the above, this work aims to create an accurate and interpretable machine-learning technique for the automated classification of lung and colon cancers from histopathology images. In the proposed approach, following the preprocessing steps, texture and color features are retrieved by utilizing the Haralick and Color histogram feature extraction algorithms, respectively. The obtained features are concatenated to form a single feature set. The three feature sets (texture, color, and combined features) are passed into the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) classifier for classification. And their performance is evaluated on the LC25000 dataset using hold-out and stratified 10-fold cross-validation (Stratified 10-FCV) techniques. With a test/hold-out set, the LightGBM with texture, color, and combined features classifies the lung and colon cancer images with 97.72%, 99.92%, and 100% accuracy respectively. In addition, a stratified 10-fold cross-validation method also revealed that LightGBM’s combined or color features performed well, with an excellent mean auc_mu score and a low mean multi_logloss value. Thus, this proposed technique can help histologists detect and classify lung and colon histopathology images more efficiently, effectively, and economically, resulting in more productivity.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) and Machine learning (ML) are increasingly used for digital twin development in energy and engineering systems, but these models must be fair, unbiased, interpretable, and explainable. It is critical to have confidence in AI's trustworthiness. ML techniques have been useful in predicting important parameters and improving model performance. However, for these AI techniques to be useful in making decisions, they need to be audited, accounted for, and easy to understand. Therefore, the use of explainable AI (XAI) and interpretable machine learning (IML) is crucial for the accurate prediction of prognostics, such as remaining useful life (RUL), in a digital twin system to make it intelligent while ensuring that the AI model is transparent in its decision-making processes and that the predictions it generates can be understood and trusted by users. By using an explainable, interpretable, and trustworthy AI, intelligent digital twin systems can make more accurate predictions of RUL, leading to better maintenance and repair planning and, ultimately, improved system performance. This paper aims to explain the ideas of XAI and IML and justify the important role of AI/ML for the digital twin components, which requires XAI to understand the prediction better. This paper explains the importance and fundamentals of XAI and IML in both local and global aspects in terms of feature selection, model interpretability, and model diagnosis and validation to ensure the reliable use of trustworthy AI/ML applications for RUL prediction. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Predicting the Curie temperature (T<inf>c</inf>) is a crucial problem in the field of amorphous alloys. In this study, Fe-based amorphous alloys are taken as an example, and the composition and corresponding T<inf>c</inf> are collected through a literature review. Three feature construction strategies are employed to establish the relationship between the composition and T<inf>c</inf> using machine learning. The research findings demonstrate that the combination of the Meredig rule and the GBT algorithm yields the highest prediction accuracy. The features are constructed using recursive elimination and enumeration methods, ultimately resulting in an optimal 8-dimensional feature subset. Furthermore, the Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values are introduced to analyze the interpretability of the prediction model, providing a feature importance ranking and their critical values. Finally, by replacing the Fe and P atoms with Mn and Si atoms, respectively, in the Fe80P13C7 alloy, Fe62Mn18P(13-x)C7Six (x = 4,5,6) alloys are successfully designed to exhibit a Tc close to room temperature (335 K), enabling customized Tc design for Fe-based amorphous alloys. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The feature attribution-based explanation (FAE) methods, which indicate how much each input feature contributes to the model's output for a given data point, are one of the most popular categories of explainable machine learning techniques. Although various metrics have been proposed to evaluate the explanation quality, no single metric could capture different aspects of the explanations. Different conclusions might be drawn using different metrics. Moreover, during the processes of generating explanations, existing FAE methods either do not consider any evaluation metric or only consider the faithfulness of the explanation, failing to consider multiple metrics simultaneously. To address this issue, we formulate the problem of creating FAE explainable models as a multi-objective learning problem that considers multiple explanation quality metrics simultaneously. We first reveal conflicts between various explanation quality metrics, including faithfulness, sensitivity, and complexity. Then, we define the considered multi-objective explanation problem and propose a multi-objective feature attribution explanation (MOFAE) framework to address this newly defined problem. Subsequently, we instantiate the framework by simultaneously considering the explanation's faithfulness, sensitivity, and complexity. Experimental results comparing with six state-of-The-Art FAE methods on eight datasets demonstrate that our method can optimize multiple conflicting metrics simultaneously and can provide explanations with higher faithfulness, lower sensitivity, and lower complexity than the compared methods. Moreover, the results have shown that our method has better diversity, i.e., it provides various explanations that achieve different tradeoffs between multiple conflicting explanation quality metrics. Therefore, it can provide tailored explanations to different stakeholders based on their specific requirements. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The transition to a sustainable energy supply challenges the operation of electric power systems in various ways. Transmission grid loads increase as wind and solar power is often installed far away from the consumers. System operators resolve grid congestion via countertrading or redispatch to ensure grid stability. While some drivers of congestion are known, the magnitude of their impact is unclear, and other factors might still be unidentified. In this study, we conduct a data-driven investigation of congestion in the German transmission grid that reveals drivers and mitigators and quantifies their impact ex-post. Specifically, we used Gradient Boosted Trees and SHAP values to develop an explainable machine learning model for the hourly volume of redispatch and countertrade. As expected, wind power generation in northern Germany emerged as the main driver. Cross-border electricity trading, especially with Denmark, also plays an important role. German solar power has very little effect. Furthermore, our results suggest that run-of-river generation in the alpine region has a strong mitigating effect. Our results support the idea that market design changes, e.g., a bidding zone split, could contribute to congestion prevention. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Accurate air quality analysis is essential for comprehending the reasons for and consequences of air pollution, which is a serious environmental concern. Understanding the underlying causes contributing to pollution levels is challenging when using traditional methodologies for air quality analysis since they frequently lack transparency and interpretability. This work examines the integration of XAI with deep learning to enhance air quality prediction. Explainable AI provides a solution by illuminating the ways in which AI models make decisions. It emphasizes the requirement for clear and understandable AI models to win stakeholders' trust and adoption. Utilizing explainable AI makes it feasible to improve the readability and transparency of air quality studies, allowing stakeholders to comprehend and verify the predictions and suggestions made by AI systems. Rough woodland. To classify the data, XGBoost and KNN are used. SHAP and LIME are then applied to discover the major characteristics and variables that affect air quality predictions. These findings can help to improve decision-making and the creation of efficient plans for the management and mitigation of air quality. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing across technology domains including healthcare, commerce, the economy, the environment, cybersecurity, transportation, etc. AI will transform healthcare systems, bringing profound changes to diagnosis, treatment, patient care, data, medicines, devices, etc. However, AI in healthcare introduces entirely new categories of risk for assessment, management, and communication. For this topic, the framing of conventional risk and decision analyses is ongoing. This paper introduces a method to quantify risk as the disruption of the order of AI initiatives in healthcare systems, aiming to find the scenarios that are most and least disruptive to system order. This novel approach addresses scenarios that bring about a re-ordering of initiatives in each of the following three characteristic layers: purpose, structure, and function. In each layer, the following model elements are identified: 1. Typical research and development initiatives in healthcare. 2. The ordering criteria of the initiatives. 3. Emergent conditions and scenarios that could influence the ordering of the AI initiatives. This approach is a manifold accounting of the scenarios that could contribute to the risk associated with AI in healthcare. Recognizing the context-specific nature of risks and highlighting the role of human in the loop, this study identifies scenario s.06—non-interpretable AI and lack of human–AI communications—as the most disruptive across all three layers of healthcare systems. This finding suggests that AI transparency solutions primarily target domain experts, a reasonable inclination given the significance of “high-stakes” AI systems, particularly in healthcare. Future work should connect this approach with decision analysis and quantifying the value of information. Future work will explore the disruptions of system order in additional layers of the healthcare system, including the environment, boundary, interconnections, workforce, facilities, supply chains, and others. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding the built environment’s impact on metro ridership is essential for developing targeted strategies for built environment renewal. Taking into consideration the limitations of existing studies, such as not proposing targeted strategies, using unified pedestrian catchment areas (PCA), and not determining the model’s accuracy, Beijing was divided into three zones from inside to outside by the distribution pattern of metro stations. Three PCAs were assumed for each zone and a total of 27 PCA combinations. The study compared the accuracy of the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) and several machine learning models under each PCA combination to determine the model to be used in this study and the recommended PCA combination for the three zones. Under the recommended PCA combinations for the three zones, the model with the highest accuracy was used to explore the built environment’s impact on metro ridership. Finally, prioritized stations for renewal were identified based on ridership and the built environment’s impact on metro ridership. The results are as follows: (1) The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model has a higher accuracy and was appropriate for this study. The recommended PCA combination for the three zones in Beijing was 1000 m_1200 m_1800 m. (2) During the morning peak hours, the density of office and apartment facilities greatly influenced the ridership, with a strong threshold effect and spatial heterogeneity. Our research framework also provides a new way for other cities to determine the scope of Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) and proposes a new decision-making method for improving the vibrancy of metro stations. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This article explores the convergence of artificial intelligence and its challenges for precise planning of LoRa networks. It examines machine learning algorithms in conjunction with empirically collected data to develop an effective propagation model for LoRaWAN. We propose decoupling feature extraction and regression analysis, which facilitates training data requirements. In our comparative analysis, decision-tree-based gradient boosting achieved the lowest root-mean-squared error of 5.53 dBm. Another advantage of this model is its interpretability, which is exploited to qualitatively observe the governing propagation mechanisms. This approach provides a unique opportunity to practically understand the dependence of signal strength on other variables. The analysis revealed a 1.5 dBm sensitivity improvement as the LoR’s spreading factor changed from 7 to 12. The impact of clutter was revealed to be highly non-linear, with high attenuations as clutter increased until a certain point, after which it became ineffective. The outcome of this work leads to a more accurate estimation and a better understanding of the LoRa’s propagation. Consequently, mitigating the challenges associated with large-scale and dense LoRaWAN deployments, enabling improved link budget analysis, interference management, quality of service, scalability, and energy efficiency of Internet of Things networks. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Agriculture serves as the predominant driver of a country's economy, constituting the largest share of the nation's manpower. Most farmers are facing a problem in choosing the most appropriate crop that can yield better based on the environmental conditions and make profits for them. As a consequence of this, there will be a notable decline in their overall productivity. Precision agriculture has effectively resolved the issues encountered by farmers. Today's farmers may benefit from what's known as precision agriculture. This method takes into account local climate, soil type, and past crop yields to determine which varieties will provide the best results. The explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) technique is used with radial basis functions neural network and spider monkey optimization to classify suitable crops based on the underlying soil and environmental conditions. The XAI technology would provide assets in better transparency of the prediction model on deciding the most suitable crops for their farms, taking into account a variety of geographical and operational criteria. The proposed model is assessed using standard metrics like precision, recall, accuracy, and F1-score. In contrast to other cutting-edge approaches discussed in this study, the model has shown fair performance with approximately 12% better accuracy than the other models considered in the current study. Similarly, precision has improvised by 10%, recall by 11%, and F1-score by 10%. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is a burgeoning concept. It is gaining prominence as an approach to better understand how artificial intelligence solutions' outputs can improve decision making. Evaluation frameworks to enable organizations to understand XAIs what, why, how, and when are yet to be developed. Thus, we aim to fill this void by developing a conceptual content, context, process, and outcome (CCPO) evaluation framework to justify XAIs adoption and effective management using construction organizations as a backdrop for the article's setting. After introducing and describing the proposed novel CCPO framework for operationalizing XAI, we discuss its implications for future research. The contributions of our article are twofold: First, it highlights the need for organizations to embrace and enact XAI so that decision makers and stakeholders can better understand why and how a specific prediction materializes; and second, it provides a frame of reference for organizations to realize the business value and benefits of XAI. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Battery cell production is a key contributor to achieving a net-zero future. A comprehensive understanding of the various process steps and their interdependencies is essential for speeding up the commercialization of newly developed materials and optimizing production processes. While several approaches have been employed to analyze and understand the complexity of the process chain and its interdependencies – ranging from expert- and simulation-based to data-driven – the latter holds significant potential for real-time application. This is particularly relevant for inline process control and optimization. To streamline the development and implementation of data-driven models, a holistic framework that encompasses all necessary steps – from identification of relevant parameters and generation of data to development of models – is imperative. This article aims to address this objective by presenting a comprehensive and systematic methodology, demonstrated for efficient cross-process analysis in electrode manufacturing. Through the combined utilization of design of experiments methods, data-driven models, and explainable machine learning methods, the interdependencies between production parameters and the physical, mechanical, and electrochemical characteristics of the electrodes were uncovered. These actionable insights are essential for enabling informed decision-making, facilitating the selection of appropriate process parameters, and ultimately optimizing the production process. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The data used for productivity modeling represents a sample of a company's performance taken at a particular time, which leads to varying model parameters and results in a variance of the predicted productivity. This research enhances the capability of the nonlinear machine learning method called Model Tree by integrating error propagation theory to determine the variance for the predicted productivity based on a relatively large dataset available for productivity analysis. The enhanced model tree is formalized and applied in modeling structural steel fabrication productivity and piping spool fabrication productivity. The enhanced model tree is preferred over artificial neural networks due to the model's capability to explain the productivity model concerning the variance of its predicted point value and the underlying reasoning logic. The enhanced model tree will potentially find its applications in construction beyond predicting labor productivity and make a further impact on implementing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in wide-ranging engineering domains. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - “Black box” models created by modern machine learning techniques are typically hard to interpret. Thus, the necessity of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has grown for understanding the rationale behind those models and converting them into white boxes. Random Forest is a black box model essential in various domains due to its flexibility, ease of use, and remarkable predictive performance. One method for explaining a Random Forest is transforming it into a self-explainable Decision Tree using Forest-Based Tree (FBT) algorithm. It basically consists of three main phases, pruning, conjunction set generation, and Decision Tree construction. In this paper, we examine six state-of-the-art pruning approaches and analyze their effect on FBT performance through pruned FBT (PFBT) in order to minimize its computational complexity. This would make it appropriate for forests and datasets of any size. They are assessed on 30 datasets, and the results show that UMEP and Hybrid pruning methods can be effectively used in the pruning stage of the PFBT algorithm in terms of pruning time and predictive performance. However, the AUC-Greedy method achieves good performance with small-size datasets. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Phishing and social engineering contribute to various cyber incidents such as data breaches and ransomware attacks, financial frauds, and denial of service attacks. Often, phishers discuss these attack vectors in dark forums. Further, the probability of phishing attacks and the subsequent loss suffered by the firm are highly correlated. In this context, we propose a hybrid framework using explainable AI techniques to assess cyber-risks generated from correlated phishing attacks. The first phase computes the probability of expert phishers within a community of similar attackers with varying expertise. The second phase calculates the probability of phishing attacks upon a firm even after it has invested in IT security and adopted regulatory steps. The third phase categorises phishing and genuine URLs using various machine-learning-based classifiers. Next, it estimates the joint distribution of phishing attacks using an exponential-beta distribution and quantifies the expected loss using Archimedean Copula. Finally, we offer recommendations for firms through the computation of optimal investments in cyber-insurance versus IT security. First, based on the risk attitude of a firm, it can use this explainable-AI (XAI) framework to optimally invest in building security into its enterprise architecture and plan for cyber-risk mitigation strategies. Second, we identify a long-tail phenomenon demonstrated by the losses suffered during most cyber-attacks, which are not one-off incidents and are correlated. Third, contrary to the belief that cyber-insurance markets are ineffective, it can guide financial firms to design realistic cyber-insurance products. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Load Disaggregation, or Non-intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM), refers to the process of estimating energy consumption of individual domestic appliances from aggregated household consumption. Recently, Deep Learning (DL) approaches have seen increased adoption in NILM community. However, DL NILM models are often treated as black-box algorithms, which introduces algorithmic transparency and explainability concerns, hindering wider adoption. Recent works have investigated explainability of DL NILM, however they are limited to computationally expensive methods or simple classification problems. In this work, we present a methodology for explainability of regression-based DL NILM with visual explanations, using explainable AI (XAI). Two explainability levels are provided. Sequence-level explanations highlight important features of predicted time-series sequence of interest, while point-level explanations enable visualising explanations at a point in time. To facilitate wider adoption of XAI, we define desirable properties of NILM explanations - faithfulness, robustness and effective complexity. Addressing the limitation of existing XAI NILM approaches that don't assess the quality of explanations, desirable properties of explanations are used for quantitative evaluation of explainability. We show that proposed framework enables better understanding of NILM outputs and helps improve design by providing a visualization strategy and rigorous evaluation of quality of XAI methods, leading to transparency of outcomes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Industry 5.0 is a emerging transformative model that aims to develop a hyperconnected, automated, and data-driven industrial ecosystem. This digital transformation will boost productivity and efficiency throughout the production process but will be more prone to new sophisticated cyber-attacks. Deep learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have the potential to recognize intrusions with high accuracy. However, these models are complex and are treated as a black box by developers and security analysts due to the inability to interpret the decisions made by these models. Motivated by the challenges, this paper presents an explainable and resilient IDS for Industry 5.0. The proposed IDS is designed by combining bidirectional long short-term memory networks (BiLSTM), a bidirectional-gated recurrent unit (Bi-GRU), fully connected layers and a softmax classifier to enhance the intrusion detection process in Industry 5.0. We employ the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) mechanism to interpret and understand the features that contributed the most in the decision of the proposed cyber-resilient IDS. The evaluation of the proposed model using the explainability can ensure that the model is working as expected. The experimental results based on the CICDDoS2019 dataset confirms the superiority of the proposed IDS over some recent approaches. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the EU confirms the protection of personal data as a fundamental human right and affords data subjects more control over the way their personal information is processed, shared, and analyzed. However, where data are processed by artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, asserting control and providing adequate explanations is a challenge. Due to massive increases in computing power and big data processing, modern AI algorithms are too complex and opaque to be understood by most data subjects. Articles 15 and 22 of the GDPR provide a modest regulatory framework for automated data processing by, among other things, mandating that data controllers inform data subjects about when it is being used, and its logic and ramifications. Nevertheless, due to the phrasing of the articles and the numerous exceptions they allow, doubts have arisen about their effectiveness. In this paper, we empirically evaluate the quality and effectiveness of AI disclosures as mandated by the GDPR. By means of an online survey (N = 835), we investigated how data subjects expect to be informed about the automated processing of their data. We then conducted a content analysis of the AI disclosures of N = 100 companies and organizations. The combined findings reveal that current GDPR-mandated disclosures do not meet the expectations and needs of data subjects. Explanations drawn up following the guidelines of the generic formulations of the GDPR differ widely and are often vague, incomplete and lack transparency. In our conclusions we identify a path towards standardizing and optimizing AI information notices. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Deep neural network has achieved remarkable success in fields such as image classification and object detection, sometimes even outperforming humans, but the black-box nature of deep neural networks limits their application in areas where the reasons for decisions need to be known. The increasing demand for more transparent and reliable models has led to the emergence of explainable machine learning, and more and more researchers have turned their attention to the interpretability of deep neural networks in an attempt to explore the inference process of the model by investigating the black-box properties of the network. Based on the different stages of explanation generation, we can broadly classify interpretable neural networks into two categories: post-hoc interpretable models and intrinsically interpretable models. In recent years, there have been numerous researches on interpretable neural networks, but nevertheless, there is still a lack of a unified classification and summary of the construction of intrinsically interpretable networks. In this paper, we review several typical approaches to building intrinsically interpretable neural networks in the field of image classification that have proposed in recent years, classify them according to the way they achieve interpretability, and summarize the strengths and weaknesses of each type of approach. Furthermore, we provide an outlook on future developments in this field. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In precision livestock farming, accurate cattle identification is essential for enhancing animal welfare, health monitoring, and productivity, while also supporting traceability and minimizing false insurance claims. This paper presents a novel approach for cattle identification using muzzle prints, with a focus on both efficiency and explainability. Taxicab metric, employed for efficient annotation of muzzle patterns significantly reduces the labeling time for training of YOLOv8 model. YOLOv8 is utilized for detecting muzzle prints in images, followed by SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) for feature extraction and matching. The incorporation of Explainable AI (XAI) methods, particularly Grad-CAM, further enhances the transparency and interpretability of the SIFT model. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Obesity, a major global health concern, is linked to several life-threatening conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer. Early detection of obesity is crucial for effective intervention and prevention strategies. In this study, we investigate the performance of advanced machine learning techniques, specifically gradient boosting models-XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost-for predicting obesity risk levels using medical, demographic, and lifestyle data. Rigorous preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation were employed to ensure robust model development. XGBoost emerged as the most accurate model with an outstanding validation accuracy of 91.67%, followed by LightGBM and CatBoost. Despite minor overfitting in LightGBM, all three models demonstrated exceptional generalization capabilities. The findings highlight the potential of gradient boosting models for enhancing early obesity detection and personalized risk management in healthcare settings. Future work could focus on expanding the dataset, integrating explainable AI for better model interpretation, and exploring hybrid or deep learning models to further improve predictive performance. These results provide a solid foundation for implementing machine learning-based systems in public health programs aimed at combating the obesity epidemic. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The ECG is fundamental in detecting cardiovascular ailments, and its thorough analysis is imperative. The analysis of conventional ECG depends on interpretation based on the expertise of the professional, which is slow and prone to mistakes. Deep learning models, which include CNNs, LSTMs, and Attention techniques introduced recently, have demonstrated promising results in the automation of ECG classification with high accuracy. However, a major drawback regarding these models is the 'black box' nature, which goes against clinical usage and comparison. This study adopts SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) techniques under deep learning algorithms for identifying ECG heartbeats. The model is trained and tested on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, and the performance seems to be accurate with an overall accuracy of 98.25%. Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations involving the construction of a local model, such as LIME and Shapely Additive explanations, or SHAP, help to provide more explanation regarding what the model is doing, thus increasing its reliability for clinical use. In this paper, the focus is presented on the experiment's method and outcomes, with a discussion of the interpretability of the final model as a crucial factor in its application in medical diagnostics. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - India, the world's fastest-growing major economy, remains a bright spot amid global recession concerns. However, despite its economic success, the country faces challenges in enhancing the happiness of its over 1.4 billion citizens, ranking a low 126th out of 146 nations in the recent World Happiness Report (WHR). Although the central and state governments have introduced various happiness measurement and promotion schemes, achieving significant improvement in WHR rankings remains elusive. The WHR data offers valuable insights for policymakers to understand the factors affecting happiness, its cross-cultural differences, and impact on productivity. Governments and organizations can use such insights to develop both global and localized strategies to improve citizen well-being and improve productivity. This case examines how explainable AI (XAI) and machine learning (ML) can be leveraged to identify key happiness indicators and integrate it with organizational behaviour principles to leverage employee performance. Students are tasked with analysing global and local drivers of happiness and developing predictive models using AI and ML tools. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Concrete compressive strength is crucial for optimizing concrete mix designs in construction. This study employs traditional machine learning regressors, custom ANNs, and Explainable AI (XAI) techniques using a dataset from Kaggle with 1030 instances and 9 attributes. Among the models tested, Random Forest Regression exhibited the best performance with the lowest MSE and highest R-squared (R2) values. Custom ANNs, particularly a five-layer architecture with SeLU and ReLU activations optimized using the Adam optimizer, achieved superior results with an MSE of 22.2 and an R2 of 0.92. To ensure model transparency, we used the LIME technique, revealing the contributions of individual input variables. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of advanced ML models and XAI techniques in predicting concrete compressive strength, offering a robust framework for optimizing concrete mix designs and enhancing construction practices. Future research can expand on these results by exploring larger datasets, additional features, and more advanced XAI methods. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Large Multimodal Models are emerging general AI models capable of processing and analyzing diverse data streams, including text, imagery, and sequential data. This paper explores the possibility of exploiting multimodality to develop more interpretable AI-based predictive tools for the water sector, with a first application for sewer defect detection from CCTV imagery. To this aim, we test the zero-shot generalization performance of three generalist large language-vision models for binary sewer defect detection on a subset of the SewerML dataset. We compared the LMMs against a state-of-the-art unimodal Deep Learning approach which has been trained and validated on >1 million SewerML images. Unsurprisingly, the chosen benchmark showcases the best performances, with an overall F1 Score of 0.80. Nonetheless, OpenAI GPT4-V demonstrates relatively good performances with an overall F1 Score of 0.61, displaying equal or better results than the benchmark for some defect classes. Furthermore, GPT4-V often provides text descriptions aligned with the provided prediction, accurately describing the rationale behind a certain decision. Similarly, GPT4-V displays interesting emerging behaviors for trustworthiness, such as refusing to classify images that are too blurred or unclear. Despite the significantly lower performance from the open-source models CogVLM and LLaVA, some preliminary successes suggest good potential for enhancement through fine-tuning, agentic workflows, or retrieval-augmented generation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Today, crop diversification in agriculture is a critical issue to meet the increasing demand for food and to improve food safety and quality. This issue is considered to be the most important challenge for the next generation of agriculture due to diminishing natural resources, limited arable land and unpredictable climatic conditions caused by climate change. In this paper, we employ emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning (ML) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to improve operational efficiency and productivity in the agricultural sector. Specifically, we propose an edge computing-based explainable crop recommendation system, AgroXAI, which suggests suitable crops for a region based on weather and soil conditions. In this system, we provide local and global explanations of ML model decisions with methods such as ELI5, LIME, SHAP, which we integrate into ML models. More importantly, we provide regional alternative crop recommendations with the Counterfactual explainability method. In this way, we envision that our proposed AgroXAI system will be a platform that provides regional crop diversity in the next generation agriculture. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The accurate classification of potato leaf diseases plays a pivotal role in ensuring the health and productivity of crops. This study presents a unified approach for addressing this challenge by leveraging the power of Explainable AI (XAI) and transfer learning within a deep Learning framework. In this research, we propose a transfer learning-based deep learning model that is tailored for potato leaf disease classification. Transfer learning enables the model to benefit from pre-trained neural network architectures and weights, enhancing its ability to learn meaningful representations from limited labeled data. Additionally, Explainable AI techniques are integrated into the model to provide interpretable insights into its decision-making process, contributing to its transparency and usability. We used a publicly available potato leaf disease dataset to train the model. The results obtained are 97% for validation accuracy and 98% for testing accuracy. This study applies gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) to enhance model interpretability. This interpretability is vital for improving predictive performance, fostering trust, and ensuring seamless integration into agricultural practices. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The advent of Industry 4.0 has reshaped the modern industries (e.g., Manufacturing, Automotive, Aerospace and Defense), driven by the rapid development of artificial intelligence, smart sensing technologies, and interconnected cyber-physical systems. One of the most important goal for Industry 4.0 is the improvement and enhancement in productivity, reduction of production losses, and operational efficiency. High quality fault detection within different environments is the foundation to achieve these goals. Industry 4.0 emphasizes the use of interconnected systems, smart sensors, and advanced analytics, which generate large volumes of data from production environments. The data complexity and scale, product by the widespread deployment of sensors and IoT devices, demands sophisticated Machine Learning (ML) and data-driven methods. In this paper, we argue that the future of accurate and reliable fault detection lies in the seamless fusion of edge-cloud computing, explainable AI, and adaptive machine learning algorithms capable of processing high-frequency, multimodal data streams in real time. Different kinds of advantages for multimondal learning and core enabling techniques are also discussed and revise. This vision paper outlines the future trajectory of multimodal learning based fault detection, via identifying critical research gaps and promising directions for future study. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Predictive maintenance of large-scale structures such as bridges requires precise numerical models to describe their current condition. Typically, solving an inverse problem is necessary to determine model parameters from Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) data. However, conventional methods such as Finite Element Updating through optimization algorithms demand substantial computational resources, as numerous parameter combinations need to be assessed to identify the optimal model state in each calibration step. Consequently, these methods are only partially suitable for creating digital twins of bridges. This paper introduces an alternative approach by treating the inverse problem as a model parameter classification problem. This involves establishing a model database that covers a wide range of damage states. Notably, this method eliminates the need for multiple simulations during the application phase, as simulations are performed only once in an offline context. Subsequently, a classification algorithm is trained based on this database, enabling real-time selection of the best-fit model for practical applications using SHM data, without the necessity for additional simulations. Transparency in algorithm decisions is crucial for infrastructure maintenance, therefore, optimal classification trees from the field of interpretable machine learning are employed. Decision trees offer a balance between high accuracy and interpretability while providing additional advantages, such as sensor placement evaluation. In summary, this approach demonstrates the potential for linking numerical models with SHM data through the application of interpretable machine learning techniques, facilitating real-time decision-making for the preservation and management of critical infrastructure. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The Artificial Intelligence Act was adopted in the European Parliament in March 2024 to establish a uniform legal framework for the development and uptake of human-centric and trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) in Europe. Considering that AI may generate risks and cause harm, the approach for evaluating the newly developed AI and decision support systems (DSS) will vary from domain to domain. This paper presents the approach the European Union (EU) funded project IntelliLung is currently implementing in the healthcare domain. The IEC 62559-2:2015 methodology was used to structure the IntelliLung AI-DSS requirements and define key performance indicators relevant for the functional parts of the system (data integration, pre-processing, AI modelling). "Ethics-by-design"and "Transparent AI design"methodologies have been used for the IntelliLung AI-DSS implementation. The compliance requirements analysis has shown that the trustworthiness of AI-DSS relies on a wide set of measures including information and communication security, explainable AI algorithms, data governance and privacy considerations, as well as risk-management throughout the entire lifecycle of AI-DSS as a high-risk AI system. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Machine vision in quality control and sorting applications enhance organizational efficiency.Machine vision systems are coupled with a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to enhance the capability of the system for classification and identification tasks.The overarching research goal of this study is a) to understand how a CNN decides on classifying threaded fasteners, and b) how well does the CNN's decision making compare with that of a human.In order to answer the first research question, an image-based fastener identification model augmented with a pre-trained CNN was deployed.The CNN used is called Efficient-Net-b0, that can perform a wide range of image classification tasks.The training set provided to the Efficient-Net-b0 model consisted of labeled images of 12 types of threaded fasteners.The data set was enlarged by using image augmentation techniques such as varying the brightness, contrast, and orientation of the captured images.The results produced by the CNN classifier were then parsed through Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM).This technique produce visual explanations of the decisions made by CNNs.This is the XAI component of this research.It provides transparency in the reasons for the identification and classification done by the Efficient-Net-b0, thereby providing context for the key feature of the threaded fastener that was used to classify and identify it.In order to answer the second research question, a user study was conducted.The participants of this study are novice and experienced mechanical engineers enrolled in a Bachelor's and a Master's program at two universities in the United States.The aim of this study was to answer three research sub-questions, each of which was compared to the results from the Efficient-Netb0 as explained by Grad-CAM.The three questions are: i) Can human subjects distinguish between fasteners within the same category?, ii) What features do human subjects look at when distinguishing between fasteners in the same category as compared to XAI?, and iii) Can human subjects identify the same fastener when it is placed in different orientations? The study was conducted via an online Google form that shows the participant two pictures of threaded fasteners simultaneously.There is a total of 40 pairs of images.Each set of pictures comes with two questions.The first question is a multiple-choice question that asks the user whether the image they are looking at represents the same component.The second question is a short answer question asking the user to describe their choice for the multiple-choice question.Each user answers a total of 80 questions, and the total number of participants 43, resulting in a sizable dataset.In addition to providing a comparison between the accuracy rates of both human and AI in classifying fastners the results of the experiments also gave us a better insights into the features/categories utilized by both XAI and participants to achieve the goal of fastner classification. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The article presents a study on the application of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) principles and the neuro-fuzzy system ANFIS to improve the accuracy and interpretability of environmental soil pollution monitoring in the city of Dubna. The work explores the mathematical aspects of integrating fuzzy logic to model uncertainties and nonlinear dependencies in geoecological data, enabling transparent decision-making processes. As part of the research, a synthetic dataset was generated to enhance spatial modeling precision and address gaps in the existing data. This synthetic data, combined with the XAI framework, facilitated improved interpolation, leading to a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of pollutant distribution across different urban zones. The use of ANFIS allowed for the development of interpretable models that account for the spatial variability of pollutants and provide precise assessments of public health risks. The implementation of XAI further enhanced the transparency of inference processes and reduced uncertainty in predicting environmental risks, which is crucial for developing robust and effective environmental management strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The integration of human knowledge and experience with artificial intelligence, especially in the context of Industry5.0, holds the promise of advanced capabilities for manufacturing that may facilitate reduced waste and increased efficiency. However, there is a gap between the two. This work discusses the critical role of Explainable AI (XAI) within this paradigm, fostering a collaborative environment where human operators can leverage AI-driven insights. A framework for data-driven proactive quality control is coupled with XAI and human-centric approaches to enable a path towards zero-defect manufacturing processes, improved operational efficiency, and enhanced workforce empowerment. Furthermore, practical implications, the impact of XAI and recommendations for upskilling and reskilling the manufacturing personnel are discussed with a focus on small and medium-sized enterprises. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The construction of accurate and interpretable predictive model for high abundance fishing ground is conducive to better sustainable fisheries production and carbon reduction. This article used refined statistical maps to visualize the spatial and temporal patterns of catch changes based on the 2014-2021 fishery statistics of the Japanese sardine Sardinops melanostictus fishery in the Northwest Pacific Ocean. Three models (XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost) and two variable importance visualization methods (model built-in (split) and SHAP methods) were used for comparative analysis to determine the optimal modeling and visualization strategies. Results: 1) From 2014 to 2021, the annual catch showed an overall increasing trend and peaked at 220,009.063 tons in 2021; the total monthly catch increased and then decreased, with a peak of 76, 033.4944 tons (July), and the catch was mainly concentrated in the regions of 39.5°-43°N and 146.75°-155.75°E; 2) Catboost model predicted better than LightGBM and XGBoost models, with the highest values of accuracy and F1-score, 73.8% and 75.31%, respectively; 3) the overall importance ranking of the model’s built-in method differed significantly from that in the SHAP method, and the overall importance ranking of the spatial variables in the SHAP method increased. Compared to the built-in method, the SHAP method informs the magnitude and direction of the influence of each variable at the global and local levels. The results of the research help us to select the optimal model and the optimal visualization method to construct a prediction model for the Japanese sardine fishing grounds in the Northwest Pacific Ocean, which will provide a scientific basis for the Japanese sardine fishery to achieve environmental and economically sustainable fishery development. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper delves into the critical realm of stock market prediction, exploring the innovative role of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Traditionally, stock market forecasting has faced challenges due to reliance on historical data and economic indicators, often resulting in limited accuracy. NLP, however, offers a transformative approach by analysing vast volumes of textual data from sources like news articles, social media, and financial reports. Through sentiment analysis, trend identification, and company health assessment, NLP uncovers valuable insights that influence stock prices. The paper reviews existing research methodologies, integrating NLP with machine learning and deep learning models to predict market trends and sentiments. It highlights NLP's strengths in analysing unstructured data, uncovering hidden relationships, and providing real-time insights. Despite its advantages, NLP faces limitations such as biases in training data and challenges in interpreting nuanced language. The paper concludes by proposing future directions like explainable AI and incorporating alternative data sources, emphasizing NLP's potential to revolutionize stock market prediction while acknowledging the need for integrated approaches in financial analysis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In cooperation with a medium-sized industrial partner, we developed and evaluated two ML-based approaches for quality control in glass bottle printing. Our first approach utilized various filters to suppress reflections, image quality metrics for image comparison, and supervised classification models, resulting in an accuracy of 84%. We used the ORB algorithm for image alignment and to estimate print rotations, which may indicate manufacturing anomalies. In our second approach, we fine-tuned pre-trained CNN models, which resulted in an accuracy of 87%. Utilizing Grad-CAM, an Explainable AI method, we localized and visualized frequently defective bottle print regions without explicitly training our models for this use case. These insights can be used to optimize the actual manufacturing process beyond classification. This paper also describes our general approach and the challenges we encountered in practice with data collection during ongoing production, unsupervised preselection, and labeling. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Several emerging technologies have substantially affected the scope and implementation of security testing. This includes the testing of cryptographic algorithm implementation, the security of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms, joint functional safety and security-related (IEC TR 63069) testing, security and privacy-related testing of big data and cloud computing, e.g. with regard to de-identification. This paper focuses on the security ML and AI implementations, examining their integration in industrial control and nuclear systems (IEC 62443). Special attention is given to security threats considered throughout the AI system life cycle specifically at design phase. We assess the entirety of the secure development lifecycle, which includes stages such as data and model management, risk assessment, and the enhancement of system robustness and resilience as specified by ISO/IEC 42001. To highlight the critical role of verification and validation (V&V), we conduct a proof-of-concept exploit targeted and gradual feature poisoning attack on a water treatment and distribution simulator fault detector. We achieve to demonstrate the impact of the attack on model robustness and performance through explainable metrics and pave the way for the development of a secure lifecycle framework, thereby increasing the chances of successful deployment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study addresses the escalating traffic congestion crisis in major Indian metropolises such as Mumbai, Pune, Delhi, and Bengaluru. Commuters in these cities experience daily travel times significantly higher than the average in other Asian cities, resulting in an annual economic loss of USD 22 billion, with 12% attributed to reduced productivity. The research proposes a novel approach leveraging social media and geospatial technologies to tackle this issue. By analyzing tweets from official city traffic police handles through the Twitter API and employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the study aims to extract location-specific information, conduct sentiment analysis, and visualize traffic hotspots on interactive maps. The resulting congestion map, accessible through online platforms or mobile apps, is expected to empower citizens with real-time information for optimized travel decisions. Authorities can utilize the identified hotspots and location-specific analysis for targeted interventions, including resource allocation, infrastructure improvements, and dynamic traffic signal management. Combining social media data with geospatial analysis, this integrated approach promises to offer a unique perspective on urban traffic dynamics, ultimately contributing to a more efficient, sustainable, and livable urban landscape in India. Additionally, the study delves into the application of text pattern analysis to identify correlations between specific locations and traffic infrastructure-related problems, providing a deeper understanding of the root causes of congestion. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper redefines the traditional view of automation as a threat to human labor, advocating for human-AI co-creation as a strategic imperative for organizations. We propose a comprehensive six-stage framework for co-creation, emphasizing iterative feedback loops and continuous improvement to integrate generative AI into workflows effectively. Drawing from a multi-disciplinary perspective, we explore critical enablers of successful human-AI collaboration, including user-centered interface design, explainable AI systems, and fostering a culture of trust and experimentation. Real-world case studies, such as AI-enhanced visual design and creative writing, illustrate the transformative potential of co-creation across various sectors. We also propose a multifaceted measurement framework encompassing quantitative metrics (e.g., productivity gains, time-to-market acceleration) and qualitative indicators (e.g., employee well-being, skill development) to assess the impact of co-creation comprehensively. This research offers a strategic roadmap for organizations to embrace generative AI as a tool for collaboration and augmentation, thereby unlocking new levels of creativity, productivity, and employee empowerment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Detecting bid-rigging in public procurement is crucial for identifying collusive behaviors in bidding activities. However, the well-accepted cartel-like detection methods based on machine learning are not efficient to identify complex relationships between features associated with collusive behaviors. Further, the detection methods based on deep learning are not competent at interpretability and transparency, which are critical to support decision-making to clarify why the transaction entities are announced to be bid-rigging. Addressing this gap, we propose a novel detection approach that enhances interpretability by integrating deep learning with case-based reasoning. Our deep learning model learns complex patterns and nonlinear relationships in the data, while case-based reasoning provides interpretability through analogies to previous cases. Evaluation on a Japanese public procurement dataset demonstrates that our method not only achieves superior performance but also ensures interpretability. This study is a new and practical attempt to apply deep learning to detect bid-rigging activities with explainable decisions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The modern financial industry demands rapid decision-making based on diverse information from dynamic environments. Predicting outcomes from such data is complex due to rapid shifts influenced by numerous factors. Despite advancements in artificial intelligence technology that offer sophisticated analytical models, accurately predicting outcomes and providing sufficient justification for these predictions remain challenging, particularly with fragmented model constructions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for efficient processing of available public personal credit data, deriving new analysis elements, and comparing prediction interpretations. Specifically, we develop 11 prediction models that can be categorized into two types: data image transformation and time-series transformation. The models undergo standardization, preprocessing, and cross-validation for optimization, with their predictive performances compared and validated. Models leveraging convolutional neural network (CNN) and convolutional neural network-long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) architectures demonstrate strong performance across both categories. To fully interpret the classification process, SHAP is applied to compare and explain the prediction results for each model type. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Additive manufacturing (AM), particularly with Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF), excels in fabricating intricate geometries and custom components through layer-by-layer deposition. However, precise control over melt pool geometry is crucial for ensuring high quality and performance. This study uses Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) regression techniques to manage melt pool geometry in AM processes. The primary goal is to evaluate these models' effectiveness in predicting and optimizing melt pool depth, width, and length using extensive datasets of process parameters and material properties. The models produced promising results. The best performance was for melt pool length, with an MSE of 0.0036, RMSE of 0.0600, MAE of 0.0300, and an R-squared score of 0.9456. Integrating these models into Multi-Objective Optimization Using Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) enhances real-time monitoring, control, and optimization of melt pool geometry during production. This approach leverages IoT-enabled capabilities within Industry 4.0 frameworks, improving decision-making and operational efficiency in AM. By providing interpretable AI predictions, this study aims to enhance the quality, reliability, and efficiency of AM processes, contributing to optimized production outcomes in digital manufacturing environments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - According to WHO, approximately 1.71 billion people worldwide have musculoskeletal conditions, which in- clude various issues such as intact muscles, bones, joints, and fractures. Among those, fractures are the most common. Due to the emergency nature of diagnosing fractures, there is a high chance of misdiagnosis for several reasons, such as the unavailability of radiologists, physicians' lack of experience, and other factors. Fracture diagnostic or X-ray interpretation errors can be reduced if radiographs are always read instantly by radiologists or automatically. In our study, we are focusing on automating wrist fracture diagnosis, where we are utilizing the publicly available GRAZPEDWRI-DX dataset, which consists of 20,327 wrist radiographs. We employed the YOLOv9 model for fracture detection, achieving an mAP@50 of 0.677, which surpasses previous benchmarks. For fracture classification, we trained several state-of-the-art deep learning models, including VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, EfficientNetB7, DenseNet121, MobileNet, and ConvNeXtXLarge. In particular, the YOLOv8-cls model surpassed all others in accuracy (0.93), precision (0.9352), and recall (0.8855), reaching its peak performance at epoch 70. To elucidate the decision-making process of both the detection and classification models, we generated explainable saliency maps through EigenCAM, making the models more explainable and interpretable. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Rice plays a vital role in the food stock. But sometimes this crop leaf falls into disease. And, the amount of food consumed will decrease due to leaf disease. So, discovering the rice leaf disease is necessary to improve rice productivity. Currently, many researchers use deep learning methods to solve this problem. Unfortunately, their research results were less accurate. In this paper, we construct transfer learning models to diagnose and categorize illnesses affecting rice leaves. To further improve the model performance, we construct three ensemble learning models to combine various architectures. In order to bring transparency to the disease diagnostic process, we explore the explainable AI (XAI) problem of the visual object detector and integrate Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad- CAM) into three ensemble models to generate explanations for individual object detections for assessing performance. The results of Ensemble Learning indicate that merging different architectures can be effective in disease diagnosis, as evidenced by their best accuracy of 99.78% which is better than other stateof- the-art works. This research demonstrates that the integration of deep learning and transfer learning models yields improved prediction interpretability and classification accuracy of rice leaf disease. So, we established a dependable method of deep, transfer, and ensemble learning for the diagnosis of diseases affecting rice leaves. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper proposes a Machine Learning (ML) approach to perform an Ahead-of-Time (AoT) prediction of decorated particleboard production disruptions and defects. We worked with a Portuguese company that is adopting the Industry 4.0 concept aiming to improve their decorated particleboard production planning (e.g., reducing production time and waste of materials). This company's business needs are addressed in terms of two nontrivial binary classification tasks (production disruptions and defects). The AoT prediction is achieved by using only input attributes available before the execution of the production process. To reduce the modeling effort, we focus on Automated ML (AutoML) methods, under two main approaches: Single-Target Classification (STC) and Multi-Target Classification (MTC). The former is achieved by adopting the popular H2O AutoML tool, while the latter adopts a deep learning neural network automatically tuned by using a Bayesian search. The computational experiments adopted a realistic rolling window evaluation over recently collected industrial data (comprising 14 months). Overall, interesting predictive results were achieved by both AutoML approaches, outperforming a baseline Decision Tree method. In addition, an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) method based on a Sensitivity Analysis (SA) was adopted, allowing the identification of the most relevant inputs, which is valuable knowledge to support the decorated particleboard production planning. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The construction industry is rapidly adopting Industry 4.0 technologies, creating new opportunities to address persistent environmental and operational challenges. This review focuses on how Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) are being leveraged to tackle these issues. It specifically explores AI’s role in predicting air pollution, improving material quality, monitoring worker health and safety, and enhancing Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) for construction. This study evaluates various AI and ML models, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines SVMs, as well as optimization techniques like whale and moth flame optimization. These tools are assessed for their ability to predict air pollutant levels, improve concrete quality, and monitor worker safety in real time. Research papers were also reviewed to understand AI’s application in predicting the compressive strength of materials like cement mortar, fly ash, and stabilized clay soil. The performance of these models is measured using metrics such as coefficient of determination (R2), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Furthermore, AI has shown promise in predicting and reducing emissions of air pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO<inf>2</inf>, CO, SO<inf>2</inf>, and O<inf>3</inf>. In addition, it improves construction material quality and ensures worker safety by monitoring health indicators like standing postures, electrocardiogram, and galvanic skin response. It is also concluded that AI technologies, including Explainable AI and Petri Nets, are also making advancements in CPS for the construction industry. The models’ performance metrics indicate they are well-suited for real-time construction operations. The study highlights the adaptability and effectiveness of these technologies in meeting current and future construction needs. However, gaps remain in certain areas of research, such as broader AI integration across diverse construction environments and the need for further validation of models in real-world applications. Finally, this research underscores the potential of AI and ML to revolutionize the construction industry by promoting sustainable practices, improving operational efficiency, and addressing safety concerns. It also provides a roadmap for future research, offering valuable insights for industry stakeholders interested in adopting AI technologies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This research leverages a comprehensive global weather database to validate the potential of short-term air quality predictions using minimal data. This approach is particularly promising for resource-limited environments, which are often more vulnerable to such hazards compared to developed nations. The study employs machine learning methodologies and incorporates meteorological, air pollutant, and Air Quality Index (AQI) features from 197 capital cities. Our findings underscore the efficacy of the Random Forest algorithm in generating reliable predictions, especially when applied to classification rather than regression. This approach enhances the generalizability of the model on unseen data by 42%, considering a cross-validation score of 0.38 for regression and 0.89 for classification. To instill confidence in these predictions, different methods for explainable machine learning were considered. This research highlights the potential for resource-limited countries to independently project short-term air quality while waiting for larger datasets to enhance their predictions. Implementing this approach could promote public health and reduce dependence on external entities. In conclusion, this study serves as a guiding light, paving the way towards accessible and explainable air quality forecasting. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In the aftermath of the devastating seismic event that struck Morocco in September 2023, resulting in the collapse of numerous fragile structures and a significant loss of human life, the urgency to strengthen disaster preparedness and response capabilities has never been more critical. This juncture provides a unique opportunity to leverage the transformative potential of cutting-edge technologies, particularly Artificial Intelligence (AI) with a specific emphasis on Explainable AI (XAI) methods. Concrete, being an essential construction material valued for its notable strength, durability, and versatility, sees extensive use in various infrastructure projects. However, the presence of concrete segregation presents a substantial challenge in both the construction and upkeep of concrete structures. Concrete segregation entails the uneven distribution of aggregates within the concrete matrix, which can lead to adverse effects. It jeopardizes structural integrity, diminishes performance, and potentially poses safety hazards. Given these significant concerns, it is imperative to identify and quantify instances of concrete segregation. In response to this requirement, the current investigation introduces a novel method for assessing concrete segregation using an image processing-based technique, incorporating Deep Learning and Explainable Artificial Intelligence. This research not only improves the precision and reliability of detecting concrete segregation but also ensures transparency in the decision-making process. This innovative approach has the potential to transform concrete construction and maintenance practices, ensuring the structural integrity and performance of infrastructure projects are upheld while minimizing safety risks linked to concrete segregation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - n order to accurately identify vehicle vibration and shaft torque oscillation (Shunt) phenomenon, this paper analyzes and supplements the definition of Shunt phenomenon and optimizes the label data set by combining the short-time Fourier transform method with the traditional vehicle as the carrier, and uses the decision tree, support vector machine and random forest algorithm to identify Shunt with the engine speed, transmission input shaft speed and other sensor signals as inputs. The results show that, compared with the traditional model construction method, this method reduces the difficulty and cost of model construction, and can be used for interpretable machine learning to explain the model. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years, fuzzy rule-based systems have been attracting great interest in interpretable and eXplainable Artificial Intelligence as ante-hoc methods. These systems represent knowledge that humans can easily understand, but since they are not interpretable per se, they must remain simple and understandable, and the rule base must have a compactness property. This article presents an algorithm for minimizing the fuzzy rule base, leveraging rough set theory and a greedy strategy. Reducing fuzzy rules simplifies the rule base, facilitating the construction of interpretable inference systems such as decision support and recommendation systems. Validation and comparison of the proposed methodology using both real and benchmark data yield encouraging results.

AB  - We propose an ontology-grounded approach to Knowledge Graph (KG) construction using Large Language Models (LLMs) on a knowledge base. An ontology is authored by generating Competency Questions (CQ) on knowledge base to discover knowledge scope, extracting relations from CQs, and attempt to replace equivalent relations by their counterpart in Wikidata. To ensure consistency and interpretability in the resulting KG, we ground generation of KG with the authored ontology based on extracted relations. Evaluation on benchmark datasets demonstrates competitive performance in knowledge graph construction task. Our work presents a promising direction for scalable KG construction pipeline with minimal human intervention, that yields high quality and human-interpretable KGs, which are interoperable with Wikidata semantics for potential knowledge base expansion. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Optimizing energy consumption in buildings stands as a pivotal concern in the face of escalating environmental challenges. To address this, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, specifically Model Predictive Control (MPC), has emerged as a promising approach. However, the lack of interpretability in AI-controlled systems hinders their widespread acceptance and trust. Addressing this challenge, Explainable AI (XAI) methodologies offer insights into AI decision processes, fostering comprehension and confidence. This research focuses on bridging this gap by proposing an Explainable AI framework for MPC systems for optimizing the battery charge state for residential buildings equipped with photovoltaic generation and onsite battery storage from the NeurIPS 2022 CityLearn Challenge dataset. The AI-based MPC aims to dynamically adjust the charge state of the battery to minimize the cost and carbon emissions from predicted future energy demands and solar generation, optimizing the battery's charge level accordingly. This study investigates the reliability of AI systems in building controls, aiming to align AI decision-making with user expectations. Through the application of XAI techniques, the study confirms that the AI model comprehends system features, enabling objective improvements and enhancing user confidence. This allows the MPC to not only optimize building energy consumption but also explain the decision-making process behind AI-controlled systems. The integration of Model Predictive Control with Explainable AI paves the way for sustainable and transparent energy management practices in the built environment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Research has shown that approximately 10% of medical diagnoses are wrong. As a direct consequence, appropriate medical treatment may be delayed or even absent, leading to an increased burden on patients, increased costs for medication, or even harm and death. As cognitive biases contribute to roughly three-quarters of these diagnostic errors, a lot can be gained from increasing a physician’s reasoning quality during the diagnostic process. Clinical decision support systems (CDSS), leveraging recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and insights from eXplainable AI (XAI), aim at providing accurate predictions and prognosis paired with corresponding ex-post explanations that make the reasoning of the system accessible to humans. Viewing explanations as involving the interactive construction of shared belief, we propose to move from diagnostic decision support to reasoning support which, in its true sense, needs to tailor the timing and content of generated explanations to the state of the reasoning process of physicians to meet their information needs and effectively mitigate the influence of cognitive biases. We claim that, given the uncertain and incomplete information inherent to medical diagnosis, the most effective way not to fall prey to cognitive reasoning errors is to establish and maintain proper justification for each decision throughout the diagnostic process. This paper contributes (1) a conceptual model and desiderata for AI-based interactive reasoning support that enhances reasoning quality through increased justification at every stage of the process, and (2) preliminary work on the development of the assistive, co-constructive differential diagnosis system, ASCODI, which provides reactive as well as proactive reasoning support to improve the justification of actions taken and decisions made during and after medical diagnosing. We also present selected use cases of ASCODI concerning its application in supporting the diagnosis of transient loss of consciousness and highlight their connection back to the theoretical concepts established. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Recent literature highlights the critical role of neighborhood construction in deriving model-agnostic explanations, with a growing trend toward deploying generative models to improve synthetic instance quality, especially for explaining text classifiers. These approaches overcome the challenges in neighborhood construction posed by the unstructured nature of texts, thereby improving the quality of explanations. However, the deployed generators are usually implemented via neural networks and lack inherent explainability, sparking arguments over the transparency of the explanation process itself. To address this limitation while preserving neighborhood quality, this paper introduces a probability-based editing method as an alternative to black-box text generators. This approach generates neighboring texts by implementing manipulations based on in-text contexts. Substituting the generator-based construction process with recur-sive probability-based editing, the resultant explanation method, XPROB (explainer with probability-based editing), exhibits com-petitive performance according to the evaluation conducted on two real-world datasets. Additionally, XPROB's fully transparent and more controllable construction process leads to superior stability compared to the generator-based explainers. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - As advertisers increasingly shift their budgets to-ward digital advertising, accurately forecasting advertising costs becomes essential for optimizing marketing campaign returns. This paper presents a comprehensive study that employs various time-series forecasting methods to predict daily average CPC in the online advertising market. We evaluate the performance of statistical models, machine learning techniques, and deep learning approaches, including the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT). Our findings reveal that incorporating multivariate models, enriched with covariates derived from competitors' CPC patterns through time-series clustering, significantly improves forecasting accuracy. We interpret the results by analyzing feature importance and temporal attention, demonstrating how the models leverage both the advertiser's data and insights from the competitive landscape. Additionally, our method proves robust during major market shifts, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, consistently outperforming models that rely solely on individual advertisers' data. This study introduces a scalable technique for selecting relevant covariates from a broad pool of advertisers, offering more accurate long-term forecasts and strategic insights into budget allocation and competitive dynamics in digital advertising. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A vital component of maintaining the world’s expanding populace is farming. In agriculture field, factors such as soil quality, weather patterns, and crop yields are essential components of usual possessions that affect farming manufacture. Despite advancements, prevailing smart systems quiet struggle with handling big amounts in prediction claims, often facing difficulties in balancing prediction accuracy and learning efficiency. To ensure sustainable food production, integrating advanced machineries such as machine learning and artificial intelligence in agriculture is essential. This study proposes an explainable AI (XAI)-based smart agriculture system to provide holistic recommendation for precision farming aimed at improving productivity while reducing environmental impact. We compiled a comprehensive weather, soil, and crop dataset from official and verified sources in India. From this dataset, we extracted and optimized features using pre-trained architectures and enhanced barnacles mating optimization (EBMO) algorithm, addressing the high-measure mentality and computational complexity issues often encountered in agricultural data analysis. The selected features were analyzed to provide holistic recommendations for precision farming using baseline ML models such as support vector machine, random forest, neural network, and decision tree. Additionally, we integrate the XAI framework with an interpretable recommendation/s for optimizing the agricultural practices. The study developed an XAI-based smart agriculture system that provides holistic recommendations for precision farming to boost productivity. By using a comprehensive dataset and optimizing features with the EBMO algorithm, the research achieved high accuracy in crop yield predictions, particularly with the XLNet+SVM model, which outperformed existing models across various crops. The integration of SHapley Additive explanation (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation (LIME) further enabled interpretable AI-driven insights, enhancing transparency in decision-making. The results demonstrated significant improvements in prediction accuracy, resource management, and sustainability, offering valuable contributions to global food security through smart agriculture. The ability to explain these AI decisions further supports the adoption of AI technologies in agriculture, fostering resilient agricultural systems that are essential for feeding the world’s growing population. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Compared to the generations up to 4G, whose main focus was on broadband and coverage aspects, 5G has expanded the scope of wireless cellular systems toward embracing two new types of connectivity: massive machine-type communications (mMTCs) and ultrareliable low-latency communications (URLLCs). This article discusses the possible evolution of these two types of connectivity within the umbrella of 6G wireless systems. This article consists of three parts. The first part deals with the connectivity for a massive number of devices. While mMTC research in 5G predominantly focuses on the problem of uncoordinated access in the uplink for a large number of devices, the traffic patterns in 6G may become more symmetric, leading to closed-loop massive connectivity. One of the drivers for this type of traffic pattern is distributed/decentralized learning and inference. The second part of this article discusses the evolution of wireless connectivity for critical services. While latency and reliability are tightly coupled in 5G, 6G will support a variety of safety-critical control applications with different types of timing requirements, as evidenced by the emergence of metrics related to information freshness and information value. In addition, ensuring ultrahigh reliability for safety-critical control applications requires modeling and estimation of the tail statistics of the wireless channel, queue length, and delay. The fulfillment of these stringent requirements calls for the development of novel artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques, incorporating optimization theory, explainable AI (XAI), generative AI, and digital twins (DTs). The third part analyzes the coexistence of massive connectivity and critical services. Specifically, we consider scenarios in which a massive number of devices need to support traffic patterns of mixed criticality. This is followed by a discussion about the management of wireless resources shared by services with different criticality. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The increasing demand for sustainable and efficient agricultural practices has driven the adoption of digital technologies in the sector. Despite the persistent lack of transparency in machine learning models, farmers often perceive smart agriculture solutions as complex and of limited value. To address this challenge, we present AgriUXE (Agricultural eXperience Enhanced through eXplainability), a digital platform that combines multimodal data with explainable artifical intelligence (XAI) techniques to provide user-adaptive explanations to drive decision-making processes in smart farming solutions. Given data collected from multimodal sources, such as Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensors and remote sensing, the platform intends to generate comprehensible insights and predictions tailored to the needs of different farm stakeholders. AgriUXE has the potential to integrate with various applications, including mixed reality and digital twin solutions, showcasing its ability to improve the overall farming experience through improved transparency, and decision-making. Additionally, this paper details the functionalities of AgriDash, a practical application for enhanced viticulture data collection, prediction, and visualization. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Analysis of mutual fund performance is crucial for fund managers and investors to make wise choices. Predictions made using traditional approaches are frequently not as accurate since they are unable to identify intricate patterns in financial data. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are two examples of deep learning approaches that provide promising ways to improve the predictive accuracy of financial forecasting jobs. Incorporating explainable AI techniques can also help with risk management and decision-making by offering insights into the fundamental causes influencing mutual fund performance. By utilizing the combined strength of explainable AI techniques and CNN-LSTM architecture, this work seeks to improve mutual fund performance analysis. The aim is to create a strong framework that can forecast mutual fund performance with accuracy and offer comprehensible explanations of the underlying elements. This work is interesting because it combines explainable AI methods which are particularly useful for analyzing mutual fund performance with CNN-LSTM architecture. In this work, the dual challenges of prediction accuracy and model transparency in financial forecasting are addressed by integrating deep learning with interpretability. The proposed framework for mutual fund performance analysis uses historical data, CNN-LSTM architecture, and explainable AI methods. The model outperforms traditional methods, achieving higher predictive accuracy and providing actionable insights into fund performance drivers. The model's interpretability enhances trustworthiness and utility for investors and fund managers, empowering stakeholders with better decision-making in dynamic financial markets. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Process and product fingerprints (FP) have been approved as effective parameters to reveal the principal contributing factors towards functionality in smart manufacturing processes. Though AI-driven methods outperform other approaches for fingerprint extraction, the lack of explainability in its black-box style predictions leads to misconceptions and trust issues among stakeholders. In this study, a novel explainable-AI (XAI) approach is proposed to identify mathematical fingerprint expressions by formulating them as graphs using the QLattice algorithm, inspired by path integral formulation. Here, the Qlattice model identifies explainable and human-comprehensible FP expressions for cobot dynamic error based on accelerometer signal features. The discovered symbolic model is subsequently applied to a digital twin which successfully tracked and compensated for dynamic errors autonomously in real time. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study addresses discerning causal relationships in complex systems, a key aspect of interpretable machine learning. It focuses on the unusual and intense early summer weather in South Asia during April and May 2022 that led to an increased number of forest fires. This work employs a Bayesian network (BN), constructed using the NOTEARS algorithm, to analyse the contribution of various land and atmospheric variables on the extent of burned areas. In a scenario analysis using peak values of 300-hPa meridional circulation index and 500-hPa Geopotential Height Anomalies, indicative of a strong atmospheric block, the likelihood of large burned areas (>3.06 log ha or >1150 ha) increases from 36.6% to 41.6%. This is due to a rise of conditional probabilities in the Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD) (> 5.21 kPa) by 24.8%, and the Land Surface Temperature (LST) (>45.7°C) by 15.6%. In addition, sensitivity and spatial analyses indicate that extreme dry conditions, characterized by high LST and VPD due to the trapping effects of the omega block jet stream pattern, were the primary factors influencing the extent of burned areas during the 2022 South Asia heatwave. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In electronic manufacturing industries, defects emerging from Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) may cause severe malfunctions of the final product. This paper aims to address this issue by proposing the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to detect common defects in PCB through the implementation of deep learning (DL) models. The paper utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their derived models, in particular, region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN), Fast R-CNN, and Faster R-CNN. Analysis of the utilization of these techniques in detecting common defects of the PCB, which are classified as missing hole, open circuit, short, spur and spurious circuit are performed in Google Colab platform using Python, with data retrieved from Kaggle. From the results obtained, the best performance parameters for color input for the defect classes are 95.3%, 83.2%, 89.7%, 85.6% and 82.7% respectively. To better understand the results obtained, explainable AI (XAI) techniques, LIME and Grad-CAM were utilized. The implemented technique successfully shows the decision logic for the defect classes through the interpretation images obtained. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Monitoring and forecasting the progress of information technology projects stands as a significant challenge in project management. Over the past two decades, agile project management has become a crucial factor influencing project success. Despite this, existing research has not presented a comprehensive model capable of predicting project outcomes based on agile features. In light of this, this study aims to develop a predictive model for information technology project outcomes using agility metrics. The results indicate that metrics related to teamwork and the team's capabilities, along with their collective experience, have the most significant impact on project success. The study employs the Decision Tree as an interpretable model to establish rules and predict project success. The accuracy of the model designed in this study is an impressive 97%, surpassing the accuracy of SVM at 71 % and KNN at 82%. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is in need for a framework that balances the opportunities it represents with its risks. But while there is a broad consensus on this, and public regulative initiatives are taken; there is far less knowledge about how these dilemmas/opportunities/risks are played out in practice. The interest into ethics in organisation driven by a discourse on “Trustworthy AI”; makes us wonder whether an ethical approach to AI in organisation is purposeful; or needs modification. We investigate this by viewing the development and use of AI as structuration of practices. The empirical material is our own development of an AI system. Using studies of ethics in moral engineering design; AI is a question of structuration processers with unintended consequences. It is a “slide” from ethics of virtue to ethics of benefit as corroborated by engineers/designers referring ethical dilemmas to managers and politicians. The EU framework of Trustworthy AI for designing and using more accountable AI systems - considering ethics; human autonomy; harm prevention; fairness etc., conflicts with contemporary construction organisations. We propose an extension of the EU guidelines. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Machine learning applications in fields such as financial accounting or the healthcare industry have to meet high transparency requirements for user acceptance and to meet the growing number of regulatory standards. Counterfactual explanations as a rather easy to interpret concept of local explanations combined with the generative power of Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and their ability to learn distributions of latent representations can offer information to fulfill the needs of machine learning experts and non-expert users at the same time. Most current studies leveraging the power of deep generative models for counterfactual generation focus on vision data. We focus on anomaly detection applications on real world tabular data in the two high-risk fields of financial accounting and healthcare. We give an overview on constructions of counterfactual explanations and a categorization of current approaches to produce counterfactual explanations. We are investigating supervised extensions of the VAE for simultaneous classification and counterfactual generation. Therefor we explore the connection between different approaches of probabilistic modelling and separability properties in latent space. We discuss their applicability to anomaly detection and evaluation criteria. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Agriculture is pivotal for the economy of a country as it is a major source of food, employment and raw materials. However, challenges such as diseases, soil degradation, and water scarcity persist. Technology adoption can address these issues, improving production and quality. Machine learning, a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI), enables prediction, classification, and automation in agriculture. It optimizes irrigation, fertilization, and crop selection, aiding decision-making for food security and crop management. This study proposes two robust machine learning architectures for classification and regression based on distinct datasets. Firstly, we delve into a crop recommendation dataset obtained from Kaggle, consisting of various input attributes such as the pH of the soil, temperature, humidity, and nutrient levels. Leveraging machine learning classification techniques such as Extra Tree Classifier (ETC), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), we suggest twenty-two different crops founded on these inputs. Through the use of K-fold cross-validation, Explainable AI (XAI) and feature engineering, we identify the best-performing model, with Random Forest coming out on top scoring an accuracy of 99.7% with precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix. Secondly, we investigate wheat yield prediction data snagged from the World Bank and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), covering the years 1992-2013 for Pakistan. Using Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) to tackle data restrictions, we gauge wheat production for 2014-2024 and forecast the 2025 yield using machine learning regression models. Once again, using hyper parameter tuning with K-fold cross-validation, Support Vector Regressor (SVR) stands out as the top-performing model, achieving an accuracy of 99.9% with R2 Score. Transparency and confidence in agricultural decision-making are increased when machine learning decisions are made comprehensible using Explainable AI (XAI) approaches. Two widely used XAI approaches, namely Feature Importance and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) are used to interpret and explain outcomes of the proposed models. The study can increase agricultural productivity, minimize risks, enhance food security, and promote more environmentally friendly farming approaches. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has become increasingly vital in the field of artificial intelligence, as it addresses the critical need for transparency and interpretability in AI models. As AI systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes environments, understanding the decision-making process of these models is essential for building trust and ensuring responsible AI usage. XAI provides the methods to uncover the underlying mechanisms of AI models, making them more accessible and understandable to users and stakeholders. In the domain of software engineering, AI has emerged as a powerful tool for automating various tasks, including software defect prediction and cost estimation. However, the opaque nature of traditional AI models has raised concerns about their reliability and the ability to validate their outputs. This study focuses on enhancing the transparency of AI applications in software engineering by integrating XAI techniques. We employ a voting classifier trained on the KC2 dataset, coupled with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) for local and global explainability.

AB  - The construction industry is responsible for a substantial portion of final energy consumption (36%) and carbon dioxide emissions (39%), and this share is likely to rise as urbanization increases. This paper presents this model, which is based on HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems. Utilizing reinforcement learning (RL), one can ascertain the most efficient strategy to reduce HVAC energy usage while ensuring the thermal comfort of inhabitants. Because neural networks are complex and unpredictable, which impede the broad acceptance of artificial intelligence in the power industry. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is used to explain the decision-making process in deep reinforcement learning, HVAC systems are major energy users in buildings, and the switch to mixed ventilation modes has resulted in a more than 40% decrease in cooling device energy usage when compared to traditional methods. The energy transfer dynamics within HVAC systems can be delineated as a Markov Decision Process, with the objective of making informed choices across various states to maximize long-term benefits. The exploration of agents' behavioral policies can be enabled through the utilization of the Multi Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm (MADDPG). Experimental findings indicate that the RL-driven HVAC energy management approach is adept at adapting to diverse environmental conditions, effectively curbing energy usage, and enhancing comfort levels compared to conventional optimization control strategies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Under the national “double carbon” strategic goal, the low-carbon transformation of the railway field is imperative. As an important part of railway engineering, the carbon emission generated in the embodied stage is an important source of carbon emission in railway engineering. In order to quantify carbon emissions in the embodied stage of railway track engineering and realize intelligent analysis, this paper established a calculation model of carbon emissions in the embodied stage of railway track engineering, and it also proposed a model for predicting carbon emission and analyzing influencing factors based on machine learning algorithm. First, the research boundary of embodied stage was defined, the railway track engineering was decomposed, and the carbon emission factor method was used to establish the carbon emission calculation model with the main process as the basic accounting unit. Second, the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) was used to build a carbon emission prediction model. An interpretable machine learning model (SHAP) was introduced to analyze the contribution of influencing factors to carbon emissions. By taking a railway track project in a southwestern mountainous area as an example, a typical unit rail section was selected to calculate carbon emissions. The results shows that the total carbon emission of 1 km length is 1 290.94 t, and the carbon emissions of material production stage accounted for the largest proportion of about 87.21%. The carbon emissions of track-laying and roadbed are relatively high, which are 47.44% and 46.44%, respectively. The LIGTBM-SHAP model was verified by extracting relevant characteristics of carbon emissions from the track engineering as influencing factors. The numerical value of each evaluation index shows that the model has a good prediction effect, and the importance rank of influencing factors in descending order are track structure form, line section, sleeper type or track plate, construction days, section slope, and section transportation distance. In the analysis of results, the single factor feature dependence graph was used to clarify the impact of categorical variables or numerical changes of each influencing factor on carbon emissions. The research results provide a more intelligent and comprehensive research model for carbon emission calculation, prediction, and analysis of railway track engineering, and they also provide a reference for carbon emission reduction work in railway construction. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into Supply-Chain Management (SCM) has revolutionized operations, offering avenues for enhanced efficiency and decision-making. AI has become pivotal in tackling various Supply-Chain Management challenges, notably enhancing demand forecasting precision and automating warehouse operations for improved efficiency and error reduction. However, a critical debate arises concerning the choice between less accurate explainable models and more accurate yet unexplainable models in Supply-Chain Management applications. This paper explores this debate within the context of various Supply-Chain Management challenges and proposes a methodology for developing models tailored to different Supply-Chain Management problems. Drawing from academic research and modelling, the paper discusses the applications of AI in demand forecasting, inventory optimization, warehouse automation, transportation management, supply chain planning, supplier management, quality control, risk management, and customer service. Additionally, it examines the trade-offs between model interpretability and accuracy, highlighting the need for a nuanced approach. The proposed methodology advocates for the development of explainable models for tasks where interpretability is crucial, such as risk management and supplier selection, while leveraging unexplainable models for tasks prioritizing accuracy, like demand forecasting and predictive maintenance. Through this approach, stakeholders gain insights into Supply-Chain Management processes, fostering better decision-making and accountability. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The integration of renewable energy sources into power grids necessitates advanced fault ride-through (FRT) strategies. This paper proposes a comprehensive approach to address this need by combining Digital Twin (DT) modeling, eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) for islanding detection, and adaptive FRT methodologies in a grid-connected system with a Voltage Source Converter (VSC). The system operates in both grid-forming and grid-following modes, with a passive damping technique to enhance stability. The DT model encompasses plant modeling, Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) stage, and closed-loop virtual control crucial for islanding detection and dynamic response. XAI is employed for efficient classification using voltage magnitude, frequency, phase angle, and current. The FRT strategy ensures seamless transition from grid-connected to islanded operation, maintaining uninterrupted power supply and stability. Rigorous testing demonstrates the robustness of the DT model, emphasizing its contribution to intelligent control strategies in power systems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: The agricultural sector in many South Asian countries, including Bangladesh and India, plays a pivotal role in the economy, with a significant portion of the population dependent on it for livelihood. However, farmers often encounter challenges such as unpredictable weather conditions, soil variability, and natural disasters like floods and erosion, leading to substantial crop losses and financial strain. Despite government subsidies, many farmers struggle to sustain their livelihoods, resulting in a decline in interest in agriculture. Our focus lies on predicting the classification of various crops, including rice, jute, maize, and others, based on a combination of soil and weather features. Soil features, including Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, and pH levels, along with weather variables such as Temperature, Humidity, and Rainfall, are utilized as inputs for the predictive model. Methods: In this study, we address the critical issue of crop prediction by leveraging advanced machine-learning techniques and integrating genetic algorithms into the predictive model. Our proposed approach employs a hybrid methodology, where a Genetic Algorithm is utilized to optimize the hyperparameters of the model, enhancing its performance and robustness. Specifically, we employ a Random Forest classifier, a powerful ensemble learning technique, to classify the class labels associated with 22 different types of crops. Findings: The model’s accuracy is evaluated extensively, demonstrating a remarkable accuracy rate of 99.3%. Additionally, we utilized Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explaination(LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations(SHAP) Explainable AI (XAI) methods to interpret and validate the model’s predictions. Novelty: The study presents a unique method for crop prediction that combines machine learning (ML) with genetic algorithms (GAs). The goal of this integration is to improve crop forecast models’ interpretability and accuracy. Due to the nature of local approximation LIME may yield contradictory answers. On the other hand, for sophisticated models and extensive datasets, SHAP can be computationally costly. By improving feature selection and model parameters, the integration of GAs with ML models overcomes these drawbacks and produces predictions that are more reliable and accurate. The high accuracy achieved by our system underscores its potential to mitigate crop losses and enhance agricultural productivity, thereby contributing to the sustainability and prosperity of the agricultural sector in any country. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study draws inspiration from successful applications in biomedical data analysis, where guiding neural networks (NNs) with domain knowledge has proven effective in enhancing model performance through the integration of expert-derived representations [3]. While existing models in this domain excel in interpretability by aligning learned features with established domain expertise, our proposed method takes a unique approach. We introduce a novel domain knowledge-guided deep neural network that goes beyond the conventional application of domain knowledge. This pioneering effort seamlessly integrates domain knowledge into neural networks specifically designed for radio propagation modeling. The approach aims to enhance interpretability in this context, presenting a promising avenue for advancing the understanding and performance of neural networks in wireless communication scenarios. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Precision agriculture practices involve deploying the sensors in agricultural farms, to collect data about various factors responsible for crop growth and development. Recently this sensor data is used for generating a virtual replica of the corresponding agricultural physical asset (crop, farm, etc.) called the digital twin (DT). The DT primarily collects data about the current state of a physical asset through sensors. A Deep Learning (DL) model underlying a DT processes this data and generates recommendations. The DL algorithms are, however, often perceived as 'black-boxes', which has led to the development of eXplainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approaches. Also, the DL algorithms are limited to generating predictions based on the past data, which can be easily countered by the real-time change tracking capability of the DTs. Therefore, in this work we propose a novel framework of eXplainable Digital Twins (XDTs), which leverages the strengths of both XAI for DL algorithms and the real-time responsiveness of the DTs. Further, we feel that DL algorithms requires huge volumes of data for training and model development. In agricultural domain, where a number of domain experts (like, a farmer has lots of experience about crops, etc.) are involved, we feel this data hungriness limitation of the DL models can be removed by complementing the sensor data with qualitative inputs of the domain experts. Therefore, we also propose (a possible framework) Enhanced XDTs (EXDTs), which use the domain experts' qualitative data, satellite & meteorological data as well as the generated explanations from the XDTs to generate (better) explanations and also suggest necessary state changes to the corresponding agricultural physical asset. We feel our proposed framework is useful for the involved stakeholders in precision agriculture and can be used in other domains as well. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In the dynamic landscape of industrial operations, ensuring machines operate without interruption is crucial for maintaining optimal productivity levels. To avoid unexpected equipment failures, minimize downtime, and improve operational efficiency, estimating the Remaining Useful Life is very important in Predictive Maintenance. Survival analysis is a beneficial approach in this context due to its power of handling censored data (here referred to industrial assets that have not experienced a failure during the study period). Recently, with a big increase in the amount of recorded data, Machine Learning Survival models have been developed to find more complex patterns in predicting failure. However, the black-box nature of these models requires the use of explainable AI for greater transparency and interpretability. In this paper, we evaluate three Machine Learning-based Survival Analysis methods (Random Survival Forest, Gradient Boosting Survival Analysis, and Survival Support vector machine) and a traditional Survival Analysis model (Cox Proportional Hazards) using real-world data from SCANIA AB that includes 90% censored data. Results indicate that Random Survival Forest outperforms other models. In addition, we employ SHAP analysis to provide global and local explanations, highlighting the importance and interaction of features in our best-performing model. To overcome the limitation of applying SHAP on survival output, we utilize a surrogate model. Finally, SHAP identifies specific influential features, shedding light on their effects and interactions. This methodology tackles the inherent black-box nature of machine learning-based survival analysis models, providing valuable insights into their predictions. The findings from our SHAP analysis confirm the pivotal role of these identified features and their interactions, thereby enriching our comprehension of the factors influencing Remaining Useful Life predictions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The melting properties of energetic compounds are critical to their performances, but challenges persist in understanding the molecular features and design strategies that drive these properties. Integrating domain knowledge into data-driven approaches for predicting melting properties enhances the generation of comprehensive insights and enables the construction of interpretable prediction models. For this purpose, a knowledge-infused molecular graphs (KIMGs) were devised to describe the characters of energetic compounds, by which prediction models were developed in conjunction with the message passing neural networks. A melting-point dataset composed of around 30,000 melt-castable energetic compounds was constructed, and a collection of 29 key descriptors relevant to melting behaviors is integrated in KIMGs. The model achieved the best mean absolute error of 10.93 K for the melting point prediction. The model interpretability from both molecular graphs and feature importances offer insights for understanding the complex interplay that determine the melting properties of energetic compounds. This work enables researchers not only to predict melting behaviors with enhanced accuracy but also applicable to establishing other quantitively structure-property relationships. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The escalating incidence of diabetes in globe has prompted the medical sector to explore innovative approaches aimed at enhancing their medical technologies. Integrating machine learning (ML) algorithms into clinical care can play a pivotal role in early diabetes detection, thus helping to mitigate the potential health complications associated with the condition. Moreover, the latest Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques have the potential to facilitate user understanding and trust in AI-driven decisions. This work proposes a method for the precise detection of diabetes through meticulous data preprocessing, the construction of an ensemble ML algorithm and the interpretation of the model's outcomes using XAI. Early detection of diabetes enables timely intervention through medication, dietary adjustments, and lifestyle modifications, leading to improved blood sugar regulation and reduced risk of diabetes-related complications. The proposed work uses preprocessing techniques like K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation, One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) anomaly detection, Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique and Edited Nearest Neighbour (SMOTE + ENN) data balancing technique, and ensemble model has KNN, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGB) as baseline models and Random Forest (RF) as meta classifier. This research underscores the importance of building a reliable model for diabetes prediction and interpreting the results using the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanation (LIME) technique. This work addresses challenges such as missing data, anomalies, data imbalance, and appropriate model selection, while highlighting the significance of comprehending the model's outcomes. The proposed ensemble model achieved an accuracy of 97%. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The manufacturing industry is experiencing a significant transformation driven by digital technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) -based solutions. As manufacturers aim to boost productivity while maintaining human involvement, integrating robots poses new challenges. Emerging technologies like brain-machine interfaces and advanced AI are essential, leading to a new paradigm known as Industry 5.0 [1]. Industry 4.0 revolutionized manufacturing with AI, the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, cyber-physical systems (CPSs), and cognitive computing, creating "smart" environments where interconnected machines autonomously optimize production. This shift has significantly increased productivity and performance. However, Industry 5.0 further evolves by emphasizing collaboration between humans and robots, leveraging human creativity and advanced machinery. It aims to enhance efficiency and enable mass personalization, where products are tailored to individual needs. The core value of Industry 5.0 is human centricity, with machines handling repetitive tasks and humans focusing on cognitive and critical thinking tasks [2]. On the one hand and according to [3], the key technologies supporting a human-centric AI in manufacturing include i) Active Learning (AL): AI systems continuously learn from human feedback, enhancing human-machine synergy; ii) Explainable AI (XAI): Ensures AI decisions are transparent and understandable, fostering trust and collaboration; iii) Simulated Reality: Uses virtual environments to simulate real-world scenarios for training and decision-making; iv) Conversational Interfaces: Enable natural language interactions between humans and machines, improving usability; v) Security: Ensures data and system security as digitalization increases the attack surface. On the other hand and within this transformation, object detection (OD) plays a crucial role [4] by applying it in different systems like defect detection for quality control, in collaborative robots (cobots), with robot arms for palletising and pick and place automated system, and in video surveillance systems. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning, that the most recent development of these systems is based on YOLO detectors for their precision and inference speed efficiency trade-off [5]. In eastern Canada, the lobster fishery industry is the most commercially important fishery in Atlantic Canada [6, 7]. Integrating cutting-edge techniques and technologies within New Brunswick lobster manufacturers is crucial to match the industrial development era. To this end, a large lobster parts detection dataset has been collected by the R.E.I.4.0 laboratory at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Moncton. It includes several thousand color and grayscale images of lobsters collected in a context simulating an industrial environment [8]. All collected images have been annotated into six classes: Tail, claw, head, body, force claw, and folded tail, with their corresponding bounding box coordinates. The dataset also contains images without the lobster or its parts appearing (background). Thus, we propose a new YOLO-based lobster part detection system by exploiting an AL approach. Considering a limited label budget, AL aims to select the most effective images to be annotated to improve the model efficiency by applying a selection-based metric for N cycles until the label budget is reached. While AL is an annotation cost optimization-based machine learning approach, it is still underexploited and applied in OD. Three main selection categories exist in the general literature: Those based on the informativeness of samples, representativeness, and hybrid approaches [9]. In this work, we first evaluate the uncertainty selection metric based on entropy with the latest YOLO series update, i.e. YOLOv10 [10]. This detector presents the best holistic inference speed-accuracy performance for real-time detection. The initial active YOLOv10 training cycle used 0.5% randomly selected annotated data; then, 4 active cycles were carried out with an increment of 0.5%. The label quota budget is 2.5%, representing about 500 annotated images from the training dataset. For evaluation, we used a noisy version of the test set, simulating adverse industrial environment conditions, such as the addition of blur, and textures simulating the effect of water on images, reflections, and more severe intensity variations compared to the original images. The preliminary mAP50 result of active YOLOv10 compared to YOLOv10 trained from scratch and fine-tuned from the COCO trained model, when using a 2.5% random annotated image, are very competitive with 0.778, 0.802, and 0.831, respectively. Indeed, the entropy calculation only considers the prediction score. However, the consistency and reliability of the predicted bounding boxes should also be considered in the strategy applied to object detection systems. This is the primary objective of our ongoing experiments. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Employee performance evaluation is essential in human resource management, but existing systems are typically subjective and inefficient, resulting in skewed results and employee dissatisfaction. The paper addresses these limitations by introducing an AI-powered employee performance rating system. The system uses data-driven insights and powerful algorithms to provide objective assessments, improving objectivity, fairness, and efficiency in the review process. The proposed system provides real-time feedback and insights by combining extensive data collection and integration, Machine learning (ML) model selection, NLP analysis, and explainable AI methodologies, allowing HR managers to make educated decisions and successfully support employee development. The results and analysis show that the AI-powered system outperforms conventional approaches, with accuracy values ranging from 0.78 to 0.85, precision values from 0.79 to 0.86, and recall values ranging from 0.76 to 0.84. These results demonstrate AI technology's potential to promote organizational success by improving performance evaluation systems, encouraging staff development, and gaining a competitive advantage in the marketplace. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cauliflower cultivation is subject to high-quality control criteria during sales, which underlines the importance of accurate harvest timing. Using time series data for plant phenotyping can provide insights into the dynamic development of cauliflower and allow more accurate predictions of when the crop is ready for harvest than single-time observations. However, data acquisition on a daily or weekly basis is resource-intensive, making selection of acquisition days highly important. We investigate which data acquisition days and development stages positively affect the model accuracy to get insights into prediction-relevant observation days and aid future data acquisition planning. We analyze harvest-readiness using the cauliflower image time series of the GrowliFlower dataset. We use an adjusted ResNet18 classification model, including positional encoding of the data acquisition dates to add implicit information about development. The explainable machine learning approach GroupSHAP analyzes time points' contributions. Time points with the lowest mean absolute contribution are excluded from the time series to determine their effect on model accuracy. Using image time series rather than single time points, we achieve an increase in accuracy of 4%. GroupSHAP allows the selection of time points that positively affect the model accuracy. By using seven selected time points instead of all 11 ones, the accuracy improves by an additional 4%, resulting in an overall accuracy of 89.3%. The selection of time points may therefore lead to a reduction in data collection in the future. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Multivariate time series have had many applications in areas from healthcare and finance to meteorology and life sciences. Although deep neural networks have shown excellent predictive performance for time series, they have been criticised for being non-interpretable. Neural Additive Models, however, are known to be fully-interpretable by construction, but may achieve far lower predictive performance than deep networks when applied to time series. This paper introduces FocusLearn, a fully-interpretable modular neural network capable of matching or surpassing the predictive performance of deep networks trained on multivariate time series. In FocusLearn, a recurrent neural network learns the temporal dependencies in the data, while a multi-headed attention layer learns to weight selected features while also suppressing redundant features. Modular neural networks are then trained in parallel and independently, one for each selected feature. This modular approach allows the user to inspect how features influence outcomes in the exact same way as with additive models. Experimental results show that this new approach outperforms additive models in both regression and classification of time series tasks, achieving predictive performance that is comparable to state-of-the-art, non-interpretable deep networks applied to time series. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Identity verification at water and land borders constitutes a great challenge for Border Authorities and relevant technology providers due to the continuous variability and complexity of the border crossing points. In the meantime, identity fraud continuously evolves requiring novel mechanisms for secure and seamless identity verification. ODYSSEUS introduces a set of novel biometric-based mechanisms that will allow EU citizens that are or not part of the Schengen area to cross the borders across the Member States in a secure and frictionless manner. Seamless identity verification based on facial biometric will perform 1:N matching without requiring from the user to stop at the border. A novel Digital and Virtual passport will allow EU citizens to verify their identity through a mobile wallet, which will be protected through AI-powered continuous behavioural authentication. Each of the technologies will be explained through X-AI for improved result interpretation and reasoning, while the results of each of the technologies will be fused through the Decision Support System (DSS) into an overall identity risk score provided to the Border Authorities. A faceless person counting component will allow Border Authorities to further predict potential queues at the border crossing points and perform relevant adjustments. The platform will be validated in water and land Schengen borders showcasing the increase in productivity and reduction of queues at the borders. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - We synthesize the extended linear beta regression with a neural network structure to model and predict the mean and precision of market-based loss rates. We can incorporate non-linearity in mean and precision in a flexible way and resolve the problem of specifying the underlying form in advance. As a novelty, we can show that the proportion of non-linearity for the mean estimates is 14.10% and 80.37% for the precision estimates. This implies that especially the shape of the loss rate distribution entails a large amount of non-linearity and, thus, our approach consistently outperforms its linear counterpart. Furthermore, we derive trainable activation functions to allow a data-driven estimation of their shape. This is important if predictions have to be in a certain interval, e.g., (0, 1) or (0,∞). Conducting a scenario analysis, we observe that our estimated distributions are more refined compared to traditional models, thereby demonstrating their suitability for risk management purposes. These estimated distributions can assist financial institutions in better identifying diverse risk profiles among their creditors and across various macroeconomic states. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Elderly patients are more likely to suffer from severe ischemic stroke (IS) and have worse outcomes, including death and disability. We aimed to develop and validate predictive models using novel machine learning algorithms for the 3-month mortality in elderly patients with IS admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study. Data were extracted from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV and International Stroke Perfusion Imaging Registry (INSPIRE) database. Ten machine learning algorithms including Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network (NN), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNNs), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Naive Bayes (NB), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Logistic Regression (LR) were used to build the models. Performance was measured using area under the curve (AUC) and accuracy. Finally, interpretable machine learning (IML) models presenting as Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) values were applied for mortality risk prediction. Results: A total of 1826 elderly patients with IS admitted to the ICU were included in the analysis, of whom 624 (34.2%) died, and endovascular treatment was performed in 244 patients. After feature selection, a total of eight variables, including minimum Glasgow Coma Scale values, albumin, lactate dehydrogenase, age, alkaline phosphatase, body mass index, platelets, and types of surgery, were finally used for model construction. The AUCs of the CatBoost model were 0.737 in the testing set and 0.709 in the external validation set. The Brier scores in the training set and testing set were 0.12 and 0.21, respectively. The IML of the CatBoost model was performed based on the SHAP value and the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations method. Conclusion: The CatBoost model had the best predictive performance for predicting mortality in elderly patients with IS admitted to the ICU. The IML model would further aid in clinical decision-making and timely healthcare services by the early identification of high-risk patients. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Digital twin models are of high interest to Head and Neck Cancer (HNC) oncologists, who have to navigate a series of complex treatment decisions that weigh the efficacy of tumor control against toxicity and mortality risks. Evaluating individual risk profiles necessitates a deeper understanding of the interplay between different factors such as patient health, spatial tumor location and spread, and risk of subsequent toxicities that can not be adequately captured through simple heuristics. To support clinicians in better understanding tradeoffs when deciding on treatment courses, we developed DITTO, a digital-twin and visual computing system that allows clinicians to analyze detailed risk profiles for each patient, and decide on a treatment plan. DITTO relies on a sequential Deep Reinforcement Learning digital twin (DT) to deliver personalized risk of both long-term and short-term disease outcome and toxicity risk for HNC patients. Based on a participatory collaborative design alongside oncologists, we also implement several visual explainability methods to promote clinical trust and encourage healthy skepticism when using our system. We evaluate the efficacy of DITTO through quantitative evaluation of performance and case studies with qualitative feedback. Finally, we discuss design lessons for developing clinical visual XAI applications for clinical end users. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - We explore the potential of machine learning (ML) models applied in two financial risk management areas, i.e., credit risk management and financial risk hedging, through two practical use cases. This comparative study starts with the issue of explainability in complex ML models used in peer-to-peer lending for credit risk management. The first use case examines the limitations of using Kernel-SHAP with dependent features and evaluates different methods for estimating these dependencies using the Lending Club dataset. Our results suggest that accounting for feature dependence improves the understanding and robustness of prediction explanations. The second use case investigates a dynamic method for hedging foreign exchange risk in international equity portfolios, emphasizing the importance of accurate forecasts of currency returns. The analysis demonstrates that predictions yielded by ML models can significantly enhance the hedging of portfolios against currency risk. These findings highlight the transformative potential of advanced ML models in financial risk management, showcasing their capability to improve financial risk measurement and management. Further, our study outlines future research directions to advance this field. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Graph Neural Network (GNN) has demonstrated significant application potential in fields such as bioinformatics, social network analysis, and financial risk management. However, explainability issues have limited their widespread adoption. Although numerous explanatory models have been developed, as the range of application scenarios expands, there is still an increasing need for diverse explanations. However, current explanatory models struggle to meet the varying requirements of different scenarios. They are often tailored for specific objectives, compromising their adaptability to diverse explanatory needs. Additionally, current models commonly use instance-level explanations that mainly analyze single graph samples for structural features, leading to a focus on local information and neglect of broader global patterns and trends. To address these issues, this paper proposes the Multi-Objective Graph Neural Network Explanatory model (MOE). MOE utilizes a Pareto frontier-based strategy for exploratory subgraphs to harmonize and support multiple explanatory objectives. Additionally, MOE integrates both local and global information from the original data into each explanation, enhancing the explanatory depth. Empirical studies demonstrate that MOE excels in various datasets and explanatory tasks, significantly advancing GNN explainability. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - As artificial intelligence rapidly advance, their growing complexity enables more sophisticated applications across sectors, including construction. However, the opaque nature of algorithms, such as generative AI, reduces human interpretability and trust. While providing benefits like enhanced efficiency, generative design’s black-box processes hamper adoption. Explainable AI can elucidate how AI algorithms generate outputs, thereby improving understanding and confidence. Despite explainable AI’s potential, construction has given it limited focus. This research systematically reviews the application of explainable AI in generative design in construction, with an aim to allay risks and enable wider utilization of these emerging technologies for improved engineering design. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) is positioned to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of telecommunications networks through open interfaces and virtualization, allowing interoperability between different vendors. As a key departure from single-operator managed RAN, a remote RAN intelligence controller (RIC) queries the gNB for the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that are required for making RAN control decisions, often leveraging advanced machine learning (ML) models. However, this repeated querying increases control traffic overhead on the so called E2 interface connecting the gNB to the RIC. To address this challenge, we utilize a method from Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), specifically SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), which quantifies the contribution of each requested KPI to a model's prediction. Furthermore, we explore two different methods of choosing the most discriminative KPIs influencing model's performance, so that a smaller subset of KPIs may be queried, thus lowering the overhead on the E2 interface. Our analysis reveals that a model trained for the task of traffic classification using as input only the fraction of the top contributing KPIs identified by SHAP reduces control traffic overhead by up to 33% with only 7% reduction in ML classification accuracy. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) project fosters an enhanced, public understanding of the human presence on Earth. A decade after its inception in the Digital Earth 2020 vision, GHSL is an established project of the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre and an integral part of the Copernicus Emergency Management Service. The 2023 GHSL edition, a result of rigorous research on Earth Observation data and population censuses, contributes significantly to understanding worldwide human settlements. It introduces new elements like 10-m-resolution, sub-pixel estimation of built-up surfaces, global building height and volume estimates, and a classification of residential and non-residential areas, improving population density grids. This paper evaluates GHSL’s key components, including the Symbolic Machine Learning approach, using novel reference data. These data enable a comparative assessment of GHSL model predictions on the evolution of built-up surface, building heights, and resident population. Empirical evidence suggests that GHSL estimates are the most accurate in the public domain today (e.g. IoU 0.98 water class, 0.92 built-up class, 0.8 non-residential class, 6% MAE for the 100 m built-up surface or 2.27 m MAE for the building height, 83% TAA for resident population). The paper consolidates GHSL’s theoretical foundation and highlights its innovative features for transparent Artificial Intelligence, facilitating international decision-making processes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Almost all sensors suffer from some level of uncer-tainty introduced from production inaccuracies. When the sensor data is processed by machine learning, quantifying the impact of such production inaccuracies on the output of the machine learning model becomes difficult. Certain neural network architectures, such as continuous feature networks, allow individual features and data to be omitted while still being able to correctly predict the result without the need for retraining. Such features can, for example, be individual channels of a sensor. This article proposes a method to use the capability to omit arbitrary features or sensor channels to calculate Shapley values for each sensor channel. These Shapley values represent the contribution of each individual channel to the measurement. They are defined using an arbitrary function called the 'value function'. If the value function is defined as the error of the current measurement, the Shapley values will represent the contribution of each sensor channel to the error of the measurement result. By calculating Shapley values like this for a large unlabelled dataset of measurements, it is possible to understand how much measurement error was introduced by which channel of which sensor in each measurement. Averaging the Shapley values for each sensor in the dataset will then result in a metric for each channel of that sensor, which represents a contribution to measurement errors. By comparing these values to any arbitrary quality metrics for the sensor channels obtained in a calibration process or similar step, it is possible to correlate and quantify which value in the quality metric will cause how much of a measurement error, or whether the quality metric is even relevant for the measurement accuracy. This article will show the efficacy and use case of the method on an example of the production and quality control of optical sensors based on multiple spatially resolved reflection spectroscopy. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Concrete architectural structures are widely used in urban construction, making the health diagnosis and maintenance of these structures increasingly essential and urgent. Crack identification is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and safety of buildings. Traditional methods rely on manual inspection, which is plagued by low accuracy, inefficiency, and safety hazards. This paper proposes a technique combining an attention-based SqueezeNet network with Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) for automatically recognizing and visually explaining building cracks. By integrating the Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) attention mechanism with the lightweight SqueezeNet network, this method can adaptively adjust the importance of feature channels by learning global information, effectively improving the network's accuracy and efficiency. The experimental results show that the Att-SqueezeNet model achieved a high precision of 0.995, a training time of only 133 seconds, and a model size of 4.9M, significantly outperforming models such as SqueezeNet, RF, CNN, VGG-19, and B-CNN. This demonstrates its robustness, rapid identification and suitability for practical applications and building crack identification. Moreover, the utilization of Grad-CAM for visualization not only offers an intuitive explanation of the model's decision-making process but also provides a more comprehensible understanding of crack detection results. This is crucial for advancing building maintenance automation, reducing reliance on manual labor, and increasing the precision and reliability of detection tasks. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding the reasons behind a model's predictions is as important as achieving accurate results. The limited adoption of AI methods in fields like Energy and Industry is mainly attributed to a lack of trust, which is a crucial factor in user acceptance. Explainable AI is a recent approach to address this issue and enable the rapid deployment of AI in complex domains. This paper presents a framework for explainable anomaly detection and risk prognostics that utilizes an Ensembled Stacked Self-Supervised Model and Shapley additive approach to generate local and global explanations. The quality of the explanations is evaluated with the assistance of human experts to enhance model performance and streamline an automated online approach. The explanation produced is evaluated utilizing local accuracy metric. The proposed framework is tested on real-world industrial cooling system data, on which out of the ten anomalies identified, eight were successfully linked to maintenance actions, while two were attributed to random sensor measurement disturbances. This prognostic outcome establishes a new benchmark in the field. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Heart Failure (HF) poses a significant healthcare challenge, marked by escalating prevalence and profound impacts on patient well-being. While current diagnostic protocols rely pre-dominantly on clinical assessments, including electrocardiograms (ECG), echocardiograms, questionnaires, and blood tests, there exists a potential to enhance diagnostic precision through the integration of information from multiple modalities. This paper introduces an explainable multimodal data fusion strategy, which amalgamates electrocardiogram signals with carefully selected blood test results, aiming to refine heart failure detection. Utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for electrocardiogram classification and an XGBoost algorithm for blood test analysis, the research utilizes the MIMIC-IV database, including MIMIC-IV-ECG, and employs robust pre-processing methods to ensure data quality. The study explores late fusion techniques to effectively integrate electrocardiogram and blood test data. By examining feature importance scores, the research identifies key blood tests for further investigation. Notably, the late fusion approach achieves an impressive accuracy of 97.46%, accompanied by robust sensitivity (97.16%) and specificity (97.67%). These findings underscore the potential of multimodal fusion techniques in augmenting heart failure detection accuracy, with profound implications for enhancing patient care and outcomes. The study contributes to the advancement of diagnostic methodologies and underscores the pivotal role of leveraging diverse data modalities in medical diagnosis. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The energy industry has benefited the most from the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, particularly Machine Learning frameworks, for several purposes, such as assessing construction energy functionality. Nevertheless, the black-box models might end up in results that are difficult to human interpretability, making it impossible to use AI effectively in certain real-life circumstances. To improve the explanation of the system's findings, explainable AI (XAI) technologies may be successfully integrated into an AI-powered energy analysis approach. This study presents an XAI-based benchmarking system for predicting the membership to particular energy functioning categories of an extensive number of flattened energy-performance certifications (EPCs). Several black-box models with excellent accuracy are used to produce the categorization; however, their inference method is not accessible to humans. To further comprehend the model's conduct and the reasons behind both accurate and inaccurate categorizations, a universal XAI technique is used. This approach combines a regional explanation with a clustering technique for clarifying the outcomes of the model and the causal relationships between the predictions and the intended factor. The study offers a broad empirical strategy that can make utilization of a restricted number of examples to gather, clarify, and understand inference processes that the model has learned and finds valuable for the user. The system has been evaluated on around 100,000 EPCs of apartments in Italy. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Deep learning models have achieved high performance in medical applications, however, their adoption in clinical practice is hindered due to their black-box nature. Using explainable AI (XAI) in high-stake medical decisions could increase their usability in clinical settings. Self-explainable models, like prototype-based models, can be especially beneficial as they are interpretable by design. However, if the learnt prototypes are of low quality then the prototype-based models are as good as black-box. Having high quality prototypes is a pre-requisite for a truly interpretable model. In this work, we propose a prototype evaluation framework for Coherence (PEF-Coh) for quantitatively evaluating the quality of the prototypes based on domain knowledge. We show the use of PEF-Coh in the context of breast cancer prediction using mammography. Existing works on prototype-based models on breast cancer prediction using mammography have focused on improving the classification performance of prototype-based models compared to black-box models and have evaluated prototype quality through anecdotal evidence. We are the first to go beyond anecdotal evidence and evaluate the quality of the mammography prototypes systematically using our PEF-Coh. Specifically, we apply three state-of-the-art prototype-based models, ProtoPNet, BRAIxProtoPNet++ and PIP-Net on mammography images for breast cancer prediction and evaluate these models w.r.t. i) classification performance, and ii) quality of the prototypes, on three public datasets. Our results show that prototype-based models are competitive with black-box models in terms of classification performance, and achieve a higher score in detecting ROIs. However, the quality of the prototypes are not yet sufficient and can be improved in aspects of relevance, purity and learning a variety of prototypes. We call the XAI community to systematically evaluate the quality of the prototypes to check their true usability in high stake decisions and improve such models further. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years, neural networks have demonstrated their remarkable ability to discern intricate patterns and relationships from raw data. However, understanding the inner workings of these black box models remains challenging, yet crucial for high-stake decisions. Among the prominent approaches for explaining these black boxes are feature attribution methods, which assign relevance or contribution scores to each input variable for a model prediction. Despite the plethora of proposed techniques, ranging from gradient-based to backpropagation-based methods, a significant debate persists about which method to use. Various evaluation metrics have been proposed to assess the trustworthiness or robustness of their results. However, current research highlights disagreement among state-of-the-art methods in their explanations. Our work addresses this confusion by investigating the explanations’ fundamental and distributional behavior. Additionally, through a comprehensive simulation study, we illustrate the impact of common scaling and encoding techniques on the explanation quality, assess their efficacy across different effect sizes, and demonstrate the origin of inconsistency in rank-based evaluation metrics. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The great diffusion of convolutional neural networks and transformers for image classification made the demand for transparency of deep models more urgent, especially when the decisions involve delicate issues, such as the health of people. In this paper we present some metrics to evaluate the performances of visual explanations of AI classifiers compared to the annotations of expert practitioners. These metrics are used to evaluate whether the state-of-the-art deep models for X-ray image classification are capturing the right information and to identify the most effective methods in providing explanations from black-box models. Insights from this analysis, carried out on the most comprehensive dataset about thoracic diseases (ChestX-ray14), could help practitioners in understanding potentialities and limitations of deep models in computer-aided diagnosis. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Fuzzy cognitive maps and statistical reasoning are considered from the standpoint of explainable artificial intelligence. This approach means that today the artificial intelligence models should also be transparent, conceivable and have explanatory power for the users. We will consider how fuzzy cognitive maps may respond to these challenges because these maps provide a simple and conceivable method for modelling complex phenomena of the real world. Since their construction often stems from sophisticated machine learning and metaheuristic optimization methods as well as their concept values and interrelationships may base on subjective and ambiguous interpretations, we are still encountering problems in this sense. Our approach will apply statistical reasoning and theories, especially regression models, to fuzzy cognitive maps. Hence, we may avoid complex mathematical calculations and operate with objective, unambiguous and conceivable models, and in general, achieve better the aims of explainable artificial intelligence. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Explaining what does a data-driven control algorithm learns play a crucial role for safety critical control of autonomous platforms in transportation. This is more acute in reinforcement learning control algorithms, where the learned control policy depends on various factors that are hidden within the data. Explainable artificial intelligence methods have been used to explain the outcomes of machine learning methods by analysing input-output relations. However, data-driven control does not pose a simple input-output mapping and hence, the resulting explanations lack depth. To deal with this issue, this paper proposes a explainable data-driven control method that allows to understand what the data-driven method is learning from the data. The model is composed by a Q-learning algorithm enhanced by a dynamic mode decomposition with control (DMDc) algorithm for state-transition function estimation. Both the Q-learning and DMDc provides the elements that are learned from the data and allow the construction of counterfactual explanations. The proposed approach is robust and does not require hyperparameter tuning. Simulation experiments are conducted to observe the benefits and challenges of the method. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In the area of machine learning (ML) training data optimization through the construction of compact data, the focus of this paper is presented. The concept of compact data design, aimed at creating an optimized dataset that maximizes benefits without the need to manage a vast amount of complex data, is introduced. Improvements in the methods for optimizing ML training have been incorporated into the development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. The introduction of understanding ML training datasets as a facet of Explainable AI (XAI), comprehensible to humans, has been made. Among the methods of XAI, the evaluation of input feature importance stands out as a way to enhance the accuracy of complex ML models. The innovative method of compact data design for optimizing ML training through dataset reduction is proposed. The performance of an ML-based malware detection system, along with its variant utilizing compact data, has been assessed, demonstrating the maintenance of 99% accuracy. By applying a 76% reduced input dataset, the speed of ML training with the novel compact data design could be maximized, suggesting that an ML system trained in this manner could achieve statistically equivalent accuracy with only 57% of the original data sample size. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence development of the construction industry is its digitalization, which requires the transformation of processes and models based on the use of digital platforms and twins. However, complex dynamic environments with diverse data sources, inconsistency, or incompleteness undermine the reliability and usefulness of the explainable output. The proposed Random Forest (RF) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methodologies for effectively combining RF with ANN to capitalize on the strengths of both models in handling diverse data sources and capturing complex relationships. A mechanism is implemented to collect data from identified sources and integrate the process to scale and handle increasing data volumes and processing loads. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) account for measurement error in variables, making it more robust to measurement inaccuracies compared to simpler regression techniques. RF-ANN handle noisy or incomplete data and generalize patterns from training data to make predictions. Although proposed RF-ANN technique exhibits high performance compared to existing methods such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and Deep CNN (DCNN), the outcomes include a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 0.12, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.58, Accuracy of 0.9 and F1 value of 0.95 respectively. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Droughts typically develop gradually, and early prediction is crucial for the government to formulate effective mitigation plans. Our approach does not involve predicting specific drought index values. Instead, we forecast whether a particular year will experience drought. Insufficient investigation has been carried out regarding variations in additional climatic indicators like shortwave radiation, wind speed, sea level, and pollution in the context of droughts in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. In the study period taken from 1995 to 2020, only three years (2002, 2009, and 2017) experienced drought occurrences, resulting in an imbalanced dataset. To enhance the classification performance of this imbalanced dataset, a weighted dataset is constructed using a feature weighting approach known as the Single Objective Scorer (SOS) based Multi-objective PSO(MPSO) in conjunction with the Gradient Boosting Classifier. The proposed model facilitates objective-based multi-population formation and neighborhood learning. Precision and recall are crucial metrics, particularly in measuring imbalanced dataset classification performance. The application of multi-objective optimization techniques helps to strike a suitable balance between precision and recall. In addition to the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), 14 climatic indicators based on land, atmosphere, and sea are utilized. By employing the weighted dataset created with SOS-based MPSO, a significant improvement in recall value of 0.81 is achieved. Based on the weights assigned to the features, it is identified that the Mean Sea Level of the Arabian Sea and CO2 are significant indicators for predicting meteorological drought. The Explainable AI techniques SHAP and LIME are employed for interpreting the drought prediction model, providing insights into its workings. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Personal thermal comfort affects occupants' health, well-being, and productivity. Its satisfaction is subjective, based on individual characteristics and dynamic environments, and challenging to understand, requiring predicted outcomes and explanations of how and why the outcomes happen. This research fulfills this concern using a personal thermal comfort model based on causal artificial intelligence. It encodes personal thermal comfort satisfaction based on a new causal-and-effect framework to connect the human mind and environmental factors. Random variables encode relevant factors, and the structural causal model performs cause-and-effect relationships. The do-calculus (e.g., d-separated and d-connected) draws the common sense of the model based on causal structure representation, contributing to a human-intelligent understanding. A directed acyclic graph and exact-inference-based variable elimination quantify the model parameters based on real-world observational data. The strength of causal relationships is verified based on causal odd ratio, causal sensitivity, and causal impact. The results highlight that our proposed model can encode physiological and physical factors to predict and explain personal thermal comfort satisfaction. It can predict and explain such satisfaction reasonably and robustly, converging to human-like interpretation. It can be applied to intelligent systems to understand personal thermal comfort. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Plant diseases can have profound effects on the economy, impacting both local and global scales. These diseases can lead to substantial losses in agricultural productivity, affecting crop yields and quality. In this context, deep learning algorithms are widely acknowledged as effective solutions. However, the use of these black-box approaches raises concerns about trust in interpreting and validating the decisions generated by the models. This study proposes an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) based plant disease classification system to classify and identify distinct ailments with improved accuracy. The system correctly identifies 38 different plant diseases with accuracy, precision, and recall as 99.69%, 98.27%, and 98.26%, respectively. These predictions are subjected to additional analysis employing the local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) framework to produce visual explanations aligning with prior beliefs and adhering to established best practices in explanations. This system will serve as a promising avenue for revolutionizing disease detection, fostering informed decision-making, and ultimately contributing to global food security. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Grape is highly esteemed as a significant agricultural crop in Bangladesh. Plant diseases primarily result from the presence of pathogens and pest insects, leading to a significant decline in productivity if not properly addressed. The fundamental aim of this research is to employ a streamlined CNN-SVM architecture, utilizing deep learning techniques, to accurately categorize grape leaves into three distinct disease classes and one healthy class. The proposed model surpasses the accuracy of the previously trained transfer learning models VGG-16 and VGG-19 while having approximately 257× to 267× times fewer parameters (0.537 M). On average, the proposed model achieves a classification accuracy of 99.18%, which is significantly higher than the 93.42% and 91.94% achieved by the transfer learning models, respectively. With a precision, recall, and F1 score close to 99%, the suggested model provides excellent results. The model's outstanding performance is further validated by its remarkable Area Under Curve (AUC) score of 99.98%. In addition to using less disc space (about 6 MB), the suggested model because of being lightweight shows a significant decrease in parameters. To visually display the disease identified by the proposed model, a transparent AI methodology has been utilized, specifically the Gradient Weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) technique. To better understand which area was responsible for the classification, a heatmap has been created. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The control of credit risk is an important topic in the development of supply chain finance. Financial service providers should distinguish between low- and high-quality customers to predict credit risk accurately. Proper management of credit risk exposure contributes to the long-term viability and profitability of banks, systemic stability, and efficient capital allocation in the economy. Moreover, it benefits the development of supply chain finance. Supply chain finance offers convenient loan transactions that benefit all participants, including the buyer, supplier, and bank. However, poor credit risk management in supply chain finance may cause losses for finance providers and hamper the development of supply chain finance. Machine learning algorithms have significantly improved the accuracy of credit risk prediction systems in supply chain finance. However, their lack of interpretability or transparency makes decision-makers skeptical. Therefore, this study aims to improve AI transparency by ranking the importance of features influencing the decisions made by the system. This study identifies two effective algorithms, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models, for credit risk detection. The factors that influenced the decision of the models to make them transparent are explicitly illustrated. This study also contributes to the literature on explainable credit risk detection for supply chain finance and provides practical implications for financial institutions to inform decision making. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - We introduce the concept of an ϵ-semimetric that satisfies the same axioms as a topological metric, except for an arbitrarily small allowance to violate the triangle inequality. Under this modification, we demonstrate the possibility of taking arbitrary points in space, assigning arbitrary desired distances between them (independent of their geometric location relative to each other, that is, independent of their 'features'), and constructing an ϵ-semimetric that measures exactly the desired distances in the point cloud. This results in a threat to fairness and objectiveness in applications of clustering algorithms: suppose that an adversary subjectively classifies people according to its whim or discriminatory preferences. Upon accusations of unethical behavior, the malicious data processor can plausibly deny these as follows: it designs a distance function (an ϵ-semimetric) that is (up to a fully controllable numeric 'round-off-error' ϵ) equivalent to a standard distance like the Euclidean. However, this crafted distance will exactly reproduce the (malicious) results and thus confirm them while pretending objectivity and transparency, since only standard and explainable artificial intelligence was used. This demonstration works without any data poisoning. We illustrate the method on randomly chosen points with stochastically independent random classifications assigned to them. Then, we apply standard implementations of k-Means and DBSCAN on the data points, which both exactly reproduce the desired (randomly chosen) classes. We also discuss non-adversarial applications of ϵ-semimetrics, and corroborate the construction with examples and implementation in Octave. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The progression of artificial intelligence, particularly in healthcare domain, has brought significant progress to treatment, drug discovery, disease diagnosis and more. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a scenario-based preferences risk register framework for quantifying AI related risks in disease diagnosis. Two case studies, one involving physician and the other one with involving patients as the main stakeholders, are compared to evaluate the effectiveness of the framework and to evaluate how the initiatives ranking orders will evolve based on the most and least disruptive scenarios for each cases. The framework is applied to realistic case studies on cardiac sarcoidosis, identifying success criteria, initiatives, emergent conditions, and the most and least disruptive scenarios. The success criteria align with the National Institute of Standards and Technology AI Risk Management Framework (NIST AI RMF) seven trustworthy AI characteristics. Finally, the framework identifies the most and least disruptive scenarios and the most important initiatives for both cases. Results show that Non-Interpretable AI and Lack of Human-AI Communications, Privacy Attacks, and Human Errors in Design, Develop, Measurement and Implementation are the most disruptive scenarios in both cases, however, scenario Cyber Security Threats also counted as other most disruptive scenarios to the initiatives ranked by patients. This adaptable framework has the potential not only to transfer findings to global healthcare systems but also to extend its effectiveness to various other domains, such as transportation, finance, environment, and design. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents an interpretable machine-learning model for anomaly detection in door locks using torque data. The model aims to replace the human tactile sense in the quality control process, reducing repetitive tasks and improving reliability. The model achieved an accuracy of 96%, however, to gain social acceptance and operators' trust, interpretability of the model is crucial. The purpose of this study was to evaluate an approach that can improve interpretability of anomalous classifications obtained from an anomaly detection model. We evaluate four instance-based counterfactual explanators, three of which, employ optimization techniques and one uses, a less complex, weighted nearest neighbor approach, which serve as our baseline. The former approaches, leverage a latent representation of the data, using a weighted principal component analysis, improving plausibility of the counter factual explanations and reduces computational cost. The explanations are presented together with the 5-50-95th percentile range of the training data, acting as a frame of reference to improve interpretability. All approaches successfully presented valid and plausible counterfactual explanations. However, instance-based approaches employing optimization techniques yielded explanations with greater similarity to the observations and was therefore concluded to be preferable despite the higher execution times (4-16s) compared to the baseline approach (0.1s). The findings of this study hold significant value for the lock industry and can potentially be extended to other industrial settings using timeseries data, serving as a valuable point of departure for further research. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study investigates the impact of various air pollutants in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Vietnam, employing a supervised clustering approach that integrates Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values with a publicly available outdoor air quality dataset. The research focuses on identifying influential pollutant factors, affected city regions, their impact on surrounding areas, and the effectiveness of supervised clustering using SHAP values in pinpointing intersections between impacted stations. A feature set from Rakholia et al. (2023) is utilized in conjunction with tree-based machine learning models for each target time series. This approach provides insights into the contribution of different variables through the lens of eXplainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-SHAP methodology. The study also explores intersections between affected areas using the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection technique. Key findings indicate a pronounced influence of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and Temperature on morning air quality, largely attributed to traffic congestion. Conversely, Carbon Monoxide (CO) and Ozone (O3) significantly affect the afternoon air quality, influenced by solar radiation and industrial activities. Spatial and temporal analysis of air pollution variables suggests that mapping interference between monitoring stations can enhance categorization accuracy in certain city’s parts. This research provides valuable insights that can significantly benefit urban planning, time-sensitive policy development, and targeted intervention strategies. These findings are intended to support policymakers and stakeholders in addressing air pollution in HCMC more effectively. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Belief rule base (BRB) has attracted considerable interest due to its interpretability and exceptional modeling accuracy. Generally, BRB construction relies on prior knowledge or historical data. The limitations of knowledge constrain the knowledge-based BRB and are unsuitable for use in large-scale rule bases. Data-driven techniques excel at extracting model parameters from data, thus significantly improving the accuracy of BRB. However, the previous data-based BRBs neglected the study of interpretability, and some still depend on prior knowledge or introduce additional parameters. All these factors make the BRB highly problem-specific and limit its broad applicability. To address these problems, a model-agnostic statistical BRB (MAS-BRB) modeling approach is proposed in this article. It adopts an MAS methodology for parameter extraction, ensuring that the parameters both fulfill their intended roles within the BRB framework and accurately represent complex, nonlinear data relationships. A comprehensive interpretability analysis of MAS-BRB components further confirms their compliance with established BRB interpretability standards. Experiments conducted on multiple public datasets demonstrate that MAS-BRB not only achieves improved modeling performance but also shows greater effectiveness compared to existing rule-based and traditional machine learning models. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This abstract explores the integration of holographic surfaces into industrial human-machine interfaces (HMIs) to optimize anomaly detection processes. By utilizing this cutting-edge technology, industrial environments can achieve more efficient and effective anomaly detection, ultimately leading to increased safety, productivity, and operational integrity. Holographic user interfaces provide a novel approach by visualizing complex data in an immersive, intuitive, and interactive way. By projecting three-dimensional representations of equipment, processes, and real-time data onto user interfaces, operators can quickly recognize anomalies and deviations from normal operating conditions. The holographic interfaces provide contextual awareness, improving operators’ understanding of the industrial environment and enabling them to make informed decisions with confidence. Holographic interfaces have the potential to revolutionize anomaly detection in industrial HMIs, resulting in improved efficiency and safety in industrial operations. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Machine learning has been used by insurance companies for nearly a decade to identify potential risks and improve underwriting decisions. Nonetheless, there is a lack of systematic survey articles on state-of-the-art (SoTA) machine learning techniques, especially with respect to Society-oriented Environment models, developed to tackle these problems. This article begins by outlining the limitations of current systems used in this domain, including interpretability and explainability constraints, privacy issues, and the credibility of machine learning constructions along with their solutions. It then provides an extensive review of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms such as Explainable AI, Privacy-Preserving Techniques, Federated and Transfer Learning, Sharpley, as well as others developed and applied for various Life Insurtech problems. The article also examines the existing challenges and future trends in developing machine-learning-based underwriting decision approaches. We believe that this survey can offer practical guidance for building next-generation insurance risk management systems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Advancements in battery management systems (BMS) involve using digital twins to optimize battery performance in electric vehicles. The state of charge and health estimations are essential for battery efficiency and longevity. Digital twins allow for precise predictions of the state of charge and state of health by simulating battery behavior under different conditions. Using artificial intelligence (AI) in digital twins improves predictive capabilities, as demonstrated through studies employing deep neural networks (DNN) and long short-term memory networks (LSTM). However, incorporating AI presents challenges due to the opaque nature of the models, necessitating the need for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and trustworthy digital twin models. This study pioneered XAI methods such as SHapley Additive exPlanations, Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations, and linear regression-based surrogate models to explain the predictions of DNNs and LSTMs in digital twin-supported BMSs. The results reveal that the DNN and LSTM digital twin models are more reliable for state-of-health and state-of-charge estimation due to higher R^{2} scores, lower mean residuals, and better XAI results. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The large success of deep learning based methods in Visual Question Answering (VQA) has concurrently increased the demand for explainable methods. Most methods in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) focus on generating post-hoc explanations rather than taking an intrinsic approach, the latter characterizing an interpretable model. In this work, we introduce an interpretable approach for graph-based VQA and demonstrate competitive performance on the GQA dataset. This approach bridges the gap between interpretability and performance. Our model is designed to intrinsically produce a subgraph during the question-answering process as its explanation, providing insight into the decision making. To evaluate the quality of these generated subgraphs, we compare them against established post-hoc explainability methods for graph neural networks, and perform a human evaluation. Moreover, we present quantitative metrics that correlate with the evaluations of human assessors, acting as automatic metrics for the generated explanatory subgraphs. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/DigitalPhonetics/Intrinsic-Subgraph-Generation-for-VQA. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This article explores the ethical dilemmas propelled by a significant shift in the allocation of trust and intelligence due to blockchain technology and AI, resulting in a notable decrease in transaction costs. The ethical and political implications of democratizing the resulting productivity gains are noteworthy, and while the pie is expanding, how its slices are distributed remains an open question. Enter Worldcoin, an innovative worldwide initiative that creates an identity system based on proof of personhood and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) to provide everyone with a distinct and anonymous "World ID. Using the author's “cyberethics-mix" framework, this paper examines the possible implications of such a system concerning data's protection, ownership, accuracy, and accessibility, underscoring the ethical significance of a political approach emphasizing inclusivity and sustainability through digital decentralization. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Recent research has revealed that using machine learning systems for the analysis of genetic data could reliably detect Alzheimer's disease. The interpretability of these models, however, has been a challenge, as they frequently provided little insight into the features that contribute to their predictions. Explainable machine learning has been presented as a solution to this problem since it enables the identification of significant attributes and gives a clearer method of making predictions. In this study, Genome-Wide Association Studies were used to recognize genetic variants associated with Alzheimer's disease, utilizing the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset and quality control methods to ensure the validity and reliability of the findings. The results indicate strong connections between certain genetic variations and Alzheimer's disease, highlighting the potential of Genome-Wide Association Studies as a valuable tool for identifying and predicting this disease. After studying and analyzing the genetic data, machine learning algorithms are utilized to train a model to detect Alzheimer. The Support Vector Machine achieved 89% accuracy as the best-performing model. Explainable machine learning has the potential to increase the accuracy and interpretability of Alzheimer's disease detection models, giving significant insights for both academics and physicians. The explanation of the support vector machine model reveals that rs4821510 is the most important SNP in detecting AD. On top of that, the SHAP method shows that rs429358 is an indication for Alzheimer's disease and rs4821510 presents in the healthy ones. These findings suggest that explainable machine learning can play an important role in accurately detecting Alzheimer's disease and identifying critical genetic markers associated with the disease. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Asking annotators to explain “why” they labeled an instance yields annotator rationales: natural language explanations that provide reasons for classifications. In this work, we survey the collection and use of annotator rationales. Human-annotated rationales can improve data quality and form a valuable resource for improving machine learning models. Moreover, human-annotated rationales can inspire the construction and evaluation of model-annotated rationales, which can play an important role in explainable artificial intelligence. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), instance-based explanations have gained importance as a method for illuminating complex models by highlighting differences or similarities between the samples and their explanations. The evaluation of these explanations is crucial for assessing their quality and effectiveness. However, the quantitative evaluation of instance-based explanation methods reveals inconsistencies and variations in terminology and metrics. Addressing this, our survey provides a unified notation for instance-based explanation evaluation metrics for instance-based explanations with a particular focus on counterfactual explanations. Further, it explores associated trade-offs, identifies areas for improvement, and offers a practical Python toolkit, CEval. Key contributions include a survey of quantitative evaluation metrics, facilitating practical counterfactual evaluation with the package, and providing insights into explanation evaluation limitations and future directions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Machine learning algorithms have achieved great success due to their excellent predictive performance, but their applicability is limited in areas where there is a high demand for model interpretability. Aiming at the weakness of lacking interpretability of machine learning algorithms, a new interpretable machine learning algorithm called ensemble trees penalized logistic rule regression is proposed based on the idea of rules ensemble, which can achieve comparable predictive performance to the ensemble trees algorithm with less structural complexity and retains the interpretive effect of logistic regression. Firstly, it extracts branches from ensemble trees such as random forest and XGBoost, and converts them into logic rules. Then, the rule set is pruned and deduplicated to obtain a streamlined rule set. Finally, the rules are incorporated into logistic regression as variables and complexity control is performed with Lasso algorithm. Taking the enterprise risk warning as an example, it is compared with multiple machine learning algorithms. The results show that this algorithm not only inherits the default discrimination ability of the ensemble trees well and exceeds most of the machine learning algorithms in various classification indices, but also can give the thresholds of the enterprise risk indices through the rules, which is convenient for enterprises to carry out risk management. Further, the enterprise credit score is produced according to this algorithm, which verifies its wide applicability. The obtained score conforms to the objective law and is discriminative, and the robustness of the model's prediction performance is verified by three public datasets. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The development and adoption of Vision Transformers and other deep-learning architectures for image classification tasks has been rapid. However, the 'black box' nature of neural networks is a barrier to adoption in applications where explainability is essential. While some techniques for generating explanations have been proposed, primarily for Convolutional Neural Networks, adapting such techniques to the new paradigm of Vision Transformers is non-trivial. This paper presents T-TAME, Transformer-compatible Trainable Attention Mechanism for Explanations (https://github.com/IDT-ITI/T-TAME), a general methodology for explaining deep neural networks used in image classification tasks. The proposed architecture and training technique can be easily applied to any convolutional or Vision Transformer-like neural network, using a streamlined training approach. After training, explanation maps can be computed in a single forward pass; these explanation maps are comparable to or outperform the outputs of computationally expensive perturbation-based explainability techniques, achieving SOTA performance. We apply T-TAME to three popular deep learning classifier architectures, VGG-16, ResNet-50, and ViT-B-16, trained on the ImageNet dataset, and we demonstrate improvements over existing state-of-the-art explainability methods. A detailed analysis of the results and an ablation study provide insights into how the T-TAME design choices affect the quality of the generated explanation maps. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Skin lesion segmentation plays a crucial role in the computer-aided diagnosis of melanoma. Deep Learning models have shown promise in accurately segmenting skin lesions, but their widespread adoption in real-life clinical settings is hindered by their inherent black-box nature. In domains as critical as healthcare, interpretability is not merely a feature but a fundamental requirement for model adoption. This paper proposes IARS SegNet an advanced segmentation framework built upon the SegNet baseline model. Our approach incorporates three critical components: Skip connections, residual convolutions, and a global attention mechanism onto the baseline Segnet architecture. These elements play a pivotal role in accentuating the significance of clinically relevant regions, particularly the contours of skin lesions. The inclusion of skip connections enhances the model's capacity to learn intricate contour details, while the use of residual convolutions allows for the construction of a deeper model while preserving essential image features. The global attention mechanism further contributes by extracting refined feature maps from each convolutional and deconvolutional block, thereby elevating the model's interpretability. This enhancement highlights critical regions, fosters better understanding, and leads to more accurate skin lesion segmentation for melanoma diagnosis. This study primarily focuses on the interpretation of performance improvements in the base model resulting from the integration of each of these three components. To comprehensively assess the performance gain achieved with each addition, we employ two sets of evaluation metrics, quantifying performance based on both regions and contours. The results underscore the superior segmentation capabilities of the proposed architecture compared to the SegNet and U-Net models. Notably, the model's performance gain due to each enhancement is visually interpretable. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Compared to traditional analysis of passenger flow characteristics, the consideration of the average travel distance of metro stations leads to a more refined understanding of the passenger flow dynamics of networks. This study focused on the metro system of Xi ’ an City to explore the complex relationship between multiple built environment factors and the station-level average travel distance. Eleven built environment indicator systems, including land use, point of interest features, surrounding transportation infrastructure, and station attributes, were first developed. An interpretable machine learning model based on Extreme Gradient Boosting with SHAP attribution analysis framework (XGBOOST-SHAP) was established to reveal the nonlinear relationship between these factors. Additionally, the advantages of the XGBOOST model in regression fitting were verified by the comparison with Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT) and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). The results show that the XGBOOST model achieves an R-squared value of 0.75, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.95 and mean squared error (MSE) of 1.36, outperforming the GBDT and OLS models in terms of fitting performance. A clear circular distribution pattern can be found with the spatial heterogeneity of average travel distance. SHAP attribution analysis reveals that apart from the distance to the city center feature, other features such as road network density, land use mix, the number of bus routes, and residential count also contribute significantly to the travel distance. The influence of POI Shannon entropy index and food service points on average travel distance does not show clear positive or negative feedback. Other indicators demonstrate a combined positive and negative feedback mechanism on average travel distance. The research results, which are beneficial for transportation demand analysis, route capacity optimization, and operational effectiveness evaluation, can effectively improve the convenience of metro transportation, satisfy the needs of different regions, and enhance the efficiency and sustainability of the entire metro system. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A predictive digital twin (DT)-driven dynamic error control approach is presented for accuracy control in high-frequency slow-tool-servo ultraprecision diamond turning processes. An explainable artificial intelligence-enabled real-time DT of the total dynamic error (inside and outside the servo loop) was established using in-line acceleration input data near the tool. A feedforward controller was used to mitigate the total dynamic errors before they came into effect. The machining trials using this approach showed that significant improvement in machining accuracy (87%, surface form accuracy; 95%, phase accuracy with precisions of 0.06 µm and 0.05°), and efficiency (8 times the state-of-the-art) were successfully achieved. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, a novel semantic concept-based inference neural network (SCINN) is proposed to develop a design methodology for the explainable deep neuro-fuzzy models and improve their generalization performance in high-dimensional problems. Traditional neuro-fuzzy models exhibit outstanding interpretability in the problems of lower dimensionality. However, when faced with high-dimensional scenarios, the long rule and rule explosion problems damage their interpretability and result in poor generalization performance, even making them unusable. Although deep neuro-fuzzy models show enhanced performance in handling high-dimensional problems compared to traditional counterparts, they often come at the expense of interpretability. To establish a neuro-fuzzy model that can address high-dimensional problems while preserving the interpretability, the SCINN is proposed with the aid of the concept-based measure generation paradigm (CMGP) and the multi-view information augmentation strategy (MIAS). The CMGP is designed to adaptively define the membership functions (MFs) that correspond to the human-understandable concepts based on the given data; the defined MFs contribute to the construction of the explainable fuzzy rule that can directly process high-dimensional data. The MIAS is structured to develop a unified paradigm for implementing consequence functions in the fuzzy rules, which enhances the approximation ability of the SCINN. The performance of SCINN is evaluated on various image datasets against different competitors, including neuro-fuzzy-based approaches and deep structure-based neural networks. A real-world application is adopted to evaluate its effectiveness. The experimental results show that SCINN outperforms the compared neuro-fuzzy models and is comparable to the deep structure-based neural networks. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The Industrial Revolution has shifted toward Industry 5.0, reinventing the Industry 4.0 operational process by introducing human elements into critical decision processes. Industry 5.0 would present massive customization via transformative technologies, such as cyber-physical systems (CPSs), artificial intelligence (AI), and big data analytics. In Industry 5.0, the AI models must be transparent, valid, and interpretable. AI models employ machine learning and deep learning mechanisms to make the industrial process autonomous, reduce downtime, and improve operational and maintenance costs. However, the models require explainability in the learning process. Thus, explainable AI (EXAI) adds interpretability and improves the diagnosis of critical industrial processes, which augments the machine-to-human explanations and vice versa. Recent surveys of EXAI in industrial applications are mostly oriented toward EXAI models, the underlying assumptions. Still, fewer studies are conducted toward a holistic integration of EXAI with human-centric processes that drives the Industry 5.0 applicative verticals. Thus, to address the gap, we propose a first-of-its-kind survey that systematically untangles EXAI integration and its potential in Industry 5.0 applications. First, we present the background of EXAI in Industry 5.0 and CPSs and a reference EXAI-based Industry 5.0 architecture with insights into large language models. Then, based on the research questions, a solution taxonomy of EXAI in Industry 5.0 is presented, which is ably supported by applicative use cases (cloud, digital twins, smart grids, augmented reality, and unmanned aerial vehicles). Finally, a case study of EXAI in manufacturing cost assessment is discussed, followed by open issues and future directions. The survey is designed to extend novel prototypes and designs to realize EXAI-based real-time Industry 5.0 applications. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The openness characteristic of social networks facilitates the rapid spread of rumors, necessitating effective methods for detecting and managing the abundance of rumors on social media. Existing studies have primarily focused on improving the accuracy of rumor detection, but often overlook the vital aspects of interpretability and explanation of rumor patterns, limiting their credibility and real-world usability. Additionally, previous works have typically examined only a subset of user features, content, and spreading structure, neglecting the analysis of compound rules. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework for detecting rumor patterns that emphasize comprehensive feature construction and the explanation of compound rules. Our framework incorporates multi-dimensional features, including user characteristics, post content, and the structure of information propagation. Advanced techniques, including large language models (such as ChatGPT) and graph motif discovery algorithms, are employed for feature construction. By leveraging diverse features, crucial integrated rules identified by Rulefit can investigate the contextually dependent associations among various interrelated rumor factors. We consolidate and analyze seven distinct rumor patterns based on the Credible Early Detection Dataset, deriving valuable insights into the inherent characteristics of rumors. The recognition of rumor patterns empowers social media platforms and fact-checking organizations to develop targeted and explainable interventions that effectively mitigate the spread of rumors and safeguard the integrity of information. These interventions greatly enhance the transparency and trustworthiness of rumor management, fostering a more reliable information ecosystem. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques generate explanations for predictions from AI models. These explanations can be evaluated for (i) faithfulness to the prediction, i.e., its correctness about the reasons for prediction, and (ii) usefulness to the user. While there are metrics to evaluate faithfulness, to our knowledge, there are no automated metrics to evaluate the usefulness of explanations in the clinical context. Our objective is to develop a new metric to evaluate usefulness of AI explanations to clinicians. Usefulness evaluation needs to consider both (a) how humans generally process explanations and (b) clinicians' specific requirements from explanations presented by clinical decision support systems (CDSS). Our new scoring method can evaluate the usefulness of explanations generated by any XAI method that provides importance values for the input features of the prediction model. Our method draws on theories from social science to gauge usefulness, and uses literature-derived biomedical knowledge graphs to quantify support for the explanations from clinical literature. We evaluate our method in a case study on predicting onset of sepsis in intensive care units. Our analysis shows that the scores obtained using our method corroborate with independent evidence from clinical literature and have the required qualities expected from such a metric. Thus, our method can be used to evaluate and select useful explanations from a diverse set of XAI techniques in clinical contexts, making it a fundamental tool for future research in the design of AI-driven CDSS. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The world has lived an exceptional time period caused by the Coronavirus pandemic. To limit Covid-19 propagation, governments required people to wear a facial mask outside. In facial data analysis, maskwearing on the human face creates predominant occlusion hiding the important oral region and causing more challenges for human face recognition and categorisation. The appropriation of existing solutions by taking into consideration the masked context is indispensable for researchers. In this paper, we propose an approach for mask-wearing prediction and adaptive facial human-gender classification. The proposed approach is based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Both mask-wearing and gender information are crucial for various possible applications. Experimentation shows that maskwearing is very well detectable by using CNNs and justifies its use as a prepossessing step. It also shows that retraining with masked faces is indispensable to keep up gender classification performances. In addition, experimentation proclaims that in a controlled facepose with acceptable image quality’ context, the gender attribute remains well detectable. Finally, we show empirically that the adaptive proposed approach improves global performance for gender prediction in a mixed context. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in combining artificial intelligence (AI) with education to enhance learning experiences. However, one major concern is the lack of transparency in AI models, which hinders our ability to understand their decision-making processes and establish trust in their outcomes. This study aims to address these challenges by focusing on the implications of explainable and trustworthy AI in education. The primary objective of this research is to improve trust and acceptance of AI systems in education by providing comprehensive explanations for model predictions. By doing so, it seeks to equip stakeholders with a better understanding of the decision-making process and increase their confidence in the outcomes. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of evaluation metrics in assessing the quality and effectiveness of explanations generated by explanation AI models. These metrics serve as vital tools for ensuring reliable system performance and upholding the fundamental principles necessary for building trustworthy AI. To accomplish these goals, the study utilizes the LBLS-467 dataset to predict high-risk students, employing both logistic regression and neural networks as AI models. Subsequently, explanation artificial intelligence techniques such as LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) are utilized to evaluate students' learning outcomes and provide explanations. Finally, six evaluation indicators are adopted to assess the accuracy and stability of these explanations. In conclusion, this study addresses the challenges associated with inconsistencies in explainable AI models within the field of education. It emphasizes the need for explainability and trust when applying AI systems in educational contexts. By providing comprehensive explanations and evaluation metrics, this research empowers education teams to make informed decisions and fosters a positive environment for the integration of AI. Ultimately, it contributes to the reliable implementation of AI technologies, enabling their full potential to be harnessed in educational settings for the benefit of learners and educators alike. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The escalating integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in various domains, especially Project Management (PM), has brought to light the imperative need for inclusivity in AI systems. This paper investigates the role of AI software in augmenting both the inclusiveness and efficiency within the realm of PM. The research pivots around specific criteria that define and measure the inclusiveness of AI in PM, highlighting how AI, when developed with inclusiveness in mind, can significantly enhance project outcomes. However, there are inherent challenges in achieving this inclusiveness, primarily due to biases embedded in AI learning databases and the design and development processes of AI systems. The study offers a comprehensive examination of AI's potential to revolutionize PM by enabling managers to concentrate more on people-centric aspects of their work. This is achieved through AI's ability to perform tasks such as data collection, reporting, and predictive analysis more consistently and efficiently than human counterparts. However, the incorporation of AI in PM extends beyond mere efficiency; it represents a paradigm shift in the epistemology of PM, calling for a deeper understanding of AI's role and impact on society. Despite these advantages, the adoption of AI comes with significant challenges, particularly in terms of bias and inclusiveness. Biased AI learning databases, which use shared and reusable datasets, often perpetuate initially discriminatory algorithms. Moreover, unconscious biases and stereotypes of AI designers, developers, and trainers can inadvertently influence the behavior of the AI systems they create. This necessitates a paradigmatic shift in how AI systems are developed and governed to ensure they do not replicate or exacerbate existing social inequalities. The research proposes a methodological approach involving the development of criteria for inclusion and exclusion, alongside data extraction, to evaluate the inclusiveness and efficiency of AI software in enhancing PM. This approach is crucial for understanding and addressing the challenges and limitations of AI in the context of PM. By focusing on inclusiveness, the study underscores the importance of a synergy between technological advancement and ethical consideration, demanding a comprehensive understanding and regulation to mitigate risks and maximize benefits. In conclusion, this paper presents a detailed exploration of AI's role in PM highlighting both its potential benefits and the ethical challenges it poses. The findings and recommendations of this study contribute to the growing discourse on the need for inclusive AI systems in PM, offering insights for AI developers and Project Managers (PMs) alike. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Credit score analysis is vital to modern banking systems, allowing banks and other financial institutions to determine a borrower's creditworthiness. In such a situation, accurate and robust prediction models are vital because they allow lenders to make rational decisions regarding loan approvals and risk management. This paper provides an overview of using XGBoost, a sophisticated machine learning algorithm, to improve credit score evaluation, and the XAI model, LIME, to describe the black box machine learning algorithm. XGBoost, a gradient boosting-based ensemble learning algorithm, has gained prominence for its capacity to give improved predicted accuracy while handling vast and complicated datasets. Its algorithmic characteristics, including regularization, parallel processing, and decision tree optimisation, make it especially well-suited for credit scoring problems. Because of its complexity, implementing XAI is critical since it will help lenders grasp the reasons for the result of the XGBoost. The results show how the XAI model, LIME, helps simplify the complexity of these models. It is critical to integrate XAI models since they will improve lender decision-making. The fundamental goal of this research is to evaluate the XAI model, LIME, and determine how well the XAI model explains the findings of our experimental tests. Furthermore, it illustrates the possibility of incorporating LIME into credit score analysis, resulting in more efficient lending procedures, enhanced risk management, and better decision-making. Finally, this paper emphasizes the importance of using advanced machine learning techniques such as XGBoost in credit scoring analysis, which has the potential to transform the way banks and other financial institutions assess credit risk, as well as include LIME for a better understanding of the results. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Regardless of the tremendous technological development in manufacturing processes and equipment, assembly errors are an emerging concern. Hence, quality inspection software is of high importance for capturing defects at the source and preventing further error propagation. The advantages of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) as knowledge representation models with explainable capabilities can be compounded with the advantages of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in order to acquire accurate and interpretable inspection results in Smart Manufacturing. In this work, an explainable binary classification approach is performed, namely DeepK-FCM, and appears to be able to assess sufficiently industrial images from TELEVES. The suggested DeepK-FCM methodology, inheriting the powerful characteristics of deep learning and FCMs, includes a number of steps as follows: fine-tuning of well-known CNNs for feature extraction with transfer learning, feature clustering by performing K-Means algorithm, definition of causal relationships through fuzzy measures on similarities produced and FCM model for the decision-making. Through the experimental analysis on a real industrial data set, it is being proved that the current approach with DeepK-FCM is more efficient for the task of defect inspection in the antenna assembly than the straightforward binary classification accomplished by CNNs. The attained accuracy of 80% is improved by 3% compared to the state-of-art CNN classifiers and indicates a high potential even when the data are scarce. In addition, the decision-making with FCMs levitates the interpretability of the system which contributes to the efforts towards a more explainable AI method for quality control inspection. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Digital Twins (DT) are essentially dynamic data-driven models that serve as real-time symbiotic “virtual replicas” of real-world systems. DT can leverage fundamentals of Dynamic Data-Driven Applications Systems (DDDAS) bidirectional symbiotic sensing feedback loops for its continuous updates. Sensing loops can consequently steer measurement, analysis and reconfiguration aimed at more accurate modelling and analysis in DT. The reconfiguration decisions can be autonomous or interactive, keeping human-in-the-loop. The trustworthiness of these decisions can be hindered by inadequate explainability of the rationale, and utility gained in implementing the decision for the given situation among alternatives. Additionally, different decision-making algorithms and models have varying complexity, quality and can result in different utility gained for the model. The inadequacy of explainability can limit the extent to which humans can evaluate the decisions, often leading to updates which are unfit for the given situation, erroneous, compromising the overall accuracy of the model. The novel contribution of this paper is an approach to harnessing explainability in human-in-the-loop DDDAS and DT systems, leveraging bidirectional symbiotic sensing feedback. The approach utilises interpretable machine learning and goal modelling to explainability, and considers trade-off analysis of utility gained. We use examples from smart warehousing to demonstrate the approach. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cast-resin transformers are affected by deterioration due to manufacturing defects and continuous load. Studying PD, which is capable of detecting defects or degradation in advance, is important. With the rapid advancement of AI technologies, research on PD classification using CNN models is being actively conducted. However, due to the black box problem, it is impossible to explain the reasoning behind the learning outcomes. Therefore, relying solely on predictive outcomes of learning for PD classification raises issues of reliability. Recent studies in various fields are progressing with the application of XAI to address the black box issue of CNNs, aiming to identify the criteria used for making predictions. However, research on applying XAI in AI-based PD classification is currently insufficient. Therefore, further study on the implementation of XAI is necessary. In this paper, an excellent CNN model was applied to image classification for PD classification of cast-resin transformers, and the grad-cam model was used for XAI. This approach proposes a method for humans to comprehend the rationale behind the learning outcomes. The training data includes artificial defects created in laboratory settings and noise captured in cast-resin transformers using UHF sensors. Our research demonstrated that PD and noise due to defects can be identified with an accuracy of approximately 97%. The reasons for successful and failed results were analyzed through XAI. Consequently, it was observed that the application of XAI to CNN models leads to the construction of a more reliable model. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Banking is a dynamic industry that places significant importance on risk management, requiring accurate and interpretable AI models to make transparent lending decisions. This study introduces a groundbreaking approach that combines a multistage ensemble technique with a 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. The algorithm not only delivers superior classification performance but also offers interpretable explanations for its decisions. The algorithm is designed with multiple strategic steps to enhance model performance without sacrificing explainability. Thorough experiments were conducted using datasets from private banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) in India to evaluate the algorithm's performance. It was compared against various state-of-the-art models, demonstrating remarkable precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy values of 0.994, 0.992, 0.993, and 0.991, respectively. This outperformed competing models like homogeneous deep ensembles, 1D CNN, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Furthermore, individual borrower dataset evaluations confirmed the proposed algorithm's consistency and efficiency, achieving precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy values of 0.960, 0.961, 0.952, and 0.964, respectively. The research emphasizes the effectiveness of the explanatory integration decision process, wherein the Explainable Multistage Ensemble 1D CNN not only provides enhanced credit risk prediction but also facilitates transparent and interpretable lending decisions. The algorithm's ability to offer understandable explanations empowers financial institutions to make well-informed lending decisions, reduce credit risk, and foster a more stable and inclusive financial ecosystem. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Deep learning models are black boxes. Thus, determining the source domain data contributing to transfer learning for ground settlement prediction is impossible. The research presented in this article aims to determine the source domain data (i.e., the dataset or domain used for model pretraining) that contributes most to transfer learning for risk prediction in tunnel construction and quantify its contribution to improving prediction accuracy. We propose a novel explainable transfer learning approach to quantify the selection of degraded knowledge from source and subsource domains. Our approach comprises feature selection and space point clustering, construction of a similarity metric between the target domain and each subsource domain, and construction of a stacked deep neural network model with selective transfer learning. We apply our model to a real-life tunnel project to demonstrate its feasibility and effectiveness. The results indicate that our proposed explainable transfer learning approach outperforms other transparent and opaque analysis models on risk prediction with R2 above 0.5 by adjusting the clustering, transferring, and freezing strategy, and the optimal number of freezing layers should be less than half of the total number of layers, and the best number of freezing layers is 1. We show that explaining transfer learning enables transparency in training and understanding the source domain data, contributing to ground settlement prediction. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) can reflect spontaneous neural activities in the brain and is widely used for brain disorder analysis. Previous studies focus on extracting fMRI representations using machine/deep learning methods, but these features typically lack biological interpretability. The human brain exhibits a remarkable modular structure in spontaneous brain functional networks, with each module comprised of functionally interconnected brain regions-of-interest (ROIs). However, existing learning-based methods cannot adequately utilize such brain modularity prior. In this paper, we propose a brain modularity-constrained dynamic representation learning framework for interpretable fMRI analysis, consisting of dynamic graph construction, dynamic graph learning via a novel modularity-constrained graph neural network (MGNN), and prediction and biomarker detection. The designed MGNN is constrained by three core neurocognitive modules (i.e., salience network, central executive network, and default mode network), encouraging ROIs within the same module to share similar representations. To further enhance discriminative ability of learned features, we encourage the MGNN to preserve network topology of input graphs via a graph topology reconstruction constraint. Experimental results on 534 subjects with rs-fMRI scans from two datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The identified discriminative brain ROIs and functional connectivities can be regarded as potential fMRI biomarkers to aid in clinical diagnosis. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Visual inspection tasks often require humans to cooperate with artificial intelligence (AI)-based image classifiers. To enhance this cooperation, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) can highlight those image areas that have contributed to an AI decision. However, the literature on visual cueing suggests that such XAI support might come with costs of its own. To better understand how the benefits and cost of XAI depend on the accuracy of AI classifications and XAI highlights, we conducted two experiments that simulated visual quality control in a chocolate factory. Participants had to decide whether chocolate molds contained faulty bars or not, and were always informed whether the AI had classified the mold as faulty or not. In half of the experiment, they saw additional XAI highlights that justified this classification. While XAI speeded up performance, its effects on error rates were highly dependent on (X)AI accuracy. XAI benefits were observed when the system correctly detected and highlighted the fault, but XAI costs were evident for misplaced highlights that marked an intact area while the actual fault was located elsewhere. Eye movement analyses indicated that participants spent less time searching the rest of the mold and thus looked at the fault less often. However, we also observed large interindividual differences. Taken together, the results suggest that despite its potentials, XAI can discourage people from investing effort into their own information analysis. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - As we transition from the 5G epoch, a new horizon beckons with the advent of 6G, seeking a profound fusion with novel communication paradigms and emerging technological trends, bringing once-futuristic visions to life along with added technical intricacies. Although analytical models lay the foundations and offer systematic insights, we have recently witnessed a noticeable surge in research suggesting machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) can efficiently deal with complex problems by complementing or replacing model-based approaches. The majority of data-driven wireless research leans heavily on discriminative AI (DAI) that requires vast real-world datasets. Unlike the DAI, Generative AI (GenAI) pertains to generative models (GMs) capable of discerning the underlying data distribution, patterns, and features of the input data. This makes GenAI a crucial asset in wireless domain wherein real-world data is often scarce, incomplete, costly to acquire, and hard to model or comprehend. With these appealing attributes, GenAI can replace or supplement DAI methods in various capacities. Accordingly, this combined tutorial-survey paper commences with preliminaries of 6G and wireless intelligence by outlining candidate 6G applications and services, presenting a taxonomy of state-of-the-art DAI models, exemplifying prominent DAI use cases, and elucidating the multifaceted ways through which GenAI enhances DAI. Subsequently, we present a tutorial on GMs by spotlighting seminal examples such as generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, flow-based GMs, diffusion-based GMs, generative transformers, large language models, autoregressive GMs, to name a few. Contrary to the prevailing belief that GenAI is a nascent trend, our exhaustive review of approximately 120 technical papers demonstrates the scope of research across core wireless research areas, including 1) physical layer design; 2) network optimization, organization, and management; 3) network traffic analytics; 4) cross-layer network security; and 5) localization & positioning. Furthermore, we outline the central role of GMs in pioneering areas of 6G network research, including semantic communications, integrated sensing and communications, THz communications, extremely large antenna arrays, near-field communications, digital twins, AI-generated content services, mobile edge computing and edge AI, adversarial ML, and trustworthy AI. Lastly, we shed light on the multifarious challenges ahead, suggesting potential strategies and promising remedies. Given its depth and breadth, we are confident that this tutorial-cum-survey will serve as a pivotal reference for researchers and professionals delving into this dynamic and promising domain. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - AI-based decision systems often lack transparency due to their black-box nature and lack explanations of their decisions, which are crucial for life-changing applications such as disease diagnosis, financial investments, and military decisions. Explainable AI (XAI) deals with explanations, justifications, and accountability of AI applications and has become the call of the present time. However, there is a dearth of XAI protocols which associate technicality and usability. In this paper, novel, usable XAI definitions are introduced, where Wasserstein distance serves as the backbone. The key essence of our work is to integrate the mathematical formulation with the performances of the model. Our work provides definitions in three contexts - i) the explainability of a model, ii) the explainability of the features, and iii) the explainability of the decisions rendered by a model. In this work, the proposed constructions are validated through experiments done on finitely many different models. The empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets validate a positive association between proposed explainabilities and the performance of a model. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to describe the tool for combining the information of control charts, widely used for statistical quality control with the information obtained from the process of explanation the classification decision made using the machine learning model. Control charts are used to monitor production and show deviations from normal behavior, especially when upper and lower control limits of measured parameters are defined. Analysis of SHAP explanations allowed us to show some dependencies of classification process. Our application, which allows the user to compare the information taken from both control charts and SHAP plots, helps the user discover anomalies, especially dependencies between exceeding the limits of controlled parameters and the relevance of these values in SHAP calculations. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Model trees combine the strengths of two interpretable models - namely, decision trees and multiple linear regression - to handle complex nonlinear problems, making them a popular machine learning strategy in civil engineering. Analyzing the error terms between predicted and target outputs is the standard method for evaluating the model's accuracy. However, the model does not explain the variance associated with the predicted output for a given set of inputs, which may be deemed insufficient in many civil engineering applications. This research proposes a framework that combines error propagation theory with the model tree algorithm to quantify the variance of the model predicted output and provide explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for engineering applications. A metric based on the variance estimate is proposed to decide whether the model predicted output is acceptable. A concrete strength prediction model is presented to demonstrate the application of the proposed methodology. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study addresses the critical global issue of food security, particularly under the influence of climate change on agricultural land suitability. The primary objective of our research is to predict the risks associated with land suitability degradation and changes in irrigation patterns, directly impacting food security. This research aligns with the United Nations' sustainable development goals to reduce hunger and malnutrition. Central Eurasia, a region facing unique economic and social challenges, serves as the focal point of our investigation, providing a pertinent example for analyzing the effects of climate change on food security. In our approach, we employ interpretable machine learning techniques to analyze the impact of climate change on agricultural land suitability under different carbon emission scenarios. The developed model demonstrates strong performance, evidenced by an accuracy of 86% and a mean average precision of 72% in a multi-class land suitability classification task. Focusing on the most vulnerable regions in Eastern Europe and Northern Asia, our research provides crucial insights for policymakers. These insights are instrumental for strategic planning, including the allocation of critical resources like water and fertilizers, to prevent humanitarian crises. The results demonstrate that machine learning can be a powerful tool in predicting and managing the impacts of climate change on food security. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for handling graph-structured data. However, their design often limits them to learning only higher-order feature interactions, leaving low-order feature interactions overlooked. To address this problem, we introduce a novel GNN method called explicit feature interaction-aware graph neural network (EFI-GNN). Unlike conventional GNNs, EFI-GNN is a multilayer linear network designed to model arbitrary-order feature interactions explicitly within graphs. To validate the efficacy of EFI-GNN, we conduct experiments using various datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that EFI-GNN has competitive performance with existing GNNs, and when a GNN is jointly trained with EFI-GNN, predictive performance sees an improvement. Furthermore, the predictions made by EFI-GNN are interpretable, owing to its linear construction. The source code of EFI-GNN is available at https://github.com/gim4855744/EFI-GNN. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

However, the black-box nature of AI models makes their inner workings difficult to understand and interpret. Deploying explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) can help explain why and how the output of AI models is generated. This article addresses the following research question: How can we accurately identify the critical factors influencing tunnel-induced ground settlement and provide counterfactual explanations to support risk-based decision-making? We apply an XAI approach using counterfactual explanations to help understand decision-making surrounding risks when considering control ground settlement. Our approach consists of a: 1) construction of Kernel principal components analysis-based deep neural network (DNN) model; 2) generation of counterfactual explanations; 3) analysis of risk prediction and assessment factors' importance, necessity, and sufficiency. We apply our approach to the San-yang road tunnel project in Wuhan, China. The results demonstrate that the KPCA-DNN model better predicted ground settlement based on high-dimensional input features than the baseline model (i.e., AdaBoost and RandomForest). The bubble chamber pressure→ cutter-head speed→ equipment inclination is also identified as the primary risk path. Our findings indicate that using counterfactual explanations enables transparency and trust in AI-based risk models to be acquired. Moreover, our approach can help site managers, engineers, and tunnel-boring machine operators understand how to manage better and mitigate the risk of ground settlement. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Feature Ensembles are a robust and effective method for finding the feature set that yields the best predictive accuracy for learning agents. However, current feature ensemble algorithms do not consider explainability as a key factor in their construction. To address this limitation, we present an algorithm that optimizes for the explainability and performance of a model – the Optimizing Feature Ensembles for Explainability (OFEE) algorithm. OFEE uses intersections of feature sets to produce a feature ensemble that optimally balances explainability and performance. Furthermore, OFEE is parameter-free and as such optimizes itself to a given dataset and explainability requirements. To evaluated OFEE, we considered two explainability measures, one based on ensemble size and the other based on ensemble stability. We found that OFEE was overall extremely effective within the nine canonical datasets we considered. It outperformed other feature selection algorithms by an average of over 8% and 7% respectively when considering the size and stability explainability measures. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The water quality of the Middle Route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (MRP) of China is related to the health and safety of about 8500w people. In recent years, multiple occurrences of abnormal algal proliferation in water conveyance channels have posed potential risks to the water quality of diverted water. To clarify the growth situation of phytoplankton and evaluate the response relationships between water environmental parameters and phytoplankton in the MRP, in this study, a long-term monitoring dataset was collected from seven monitoring sites from May 2015 to December 2020 to statistically analyse the spatiotemporal characteristics of planktonic algal cell density (ACD). Based on this, four machine learning models, including multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XBGoost), were constructed to predict the ACD, and the SHapely Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was used to interpret the best prediction model for identifying the response relationship between water environmental parameters and ACD. The results showed that (1) the seven monitoring sites could be divided into two significant groups (i.e., Group I and Group II) by hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), among which the ACD of Group II was higher than that of Group I. (2) the performance of four prediction models using different evaluation metrics indicated that the RF model surpassed in prediction accuracy compared with the other three models in predicting ACD variations in Group I and Group II. (3) SHAP analysis revealed that the key factors affecting ACD variations in Group I were water temperature (WT), water depth (WD), permanganate index (PI), flow rate (Q) and dissolved oxygen (DO), and the ACD were inhibited when WT was below 23 °C, WD exceeded 6.5 m, and Q was between 100 and 250 m3/s. Additionally, WT, PI, and DO were the most important predictors of ACD in Group II, and ACD were inhibited when WT was below 24 °C, PI was lower than 2.4 mg/L and DO was higher than 9 mg/L. This research provides a theoretical basis and reference for water quality management and algal ecological control of water transfer projects with high spatial heterogeneity. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Shield tunnel segment uplift is a common phenomenon in construction. Excessive and unstable uplift will affect tunnel quality and safety seriously, shorten the tunnel life, and is not conducive to the sustainable management of the tunnel’s entire life cycle. However, segment uplift is affected by many factors, and it is challenging to predict the uplift amount and determine its cause accurately. Existing research mainly focuses on analyzing uplift factors and the uplift trend features for specific projects, which is difficult to apply to actual projects directly. This paper sorts out the influencing factors of segment uplift and designs a spatial-temporal data fusion mechanism for prediction. On this basis, we extract the key influencing factors of segment uplift, construct a prediction model of segment uplift amount based on Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) v2.0.3, and use SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) v0.44.0 to locate factors affecting uplift, forming an Auxiliary Decision-making System for Segment Uplift Control (ADS-SUC). An ADS-SUC not only detects the sudden change of the segment uplift successfully and predicts the segment uplift in practical engineering accurately, it also provides a feasible method to control the uplift in time, which is of great significance for reducing the construction risk of the tunnel project and ensuring the quality of the completed tunnel. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The sustainable development of the construction industry necessitates the utilization of multipurpose Cement Composites (CC). Therefore, the integration of nanomaterials has the potential to provide CC that exhibits superior performance and possesses several functionalities. Hence, the use of Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) inside the concrete cementitious sector holds significant potential for implementing effective solutions toward creating a sustainable ecosystem characterized by versatile attributes. Nevertheless, the prediction of the characteristics of these composites is a significant challenge owing to their complex composite structure and non-linear response. Furthermore, the process of designing and executing experimental trials on diverse samples and across various age groups is arduous, time-consuming, and financially burdensome. There is currently a dearth of a predictive model capable of estimating the compressive strength of concrete including nanoparticles. The utilization of such models is of significant importance in the project and study of Reinforced Concrete (RC) structures including nanoparticles. Three machine learning algorithms, including Gene Expression Programming (GEP), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), were utilized in this study to forecast the Compressive Strength (CS) of nanocomposites that incorporate CNTs. The evaluation of the models' reliability was conducted by the utilization of cross-validation with K-folding and subsequent statistical error analysis. According to the results of the coefficient of determination (R2), the XGB model achieved the highest R2 value (0.95), while the GB model and GEP model both earned R2 values of 0.94. Furthermore, the validation method for the models included the implementation of statistical analysis and k-fold cross-validation. Therefore, the XGB model exhibited much lower values for statistical metrics compared to the GEP and GB models. In addition, a GEP empirical equation and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) have been created for practical applications in predicting the strength of concrete. This streamlines the procedure and provides a valuable instrument for harnessing the model's potential in the field of civil engineering. Furthermore, the use of Shapley analysis is conducted to assess the predominant factors in concrete prediction. The findings of this research indicate that the curing time, type of cement, and water-to-cement ratio significantly influence the properties of CNT-based concrete composites. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The rapid advancement of deep learning and computer vision has driven the intelligent evolution of fire detection, quantification and fighting, although most AI models remain opaque black boxes. This work applies explainable deep learning methods to quantify fire power by flame images and aims to elucidate the underlying mechanism of computer-vision fire calorimetry. The process begins with the utilization of a pre-trained fire segmentation model to create a flame image database in various formats: (1) original RGB, (2) background-free RGB, (3) background-free grey, and (4) background-free binary. This diverse database accounts for factors such as background, color, and brightness. Then, the synthetic database is employed to train and test the fire-calorimetry AI model. Results highlight the dominant role of determining flame area in fire calorimetry, while other factors displaying minimal influence. Enhancing the accuracy of flame segmentation significantly reduces error in computer-vision fire calorimetry to less than 20%. Finally, the study incorporates the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) method to visualize the pixel-level contribution to fire image identification. This research deepens the understanding of vision-based fire calorimetry and providing scientific support for future AI applications in fire monitoring, digital twin, and smart firefighting. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

However, to explain the knowledge gathered in a given layer, they must decide which of the numerous filters to study, further assuming that each of them corresponds to a single feature. This, coupled with the redundancy of information, makes it difficult to ensure that the relevant characteristics are being analyzed. The above represents an important challenge and defines the aim and scope of our proposal. In this paper we present a novel method, named Explainable Layer Factor Analysis for CNNs (ELFA-CNNs), which models and describes with quality convolutional layers relying on factor analysis. Regarding contributions, ELFA obtains the essential underlying features, together with their correlation with the original filters, providing an accurate and well-founded summary. Through the factorial parameters we gain insights about the information learned, the connections between channels, and the redundancy of the layer, among others. To provide visual explanations in a similarly way to other methods, two additional proposals are made: a) Essential Feature Attribution Maps (EFAM) and b) intrinsic features inversion. The results prove the effectiveness of the developed general methods. They are evaluated in different CNNs (VGG-16, ResNet-50, and DeepLabv3+) on generic datasets (CIFAR-10, imagenette, and CamVid). We demonstrate that convolutional layers adequately fit a factorial model thanks to the new metrics presented for factor and fitting residuals (D<inf>1</inf>, D<inf>></inf>, and Res, derive from covariance matrices). Moreover, knowledge about the deep image representations and the learning process is acquired, as well as reliable heat maps highlighting regions where essential features are located. This study effectively provides an explainable approach that can be applied to different CNNs and over different datasets. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a complementary technology in supply chain research. However, the majority of AI approaches explored in this context afford little to no explainability, which is a significant barrier to a broader adoption of AI in supply chains. In recent years, the need for explainability has been a strong impetus for research in hybrid AI methodologies that combine neural architectures with logic-based reasoning, which are collectively referred to as Neurosymbolic AI. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of supply chain management literature that employs approaches within the neurosymbolic AI spectrum. To that end, a systematic review is conducted, followed by bibliometric, descriptive and thematic analyses on the identified studies. Our findings indicate that researchers have primarily focused on the limited subset of neurofuzzy approaches, while some supply chain applications, such as performance evaluation and sustainability, and sectors such as pharmaceutical and construction have received less attention. To help address these gaps, we propose five pillars of neurosymbolic AI research for supply chains and provide four use cases of applying unexplored neurosymbolic AI approaches to address typical problems in supply chain management, including a discussion of prerequisites for adopting such technologies. We envision that the findings and contributions of this survey will help encourage further research in neurosymbolic AI for supply chains and increase adoption of such technologies within supply chain practice. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Default risk prediction presents a significant challenge for micro and small enterprises due to the unavailability of comprehensive information databases. This paper develops a default risk management tool based on user portrait theory, utilizing common and objective indicators of micro and small enterprises, such as basic information about entrepreneurs, enterprises, and loans. The Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method is employed to analyze the contribution of each indicator to default prediction. Empirical results show that household income and personal income are the two most important variables in general, with higher household income associated with a lower probability of default. However, a higher personal income is associated with a higher probability of default. Moreover, the importance of variables and the direction of their relationship with default prediction vary across samples. These findings provide significant insights for developing an accurate default prediction warning system for financial institution managers and policymakers, using the proposed methodology and technical framework. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Nonconformance (NCR) has long been a subject of research interest for its potential to extrapolate information leading to a more productive environment in construction projects. Despite a variety of traditional attempts, a systematic understanding of how machine learning (ML) approaches can contribute to proactively detecting the severity of NCRs remains limited. This study aims to develop a data-driven ML framework to predict the cost impacts of NCRs (high severity versus low severity) in construction projects. To accomplish this aim, the random forest (RF) algorithm reinforced with a metaheuristic hyperparameter-tuning strategy, namely the gravitational search algorithm (GSA), is adopted for the binary classification problem. Furthermore, this study incorporates the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) ensuring transparent interpretations into the GSA-RF predictive framework to tackle the inherent black-box nature of the ML rationale. The results reveal that the proposed model detects the severity of NCRs in terms of their cost impact with an overall AUROC value of 0.776 for the preseparated and blinded testing set. This indicates that the proposed model can be used confidently for newly introduced datasets from real-life cases. In addition, the SHAP analysis results emphasized the role of season, inadequate application procedure, and NCR type in detecting the severity of NCRs. Overall, this research not only makes an important contribution through its novel data-driven approaches but also provides insights for project managers concerning productivity improvements in the sector. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study investigates the relationship between the built environment and walking behavior for socially resilient urban design to promote walking in the aging population. We used a total of 117,259 GPS points and 160 person-day data points for elderly individuals living in Uijeongbu-si, Gyeonggi-do, Korea. The differences in the walking environments selected based on the walking purpose were analyzed using a random forest method, and the nonlinear relationship was investigated. In addition, an in-depth analysis was performed by adopting an interpretation approach from global and local perspectives. The findings highlight the significance of walking street pleasure and network properties for leisure walking. Specifically, a green area ratio of 15 % or more positively relationship path choice for leisure, underscoring the importance of sufficient green space. Conversely, the high proportion of green areas typically has negative implications for commercial walking. Road connectivity and integration are predominantly negatively associated with route choice for leisure, indicating a decreased preference for highly integrated roads during leisure walking activities. These findings provide valuable insights for an evidence-based urban design strategy to make walkable environments. It can contribute to urban planning and policy, particularly the development of tailored walkable environments for the older population. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The growing interest in the financial materiality of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) ratings has prompted recent investigations into their risk pricing impact in the corporate bond market. The specific implications for the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry have not been explored, as prior work has primarily focused on broad-based ESG integration. To fill this gap, our study employed an interpretable machine learning technique using a sample universe of U.S. corporate bonds spanning from 2010 to 2021 to estimate the impact of ESG ratings on corporate bond issuance spreads. The results revealed an average ESG benefit of 10 basis points across all sectors. However, it is important to note that the effects of ESG ratings on bond pricing demonstrate variation across sectors and individual ESG constituent ratings. Significantly, our findings show that social and governance ratings emerge as the primary drivers influencing bond issuance costs, whereas the impact of environmental scores is comparatively less significant. Within AEC-related industries, empirical data on the influence of ESG ratings indicate discounted pricing by the market is particularly channeled through environmental and governance scores. These findings emphasize the value-added impact of enhanced ESG performance on the cost of debt financing, presenting a financially material opportunity for operational and management decision-making. By adopting sustainable strategies to improve ESG performance, organizations in the AEC industry can potentially achieve lower costs of debt when issuing bonds to secure financing for construction projects. The managerial implications extend to policymakers, corporate managers, and creditors, as they all stand to benefit from the financial implications of ESG performance. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI), such as machine learning (ML) models, is profoundly impacting an organization's ability to assess safety risks during the construction of tunnels. Yet, ML models are black boxes and suffer from interpretability and transparency issues – they are unexplainable. Hence the motivation of this paper is to address the following research question: How can we effextively explain data-driven ML model's predicitve assessment of geotechnical risks in tunnel construction? We draw on the concept of ‘eXplainable AI’ (XAI) and utilize causal discovery and reasoning to help analyze and interpret the manifestation of geotechnical risks in tunnel construction by developing: (1) a sparse nonparametric and nonlinear directed acyclic diagram (DAG) used to determine the causal structure of risks between sub-systems; (2) a multiple linear regression model, which we use to estimate the effect of the causal relationships between sub-systems; and (3) a probability-based reasoning model to quantify and reason about risk. We use the San-yang Road tunnel project in Wuhan (China) to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed approach. The results indicate that our approach can accurately explain what and how risks are obtained from a data-driven probability-based ML model for ground settlement in tunnel construction. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - For condition monitoring and predictive maintenance of high-end manufacturing equipment, surface roughness is a critical metric to evaluate machining quality. Designing a method that can meet the requirements of on-machine monitoring tasks to confirm the cutters’ machinability is of great practical significance. Specifically, data-driven on-machine roughness measurement is a recently emerged non-contact method, which has the characteristics of non-invasive and high efficiency. However, recent studies indicate that, for the manufacturing sectors, the on-machine measurement processes are required to respect the predominant impact from the interference of ambient noise or shocks. Besides, the acquisition of microscopic morphology images such as white light interferometers (WLI) is still a relatively expensive and offline acquisition process. And the scale of available WLI data is limited for most industrial application cases. Considering the above-mentioned analysis, this paper proposes a new hybrid machine condition monitoring method based on interpretable dual tree methods, where the adopted interpretable decision tree models obtain knowledge from both topography analysis and acquired texture images of the white light interferometer. It couples with the Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) theory to analyze the main contribution features. The proposed method provides a promising solution to the poor interpretability of feature contribution analysis in general machine condition monitoring methods, which can accurately identify the machinery's physical states under various operating conditions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, we propose a new analysis method called Reverse contribution analysis (RCA) using approximate inverse model explanations (AIME) and use this method to clarify the relationship between remote work and mental health. AIME is an XAI method that visualizes the relationship between explanatory variables and estimated target variables for black-box models, making it possible to interpret the behavior of the model. Furthermore, if we assume an ideal black box model that can always derive accurate target variables, it becomes possible to directly visualize the contribution of target variables to explanatory variables. Based on this assumption, ICA quantitatively evaluates the contribution and direction of influence (positive or negative) of the explanatory variables based on the variability of the target variables. In this study, we used ICA to analyze which factors are related to work-life balance, stress levels, mental health status, and remote work satisfaction in a remote work environment. Specifically, we analyzed the impact of explanatory variables related to these objective variables using the Remote Work and Mental Health dataset, and the results showed that the industry, changes in productivity, experience and age are important factors. The results of this study provide important insights into improving remote work policies and employee support. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Agriculture plays a crucial role in Bangladesh's economy, with corn serving as a key crop. Plant diseases pose significant threats to agricultural productivity and economic stability worldwide. Effective monitoring and prediction are essential to mitigate these risks, as the prevalence of infectious diseases severely disrupts agricultural production. This study focuses on diagnosing agricultural diseases and pests affecting corn stalks using convolutional neural networks (CNN) combined with an SVM classifier. The proposed model achieves a classification accuracy of 98.34%, comparable to transfer learning models such as VGG-16 (97.42%) and VGG-19 (97.13%), while utilizing approximately 0.95 million parameters - about 145 times and 151 times fewer than VGG-16 and VGG-19, respectively. The model exhibits outstanding performance, with accuracy, recall, and F1 scores nearing 97% and an exceptional Area Under Curve (AUC) score of 99%. Furthermore, the model's compact design requires minimal disk space (approximately 4 MB) and features a significantly reduced parameter count. To enhance interpretability, the study integrates explainable AI techniques, including Gradient Weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME). These methods provide visual explanations through heatmaps, highlighting regions critical for classification, thereby facilitating a clearer understanding of the disease diagnosis process. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Clustering is one of the most popular unsupervised learning techniques in machine learning. It is used to recognize hidden patterns in data and group them accordingly. Data can be categorized using different clustering algorithms. However, there is no specific clustering algorithm that can be certified as the best in all cases. It is a matter of study which algorithm suits the best for a particular dataset. However, in contrast to the current literature, no study has been found to perform a cluster analysis based on a flood dataset, which has a significant impact on flood risk management. In this study, we have compared 10 clustering algorithms: k-means, bisecting k-means, fuzzy c-means, Gaussian mixture model (GMM), agglomerative, BIRCH, spectral, DBSCAN, OPTICS and mean shift according to 5 evaluation metrics: Rand index, silhouette score, Fowlkes-Mallows index, Davies-Bouldin index and Calinski-Harabasz index by applying them to a flood dataset in order to categorize data to identify flood. Moreover, optimal features from the flood dataset were selected based on random forest algorithm. The k-means is the best method for the dataset because it showed the best performance according to three of the five assessment measures. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to include the SHAP value analysis along with the means to interpret the results. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Leaf diseases are harmful conditions that affect the health, appearance and productivity of plants, leading to significant plant loss and negatively impacting farmers' livelihoods. These diseases cause visible symptoms such as lesions, color changes, and texture variations, making it difficult for farmers to manage plant health, especially in large or remote farms where expert knowledge is limited. The main motivation of this study is to provide an efficient and accessible solution for identifying plant leaf diseases in Bangladesh, where agriculture plays a critical role in food security. The objective of our research is to classify 21 distinct leaf diseases across six plants using deep learning models, improving disease detection accuracy while reducing the need for expert involvement. Deep Learning (DL) techniques, including CNN and Transfer Learning (TL) models like VGG16, VGG19, MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, ResNet50V2 and Xception are used. VGG19 and Xception achieve the highest accuracies, with 98.90% and 98.66% respectively. Additionally, Explainable AI (XAI) techniques such as GradCAM, GradCAM++, LayerCAM, ScoreCAM and FasterScoreCAM are used to enhance transparency by highlighting the regions of the models focused on during disease classification. This transparency ensures that farmers can understand the model's predictions and take necessary action. This approach not only improves disease management but also supports farmers in making informed decisions, leading to better plant protection and increased agricultural productivity. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Pumpkin leaf diseases are significant threats to agricultural productivity, requiring a timely and precise diagnosis for effective management. Traditional identification methods are laborious and susceptible to human error, emphasizing the necessity for automated solutions. This study employs on the "Pumpkin Leaf Disease Dataset", that comprises of 2,000 high-resolution images separated into five categories. Downy mildew, powdery mildew, mosaic disease, bacterial leaf spot, and healthy leaves. The dataset was rigorously assembled from several agricultural fields to ensure a strong representation for model training. We explored many proficient deep learning architectures, including DenseNet201, DenseNet121, DenseNet169, Xception, ResNet50, ResNet101 and InceptionResNetV2, and observed that ResNet50 performed most effectively, with an accuracy of 90.5% and comparable precision, recall, and F1-Score. We used Explainable AI (XAI) approaches like Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, Score-CAM, and Layer-CAM to provide meaningful representations of model decision-making processes, which improved understanding and trust in automated disease diagnostics. These findings demonstrate ResNet50's potential to revolutionize pumpkin leaf disease detection, allowing for earlier and more accurate treatments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The integration of carbon markets with the electricity sector represents a crucial development in aligning economic activities with environmental goals, particularly in China. Generation companies (GenCos) navigate these coupled markets through strategic bidding behaviors influenced by various carbon emission allowance (CEA) allocation methods. This study explores how different market conditions and regulatory policies shape GenCo bidding strategies, employing deep learning models like GAN to model these behaviors. To enhance interpretability, we utilize Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and introduce a Bayesian extension (BayLIME), which leverages empirical data and prior knowledge for a more robust analysis. The results demonstrate significant correlations between operational features and strategic dimensions, providing insights that could aid in optimizing market performance and ensuring compliance. The application of BayLIME particularly enhances the reliability and consistency of model explanations, offering a clearer understanding of market dynamics for stakeholders. The findings contribute to both strategic planning and policy-making efforts aimed at fostering a sustainable energy market. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding the association between metro ridership and the built environment is crucial for promoting integrated transportation and land use planning. However, prior research has rarely examined the temporally varying and/or non-linear associations between metro ridership and the built environment. To address this gap, this study collects metro ridership data in Chengdu, China, for January of each year between 2019 and 2022 and uses light gradient-boosting machine and SHapley Additive exPlanations models to examine the complex, non-linear associations between metro ridership and the built environment over 4 years. Our findings highlight the nonlinear nature of the built environment’s influence. The key predictors remained relatively stable throughout the years, including the number of entrances (the top predictor across all years), employment density, and the floor area ratio. However, the influence of built environment factors, such as land-use mix, residential micro-district density, and distance to the city center, shows great temporal variations, underscoring the importance of incorporating temporal dynamics into analyses of the interactions between metro ridership and the built environment. This study offers a valuable reference for urban and transportation planners in crafting tailored policies for station-area transit-oriented development. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The integration of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) into Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) holds the promise of transforming maintenance strategies across various industrial sectors by enhancing the interpretability and accuracy of predictive models. Despite progress, integrating XAI into PHM encounters hurdles, such as the absence of consistent methodologies and a unified framework, complicating the integration of these AI techniques into PHM systems. Additionally, the development of interpretable and robust health indicators (HIs) for systems with multiple components is still largely unexplored. It is hindered by the lack of benchmark data that fully represents system complexities, including component interdependencies and the variability of operational conditions. Therefore, this paper aims at addressing these challenges by offering two main contributions: a focused review of XAI in PHM and the introduction of a novel run-to-fail (RTF) dataset from the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP). This dataset is a leap forward, enabling the detailed monitoring of component degradation and the exploration of component interactions under various environmental conditions. It allows enhancing the development of explainable HIs and prognostics algorithms at the system level to better reflect the challenges faced in industrial settings. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper proposes two frameworks-Interpretive Structural Modelling with Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (ISM-LIME) and Knowledge Graph with LIME (KG-LIME)-to enhance interpretability in project risk management. While machine learning has proven to be a powerful tool for predicting and analyzing risks in increasingly complex projects, its”black box” nature often obscures decision-making processes. Current explainable AI (XAI) techniques, such as LIME, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), and G-LIME (Global-LIME), provide valuable insights into feature importance but struggle with capturing the intricate relationship and cascading effects among multiple risk factors. Our proposed frameworks address these limitations by not only elucidating the impact of individual risk factors and interpreting the antecedents but also by revealing their interconnections and cascading effects. Through a comparative analysis, this study demonstrates how ISM-LIME and KG-LIME overcome the shortcomings of traditional XAI methods. ISM-LIME offers a clear hierarchical representation of risk interactions, while KG-LIME provides a detailed network-based view that captures complex interdependencies. This comparison highlights the strengths of each approach in improving risk assessment and decision-making. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Predictive maintenance is crucial for optimizing industrial operations by reducing downtime and maintenance costs. We propose a novel approach integrating Federated Learning (FL) and Explainable AI (XAI) to enhance predictive maintenance in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments. Our methodology leverages decentralized sensor data from various IoT devices, including drones, across industrial plants to enable collaborative model training while ensuring data privacy. We utilize a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) federated algorithm for FL, which allows for the training of a global predictive maintenance model with local updates from each device, thereby improving model accuracy and adhering to strict data privacy regulations. Recognizing the opaque nature of many AI approaches, and the critical need for transparency in maintenance decision-making, we employ XAI techniques. Specifically, we utilize Counterfactual Explanations and Feature Importance Analysis with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), which provide interpretable explanations for maintenance predictions. These explanations empower industrial engineers and managers to understand how factors such as temperature, vibration, rotor speed, and environmental conditions like fog, dust, and smoke influence machinery performance. Our approach has been validated on operational datasets from manufacturing and process industries, demonstrating significant improvements in predicting equipment failures and optimizing maintenance actions. This contributes to advanced predictive maintenance strategies and efficient asset management in IIoT, showcasing a scalable framework that combines privacy, accuracy, and explainability. We have made all resources available on GitHub at https://github.com/Sarwar-UTS/-Industrial-Drones-in-the-Industrial-Internet-of-Things-Using-Federated-Learning-and-Explainable-AI to support and encourage future studies and advancements based on our findings. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Air pollination is important for plants like tomatoes as it plays a vital role in the reproduction and productivity of crops. Tomatoes, being predominantly selfpollinated, depend on airflow to transfer pollen from the anther to the stigma within the flower. In isolated environments like greenhouses, ensuring effective air pollination presents a significant challenge. Due to limited natural airflow, greenhouses often rely on mechanical ventilation systems which cannot adequately replicate the natural pollination process. In this work, a low-cost but efficient autonomous pollination system is developed for tomato plants in greenhouses that utilize both deep learning capability as well as robotic hardware manipulation. The deep learning model is based on the YOLOv8 Nano architecture that is customized with a transformer module which achieved an mAP@50 score of 9 4. 6 percent for mature flower detection. Explainable AI (XAI) like EigenCAM and XGrad-CAM approach showed correct visualization over the flower area with minimum noise. The developed model was implemented on the Nvidia Jetson Nano where the Bot-SORT tracking algorithm was used to avoid over-pollination of the same flower. For real-time application, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) app was developed which functioned together with the hardware system using closed-loop feedback control on a pan-tilt mechanism for targeting each mature tomato flower. This technique ensured consistent pollination throughout the day and offers efficiency, precision, and cost-effectiveness by increasing yield. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Sparse Tsetlin Machines (STMs) open up for assigning a small sample of the literals to each clause, and then permanently pruning those literals during learning through absorbing automata states. By trimming the STM in this manner, one can achieve a tenfold speed increase. However, when each clause is limited to the literal sample selected during clause creation, accuracy can drop. To reduce accuracy loss, we here introduce a scheme for streaming unallocated literals through the clauses. That is, the literals left out during clause construction are gradually integrated into the appropriate clauses throughout learning.That is, the literals left out during clause construction are gradually integrated into the appropriate clauses throughout learning. Each time an absorbing state eliminates a literal from a clause, a new unallocated one is added to that clause, placed in an insertion state. We study the effectiveness of the scheme at various degrees of sampling, varying the absorbing and insertion states. In particular, we investigate the effect of incorporating unallocated literal during learning. Across several benchmark datasets, we observe a boost in accuracy with sampling rates 5% and 20%. However, without literal streaming, the accuracy drops markedly for sampling rates 1% to 4%, which confirms the positive effect literal streaming has on STMs. In conclusion, literal streaming makes the Tsetlin Machine more scalable, yielding higher accuracy with fewer resources. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Current image processing methods typically operate at the finest granularity level-pixel level, which poses challenges in terms of efficiency and interpretability in deep neural models. Inspired by the idea of multi-granularity cognitive computing, we explore the construction of a multi-granularity representation for images, aiming to build efficient and interpretable deep learning models. In this work, we propose a method to represent images as graph, where each node represents a structural block in the image and each edge represents the association between two nodes. Specifically: (1) We have designed a gradient-based strategy to adaptively segment the image into several rectangular regions, where each region can be considered as a node. (2) Each node is connected to the nodes sharing the same region, and we have extracted image features corresponding to the nodes as attributes for each node. (3) Finally, all nodes and their corresponding edges form the graph representation of the digital image. In experiments, our method, combined with graph neural network (GNN), is applied to two benchmark datasets for image classification tasks. The results show that our proposed method significantly improves the learning and generalization of GNN models in computer vision tasks compared to previous studies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Management Information Systems (MIS) in today's sophisticated cyber risk landscape are at risk, exposing the need for sophisticated and adjustable security solutions to meet these threats. The framework proposed in this paper works to increase the accuracy and efficiency of cybercrimes identified and mitigated through an AI-enhanced framework. This study explores and implements dimensionality reduction via Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for high dimensional data handling and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) to increase model explainability using the CICIDS 2017 dataset. This approach enables cybersecurity professionals to understand the prediction because there is transparency, and it can trust the automated threat detection. Multiple machine learning models are evaluated, including XGBoost, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and K Nearest Neighbors (KNN). XGBoost achieved a near-perfect accuracy of 99.99% on these, and so might be able to classify these as they do cyber threats accurately. This proposed framework combines PCA and LIME in a new configuration specifically suited for real-time MIS applications: this makes it possible to achieve both high accuracy and interpretability in the face of various attack types using the CICIDS 2017 dataset. Considering interpretability, this analysis emphasizes cybersecurity in which transparent decision-making models allow professionals to understand, validate, and respond convincingly to detected anomalies. Combining robust interpretability tools with more advanced AI techniques can yield strengthened cybersecurity resilience in MIS and should be part of a client's toolbox. This framework integrates these methodologies to rapidly and accurately detect and manage real-time threats with explainability, thus improving MIS defenses against more sophisticated cyberattacks. This work provides the basis for future research, including model efficiency optimization and exploring other explainable AI techniques for broader cybersecurity applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Agricultural productivity is vital to global economic development and growth. When crops are affected by diseases, it adversely impacts a nation’s financial resources and agricultural output. Early detection of crop diseases can minimize losses for farmers and enhance production. Symptoms of diseases may take form in different parts of plants. However, the leaves, especially those of potatoes, are most commonly used in disease detection because they are buried deep in the ground. Deep learning-based CNN methods have become the standard for addressing most technical image identification and classification challenges. To improve training performance, the attention mechanism in deep learning helps the model concentrate on the informative data segments and extract the discriminative properties of inputs. This paper investigates spatial attention, which aims to highlight important local regions and extract more discriminative features. Moreover, the most pop ular CNN architectures, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121, and InceptionV3, were applied to transfer learning for potato disease classification and then fine-tuned by the publicly available dataset of PlantVillage. The exper iments reveal that the proposed Att-MobileNetV2 model performs better than other state-of-the-art methods. It achieves an identification F-measure of 98% on the test dataset, including images from Google. Finally, we utilized Grad-CAM++ in conjunction with the Att-MobileNetV2 method to provide an interpretable ex planation of the model’s performance. This approach is particularly effective in localizing the predicted areas, clarifying how CNN-based models identify the disease, and ultimately helping farmers trust the model’s pre dictions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Collaborative robots and machine learning-based virtual agents are increasingly entering the human workspace with the aim of increasing productivity and enhancing safety. Despite this, we show in a ubiquitous experimental domain, Overcooked-AI, that state-of-the-art techniques for human-machine teaming (HMT), which rely on imitation or reinforcement learning, are brittle and result in a machine agent that aims to decouple the machine and human's actions to act independently rather than in a synergistic fashion. To remedy this deficiency, we develop HMT approaches that enable iterative, mixed-initiative team development allowing end-users to interactively reprogram interpretable AI teammates. Our 50-subject study provides several findings that we summarize into guidelines. While all approaches underperform a simple collaborative heuristic (a critical, negative result for learning-based methods), we find that white-box approaches supported by interactive modification can lead to significant team development, outperforming white-box approaches alone, and that black-box approaches are easier to train and result in better HMT performance, highlighting a tradeoff between explainability and interactivity versus ease-of-training. Together, these findings present three important future research directions: 1) Improving the ability to generate collaborative agents with white-box models, 2) Better learning methods to facilitate collaboration rather than individualized coordination, and 3) Mixed-initiative interfaces that enable users, who may vary in ability, to improve collaboration. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The rising popularity of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to understand high-performing black boxes raised the question of how to evaluate explanations of machine learning (ML) models. While interpretability and explainability are often presented as a subjectively validated binary property, we consider it a multi-faceted concept. We identify 12 conceptual properties, such as Compactness and Correctness, that should be evaluated for comprehensively assessing the quality of an explanation. Our so-called Co-12 properties serve as categorization scheme for systematically reviewing the evaluation practices of more than 300 papers published in the past 7 years at major AI and ML conferences that introduce an XAI method. We find that one in three papers evaluate exclusively with anecdotal evidence, and one in five papers evaluate with users. This survey also contributes to the call for objective, quantifiable evaluation methods by presenting an extensive overview of quantitative XAI evaluation methods. Our systematic collection of evaluation methods provides researchers and practitioners with concrete tools to thoroughly validate, benchmark, and compare new and existing XAI methods. The Co-12 categorization scheme and our identified evaluation methods open up opportunities to include quantitative metrics as optimization criteria during model training to optimize for accuracy and interpretability simultaneously. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Heat pump systems coupled with Borehole heat exchanger (BHEx) are crucial for the efficient and cost-effective heating and cooling of buildings. Accurate performance forecasting of BHEx can help to reduce energy consumption, optimize system design, improve system reliability and ultimately contribute to the sustainability of the built environment. The performance of deep neural networks, including hybrid deep learning algorithms, is dependent on the number and true identification of input parameters used to train the model. While research on the accuracy and selection of individual deep neural networks is well-investigated, the impact of selected input parameters on hybrid algorithm selection and its subsequent influence on multi-step forecasting performance has not been quantified specifically for geothermal heating/cooling systems. The focus of the current work is to investigate and quantify this impact on multivariate hybrid deep learning algorithms for forecasting borehole heat exchanger outlet temperature. In the current work the developed hybrid AI models (LSTM-CNN, GRU-CNN, CNN-LSTM, CNN-GRU) have been trained, validated, and tested using the measured borehole-field data with variable number of input parameters (3,4,5 and 6). The validated AI models are used to forecast 24 h ahead performance of borehole heat exchanger to meet the heating and cooling loads. The most essential input parameters for the data-driven AI models are determined via an importance-level analysis by using Explainable AI techniques of Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). The findings show that increasing the number of input parameters has the potential to enhance the multi-step forecasting accuracy of the examined deep learning models. However, it is crucial to note that there is a point where including additional input parameters may not lead to further improvements. Therefore, it is essential to identify the optimal number of input parameters that can maximize the accuracy of the hybrid deep learning models. Moreover, the analysis highlights that depending on the architecture of specific model layers, it is possible to eliminate redundant weather sensors associated with time variables without compromising the accuracy of the hybrid deep learning models. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the development of exploration and trade, the coffee industry blossomed, and coffee gradually became an essential social drink for its unique taste and captivating aroma. Among various industrial coffee-producing processes, coffee bean classification is of great importance, which involves classifying beans into different qualities as multiple kinds of beans contain distinct characteristics, such as fermentation, sucrose, and sour degrees, influencing coffee beverage quality control, price setting, and even consumers' health. To the best of our knowledge, a prevailing approach for classification is machine learning based on neural networks. Unfortunately, even though high accuracy could be accomplished, it is hard to convey convincing results to researchers or industry personnel due to the 'black-box' property of the neural network, which indicates that we have little information about the inner mechanism in the neural network except for its inputs and outputs, jeopardizing the transparency and reliability of the neural network. Excellent interpretability is meaningful for retailers and consumers to know why the outputs are reliable. To begin with, in this paper, we will stress the importance of the high-accuracy classified coffee bean. Secondly, we will introduce the deep neural network technique to improve its high-accuracy classification. Last, we will demonstrate the XAI technique (GradCAM, etc.) to enhance explainability and interpretability. We improved the interpretability of the heatmap results produced by GradCAM and GradCAM++, and we also found out that they are presented differently. As XAI approaches, the versatile GradCAM provides high-resolution heatmaps to assist in understanding the regions of pictures that contribute much to the classification results, and the GradCAM++ produces much more precise results on accurately locating the contributing regions, including a better presentation of the unique distinct features of each class. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Perovskite-type lead-free piezoelectric ceramics allow access to illustrious piezoelectric coefficients (d <inf>33</inf>) through intricate composition design and experimental modulation. Developing a swift and accurate technology for identifying (K, Na)NbO<inf>3</inf> (KNN)-based ceramic compositions with high d <inf>33</inf> in exceedingly large “compositional” space will establish an innovative research paradigm surpassing the traditional empirical trial-and-error method. Herein, we demonstrate an interpretable machine learning (ML) framework for quick evaluation of KNN-based ceramics with high d <inf>33</inf> based on data from published literature. Specifically, a thorough feature construction was carried out from the global and local dimensions to establish tree regression models with d <inf>33</inf> as the target property. Subsequently, the feature-property mapping rules of KNN-based piezoelectric ceramics are further optimized through feature screening. To intuitively understand the correlation mechanisms between ML regression targets and features, the sure independence screening and sparsifying operator (SISSO) method was employed to extract the essential descriptors to explain d <inf>33</inf>. A straightforward descriptor, e(NMB−MVB)⋅ST/(IDA)2 , consisting of only four easily accessible parameters, can accelerate the evaluation of a series of novel KNN-based ceramics with high d <inf>33</inf> while exhibiting strong theoretical interpretability. This work not only provides a tool for the rapid discovery of high piezoelectric performance in KNN-based ceramics but also offers a data-driven route for the design of property descriptors in perovskites. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Logs are valuable information for oil and gas fields as they help to determine the lithology of the formations surrounding the borehole and the location and reserves of subsurface oil and gas reservoirs. However, important logs are often missing in horizontal or old wells, which poses a challenge in field applications. To address this issue, conventional methods involve supplementing the missing logs by either combining geological experience and referring data from nearby boreholes or reconstructing them directly using the remaining logs in the same borehole. Nevertheless, there is currently no quantitative evaluation for the quality and rationality of the constructed log. In this paper, we utilize data from the 2020 machine learning competition of the Society of Petrophysicists and Logging Analysts (SPWLA), which aims to predict the missing compressional wave slowness (DTC) and shear wave slowness (DTS) logs using other logs in the same borehole. We employ the natural gradient boosting (NGBoost) algorithm to construct an Ensemble Learning model that can predicate the results as well as their uncertainty. Furthermore, we combine the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) method to investigate the interpretability of the machine learning model. We compare the performance of the NGBosst model with four other commonly used Ensemble Learning methods, including Random Forest, GBDT, XGBoost, LightGBM. The results show that the NGBoost model performs well in the testing set and can provide a probability distribution for the prediction results. This distribution allows petrophysicists to quantitatively analyze the confidence interval of the constructed log. In addition, the variance of the probability distribution of the predicted log can be used to justify the quality of the constructed log. Using the SHAP explainable machine learning model, we calculate the importance of each input log to the predicted results as well as the coupling relationship among input logs. Our findings reveal that the NGBoost model tends to provide greater slowness prediction results when the neutron porosity (CNC) and gamma ray (GR) are large, which is consistent with the cognition of petrophysical models. Furthermore, the machine learning model can capture the influence of the changing borehole caliper on slowness, where the influence of borehole caliper on slowness is complex and not easy to establish a direct relationship. These findings are in line with the physical principle of borehole acoustics. Finally, by using the explainable machine learning model, we observe that although we did not correct the effect of borehole caliper on the neutron porosity log through preprocessing, the machine learning model assigned a greater importance to the influence of the caliper, achieving the same effect as caliper correction. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Ultrasonic metal welding (UMW) is a solid-state joining technology with widespread industrial applications. While UMW has numerous important advantages compared to traditional fusion-based welding methods, its performance can be substantially influenced by process anomalies such as tool degradation and material surface contamination, which are commonly encountered in industrial-scale productions. Recently, online monitoring has demonstrated excellent anomaly detection capabilities. However, the existing monitoring algorithms require a large amount of labeled data and lack the generalizability or adaptability to new process configurations (i.e., domains). This paper develops a meta-learning-based explainable few-shot learning (XFSL) framework that enables highly data-efficient adaptation of online monitoring algorithms to new process configurations with excellent explainability. We consider two distinct types of problems including tool condition monitoring and workpiece surface condition classification with varying UMW configurations. Using experimental data, we demonstrate that the proposed XFSL method achieves high classification performance in previously unseen target domains and significantly outperforms baseline methods. Furthermore, XFSL is able to evaluate the importance of each feature, thus revealing key features, feature types, and signal frequencies. It is shown that explainability-based feature selection can effectively eliminate unimportant information from monitoring signals while maintaining and even improving prediction performance. The proposed XFSL method is extensible to other manufacturing applications and holds significant potential for advancing the generalizability, adaptability, and agility of decision-making algorithms in modern manufacturing. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In the past decade, human digital twins (HDTs) attracted attention in both digital twin (DT) applications and beyond. In this paper, we discuss the concept and the development of HDTs, focusing on their architecture, key enabling technologies, and (potential) applications. Based on the literature, we identify personal data, model, and interface as three key modules in the proposed HDT architecture, supported by a data lake of human data and a model and interface library. Regarding the key enabling technologies that support the HDT functions, we envision that the internet of things (IoT) infrastructure, data security, wearables, human modeling, explainable artificial intelligence (AI) , minimum viable sensing, and data visualization are closely associated with the development of HDTs. Finally, we investigate current applications of HDTs, with a particular emphasis on the opportunities that arise from leveraging HDTs in the field of personalized product design. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - During virtual reality-based safety training, it is necessary to immediately and objectively evaluate personal learning performance. In light of this, this study proposed an interpretable machine learning approach for forecasting personal learning performance in VR-based construction safety training using real-time biometric responses. During VR-based safety training (‘fall accidents on scaffolding’), eye-tracking and EEG data were collected in real time from 30 participants (i.e., construction workers). The main findings can be summarized as follows. Compared to the full forecast model (FM), the support vector regression algorithm of the simplified forecast model (SM), which considers only principal features as independent variables, demonstrated better prediction performance (i.e., accuracy improvement: 0.087 of mean absolute error, overfitting: one-third level of the FM). This study creates new ground in the field of personalized safety training by enabling real-time monitoring and diagnosis for the cognitive states (i.e., learning performance) of construction workers during VR-based construction safety training. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The global attention to using timber products as sustainable construction material urges careful assessment of their performance against different hazards, particularly fire. However, the current methods prescribed by design codes for evaluating the fire resistance of timber components tend to underpredict the outcomes of standard fire resistance tests, and lack interpretability due to the use of semi-empirical equations. This study develops explainable data-driven models to predict fire resistance of timber columns using geometry- and material-related properties based on a comprehensive experimental database. Nine different single and ensemble-based machine learning algorithms were trained, and their performance was optimized through rigorous hyperparameter tuning and feature selection. The best models were then interpreted using partial dependence and Shapley plots to infer the underlying relationship between fire resistance and column properties. Lastly, the models’ predictive capabilities were compared to available prescriptive equations. The results show that a random forest-based model provides the best performance with an average ratio of predicted to observed fire resistance of 1.03 on the test set. The random forest prediction is mainly governed by column capacity at ambient temperature, and to a lesser degree, columns’ cross-section dimension. In addition, the partial dependence plots indicate that the effect of density, modulus of elasticity, length, and compressive strength on fire resistance was not notable. Finally, while the considered prescriptive equations consistently underpredict fire resistance, the random forest model provides a consistently accurate and balanced prediction. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Metal-based Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) has made fabricating intricate components easier. Yet, assessing part quality is inefficient, relying on costly Computed Tomography (CT) scans or time-consuming destructive tests. Also, intermittent inspection of layers also hampers machine productivity. The Additive Manufacturing (AM) field explores real-time quality monitoring using sensor signatures and Machine Learning (ML) to tackle this. One such approach is sensing airborne Acoustic Emissions (AE) from process zone perturbations and comprehending flaw formation for monitoring the LPBF process. This study emphasizes the importance of selecting airborne AE sensors for accurately classifying LPBF dynamics in 316 L, utilizing a flat response sensor to capture AE's during three regimes: Lack of Fusion, conduction mode, and keyhole. To comprehensively understand AE from a broad process space, the data was collected for two different 316 L stainless steel powder distributions (> 45 µm and < 45 µm) using two different parameter sets. Frequency analysis unveiled distinct LPBF dynamics as dominant and correlated in specific frequency ranges. Empirical Mode Decomposition was used to examine the periodicity of AE signals by separating them into constituent signals for comparison. Transformed AE signals were trained to distinguish regimes using ML classifiers (Convolutional Neural Networks, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machines). Sensitivity analysis using saliency maps and feature importance scores identified frequency information below 40 kHz relevant for decision-making. This study highlights interpretable machine learning's potential to identify critical frequency ranges for distinguishing LPBF regimes and underscores the importance of sensor selection for enhanced process monitoring. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Due to the growing interest for increasing productivity and cost reduction in industrial environment, new techniques for monitoring rotating machinery are emerging. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the approaches that has been proposed to analyze the collected data (e.g., vibration signals) providing a diagnosis of the asset's operating condition. Three major problems hinder the application of AI models in industrial environments, being the motivation for the research: (i) impossibility or long time to obtain a sample of all operational conditions (since faults rarely happen), (ii) high cost of experts to label all acquired data (in a supervised scenario) and (iii) lack of interpretability of the models (black-boxes). To overcome these problems, a new generic and interpretable approach for classifying faults in rotating machinery based on transfer learning from augmented synthetic data to real rotating machinery is here proposed, namely FaultD-XAI (Fault Diagnosis using eXplainable AI). To provide scalability using transfer learning, synthetic vibration signals are created mimicking the characteristic behavior of failures in operation. The application of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) with 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) allows the post hoc interpretation of results, supporting the user in decision making and increasing diagnostic confidence. The proposed approach not only obtained promising diagnostic performance but was also able to learn characteristics used by experts to identify conditions in a source domain and apply them in another target domain. The experimental results obtained on three datasets containing different mechanical faults suggest the method offers a promising approach on exploiting transfer learning, synthetic data and explainable artificial intelligence for fault diagnosis. Lastly, to guarantee reproducibility and foster research in the field, the developed dataset is made publicly available. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study aims to develop a new artificial intelligence model that can produce explainable rules to predict the mix design and early-age concrete compressive strength classes of recycled aggregate concrete (RAC). Unlike other black-box machine learning methods and rule-based algorithms, the study relies on a metaheuristic mechanism for explainability. This metaheuristic mechanism is not used for a traditional parameter optimization, but to automatically extract interpretable and interpretable rules from the experimental data. In the study, 30 series of RACs are produced, and the samples’ 1- and 3-day early-age concrete compressive strength values are determined. Concretes produced using these strength values are classified. The labels defined for each concrete class are Class A (C 8/10), Class B (C 12/15), Class C (C 16/20), and Class D (C 20/25). The proposed intelligent classification model that consists of rule set automatically produces interpretable and comprehensible rules from data to determine the early-age concrete compressive strength class and RAC mix amounts. In addition, the proposed method eliminates the black-box disadvantages of classical machine learning methods with its explainability and interpretability feature. The sunflower optimization algorithm is adapted as the metaheuristic mechanism and a special fitness function and representative solution form are developed for automatic extraction of high-quality comprehensible rules by simultaneously optimizing many different metrics. This paper is the first interpretable and comprehensible artificial intelligence model attempt used for early-age compressive strength classification and mixture design of recycled aggregate concrete by balancing and optimizing both the accuracy and explainability. Proposed explainable intelligent classification model is tested against both well-known state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms and standard rule-based methods on the produced real data. Promising results in terms of accuracy, precision, recall are obtained along with the explainability feature. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The technology development cycle continues to accelerate, and novelty analysis is becoming increasingly important for R&D planning as well as in the patent application process. Recently, thanks to significant advances in both text mining and natural language processing, researchers started to look into AI-assisted novelty analysis of technical content including patents. However, existing language models do not take into account the unique characteristics of technical elements in patent documents nor do they provide any explanation of their decisions including which technical elements represent a novelty. Therefore, we developed an eXplainable AI (XAI) model that evaluates novelty, takes into account the claim structure of a patent, and provides an explanation. The proposed framework of an XAI model for patent novelty consists of the following three parts: (1) dataset construction, (2) model architecture, and (3) inference process. The training dataset for patent novelty is constructed using a full-text dataset provided by the European Patent Office (EPO). A self-explainable novelty classification model is proposed and investigated. Using the fitted model, the inference results are then analyzed by extracting patents in the field of vehicle communication networks. The inference process is done by applying the fitted model to patents in the vehicle communication network field and can be expanded to address potential applications. The performance of the proposed model is then verified by comparing it with the results of similar studies. We also discuss practical applications from the perspective of patent examiners and technical planning practitioners. This study involves both an academic contribution that uses a novel approach to technology management via an XAI model and a practical contribution that can be used for patent analysis. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The increase in global population and urbanization is presenting significant challenges to society: space is becoming increasingly scarce, demand is exceeding capacity for deteriorating infrastructure, transportation is fraught with congestion, and environmental impacts are accelerating. Underground space, and particularly tunnels, has a key role to play in tackling these challenges. However, the cost, risk, uncertainty, and complexity of the tunneling process have impeded its growth. In this paper, we envision several technological advancements that can potentially innovate and transform the mechanized tunneling industry, including artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous, and bio-inspired systems. The proliferation of AI may assist human engineers and operators in making informed decisions systematically and quantitatively based on massive real-time data during tunneling. Autonomous tunneling systems may enable precise and predictable tunneling operations with minimal human intervention and facilitate the construction of massive and large-scale underground infrastructure projects that were previously challenging or unfeasible using conventional methods. Bio-inspired systems may provide valuable references and strategies for more efficient tunneling design and construction concepts. While these technological advancements can offer great promise, they also face considerable challenges, such as improving accessibility to and shareability of tunneling data, developing robust, reliable, and explainable machine learning systems, as well as scaling the mechanics and ensuring the applicability of bio-inspired systems from the prototype level to real-world applications. Addressing these challenges is imperative to ensure the successful implementation of these innovations for future tunneling. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Occupant presence and their behaviour in the built environment significantly impact energy consumption in buildings. Currently, building systems are often operated based on assumed occupancy and fixed schedules, or occupants manually adjust them for their comfort, which sometimes leads to energy wastage. Also, the inherent complexity and unpredictability of occupancy patterns can contribute to disparities between simulated and actual energy consumption, underscoring the importance of selecting suitable methods for occupancy prediction. Various methods, such as occupancy cameras, thermal imagers, Passive Infrared Sensors, and Radio-Frequency Identification, can collect occupancy information. However, they often come with limitations including cost, complexity, and invasiveness. Hence, there is a growing interest in creating occupancy prediction models using an indirect approach based on indoor air quality (IAQ) data. However, this indirect approach must be further explored within the building simulation field. In this study, we apply an approach based on the novel QLattice algorithm for occupancy detection, utilizing a minimal sensing strategy with a comprehensive set of IAQ data. Furthermore, we compare the QLattice algorithm's performance with that of traditional machine learning (ML) algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees (DT), and XGBoost using metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, AUC-ROC values, and computational time. The QLattice algorithm outperforms traditional ML algorithms in all evaluation metrics, achieving over 90% accuracy on the test dataset. Additionally, compared to traditional black-box ML algorithms, QLattice stands out for its explainability and interpretability, providing insights useful in decision-making. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite the global sustainability trend, airport buildings have received limited attention regarding their environmental impact within the built environment and aviation sectors. With less than 1% of green building certifications worldwide, there is a lack of essential green performance assessment tools, including frameworks, primary datasets, and models that require less human supervision. Previous research has addressed these issues by proposing frameworks, primary datasets, and a supervised method that leverages Classification and Regression Trees. However, these methods still rely on human effort to fix credit scores and assign category weights, necessitating significant supervision from human experts. This study presents a green performance evaluation model for airport buildings using an explainable semi-supervised AI approach to reduce human dependency during the inference of green scores. Principal Component Analysis and Hierarchical Clustering algorithms (agglomerative and divisive) are employed to construct the models. The dataset's dimensionality is reduced based on metrics such as scatter coefficient, Psi Index, variation, and permutation. The cluster numbers are determined using elbow point and silhouette coefficient values, resulting in cluster initializations between 6 and 12. Performance measures, including the rand index, mean absolute error, precision, recall, F1-measure, and accuracy, are evaluated for the models. The AHC and DHC models exhibit a maximum accuracy of 74%, albeit with different cluster numbers. Consequently, models are developed with suitable cluster numbers to derive green rules with improved predictive accuracy. Each agglomerative and divisive hierarchical clustering model yields 12 practical green rules that can assist airport operators and facility managers in enhancing the green performance of their airport buildings. These explainable green rules serve as guidelines to improve airport facilities. Additionally, a web-based green rating tool is developed to demonstrate the proof-of-concept, utilizing the green rules extracted from the agglomerative model. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Pluvial flash floods are fast-moving hazards and causes significant disruptions in urban areas. This study presents interpretable machine learning models for predicting urban flash flood hotspots based on intertwined land and built environment features. Various features related to land and built environment characteristics are constructed using diverse datasets, and the occurrences of flash floods are captured using crowdsource data from the events. Using these features and datasets, the flash flood hotspots of cities are predicted with two ensemble models based on decision trees. The results demonstrate that the models can achieve good accuracy in identifying flooded/non-flooded locations. The model interpretation results indicate that land features related to hydrological and topological features have greater impacts on flash flood risk, than built environment features. The data-driven machine learning models presented in this study provide a useful tool for predicting flash flood hotspots based on the intertwined features of land and the built environment in cities to enable nowcasting and proactive monitoring of flash flood hotspots for emergency response and also inform integrated urban design and development towards flash flood risk reduction. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Steel bridges are widely used in bridge engineering. In the structural design of steel bridge deck pavement systems, engineers focus on obtaining mechanical properties by calculating design parameters and are keen to establish a quick and accurate solution method. Because of the complex knowledge system involved in the numerical calculation method, it is difficult for the general engineering designer to master it. Researchers have started using artificial intelligence algorithms to solve problems in civil engineering. This study developed an XGBoost-based mechanical performance prediction model for steel bridge deck pavement systems. First, numerical simulation tests are conducted at unfavorable load locations using a finite element model to establish a dataset. Then, an XGBoost model is built using this dataset, and its parameters are optimized and compared with traditional machine learning models. Finally, an explanatory analysis of the model is performed using SHAP, an interpretable machine learning framework. The results indicate that the developed XGBoost model accurately predicts the mechanical properties of steel bridge deck pavement systems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Quality assurance (QA) plays a crucial role in manufacturing to ensure that products meet their specifications. However, manual QA processes are costly and time-consuming, thereby making artificial intelligence (AI) an attractive solution for automation and expert support. In particular, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have gained a lot of interest in visual inspection. Next to AI methods, the explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) systems, which achieve transparency and interpretability by providing insights into the decision-making process of the AI, are interesting methods for achieveing quality inspections in manufacturing processes. In this study, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to explore AI and XAI approaches for visual QA (VQA) in manufacturing. Our objective was to assess the current state of the art and identify research gaps in this context. Our findings revealed that AI-based systems predominantly focused on visual quality control (VQC) for defect detection. Research addressing VQA practices, like process optimization, predictive maintenance, or root cause analysis, are more rare. Least often cited are papers that utilize XAI methods. In conclusion, this survey emphasizes the importance and potential of AI and XAI in VQA across various industries. By integrating XAI, organizations can enhance model transparency, interpretability, and trust in AI systems. Overall, leveraging AI and XAI improves VQA practices and decision-making in industries. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Employee attrition and high turnover have become critical challenges faced by various sectors in today’s competitive job market. In response to these pressing issues, organizations are increasingly turning to artificial intelligence (AI) to predict employee attrition and implement effective retention strategies. This paper delves into the application of explainable AI (XAI) in identifying potential employee turnover and devising data-driven solutions to address this complex problem. The first part of the paper examines the escalating problem of employee attrition in specific industries, analyzing the detrimental impact on organizational productivity, morale, and financial stability. The second section focuses on the utilization of AI techniques to predict employee attrition. AI can analyze historical data, employee behavior, and various external factors to forecast the likelihood of an employee leaving an organization. By identifying early warning signs, businesses can intervene proactively and implement personalized retention efforts. The third part introduces explainable AI techniques which enhance the transparency and interpretability of AI models. By incorporating these methods into AI-based predictive systems, organizations gain deeper insights into the factors driving employee turnover. This interpretability enables human resources (HR) professionals and decision-makers to understand the model’s predictions and facilitates the development of targeted retention and recruitment strategies that align with individual employee needs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Reflectance-based photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensors provide flexible options of measuring sites for blood oxygen saturation (SpO<inf>2</inf>) measurement. But they are mostly limited by accuracy, especially when applied to different subjects, due to the diverse human characteristics (skin colors, hair density, etc.) and usage conditions of different sensor settings. This study addresses the estimation of SpO<inf>2</inf> at non-standard measuring sites employing reflectance-based sensors. It proposes an automated construction of subject inclusion-exclusion criteria for SpO<inf>2</inf> measuring devices, using a combination of unsupervised clustering, supervised regression, and model explanations. This is perhaps among the first adaptation of SHAP to explain the clusters gleaned from unsupervised learning methods. As a wellness application case study, we developed a pillow-based wearable device to collect reflectance PPGs from both the brachiocephalic and carotid arteries around the neck. The experiment was conducted on 33 subjects, each under totally 80 different sensor settings. The proposed approach addressed the variations of humans and devices, as well as the heterogeneous mapping between signals and SpO<inf>2</inf> values. It identified effective device settings and characteristics of their applicable subject groups (i.e., subject inclusion-exclusion criteria). Overall, it reduced the root mean squared error (RMSE) by 16%, compared to an empirical formula and a plain SpO<inf>2</inf> estimation model. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this case study, we introduce two ML techniques, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and an optimized Random Forest (RF), to address challenges related to capacity and cost, by addressing problems of unscheduled downtime and Process Time (PT) variation in the case of a complex chamber processing tool. We show that by using these ML techniques, traditional methods of Predictive Maintenance (PdM) and PT analysis can be enhanced with new insights and lead to significant productivity improvements. We demonstrate that, with these methods, by detecting states and attributes of the tool, trends in the tool's behavior can be more effectively identified to reduce its unscheduled downtime and improve its run-rate, thereby resulting in significant capacity and cost improvements. This is achieved by reducing the variability of availability; extending the Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF); and removing variability in PT between lots and chambers. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the inadequate readiness of numerous nations to address diseases that could potentially evolve into epidemics or pandemics, posing risks to health systems and supply chains. Statistical analysis and predictive models were developed to manage COVID-19 and other diseases that harm public health. However, few public-policy decision-support tools are documented in the literature, although several governments have created them. In line with the previous developments, this tool uses socioeconomic features to model the COVID-19 province's mortality rates. This paper presents a tool to predict the mortality rate of a province using supervised learning techniques, named CuraZone. This tool was validated using 196 provinces in Peru for training and considering 31 characteristics. The tool displays the dataset's most essential characteristics, shows the country's mean square error (MSE), and predicts a province's mortality rate. In addition, the tool contributes to the field of Explainable AI (XAI), as it shows the importance of each feature. Highlighted contributions of this work include the support for the decision-making of governments or stakeholders in epidemics, providing the source code in an open and reproducible way, and the estimated mortality rate for specific populations of a neighborhood, city, or country. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Automated Machine Learning-based systems’ integration into a wide range of tasks has expanded as a result of their performance and speed. Although there are numerous advantages to employing ML-based systems, if they are not interpretable, they should not be used in critical or high-risk applications. To address this issue, researchers and businesses have been focusing on finding ways to improve the explainability of complex ML systems, and several such methods have been developed. Indeed, there are so many developed techniques that it is difficult for practitioners to choose the best among them for their applications, even when using evaluation metrics. As a result, the demand for a selection tool, a meta-explanation technique based on a high-quality evaluation metric, is apparent. In this paper, we present a local meta-explanation technique which builds on top of the truthfulness metric, which is a faithfulness-based metric. We demonstrate the effectiveness of both the technique and the metric by concretely defining all the concepts and through experimentation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have become a common choice for industrial quality control, as well as other critical applications in the Industry 4.0. When these CNNs behave in ways unexpected to human users or developers, severe consequences can arise, such as economic losses or an increased risk to human life. Concept extraction techniques can be applied to increase the reliability and transparency of CNNs through generating global explanations for trained neural network models. The decisive features of image datasets in quality control often depend on the feature’s scale; for example, the size of a hole or an edge. However, existing concept extraction methods do not correctly represent scale, which leads to problems interpreting these models as we show herein. To address this issue, we introduce the Scale-Preserving Automatic Concept Extraction (SPACE) algorithm, as a state-of-the-art alternative concept extraction technique for CNNs, focused on industrial applications. SPACE is specifically designed to overcome the aforementioned problems by avoiding scale changes throughout the concept extraction process. SPACE proposes an approach based on square slices of input images, which are selected and then tiled before being clustered into concepts. Our method provides explanations of the models’ decision-making process in the form of human-understandable concepts. We evaluate SPACE on three image classification datasets in the context of industrial quality control. Through experimental results, we illustrate how SPACE outperforms other methods and provides actionable insights on the decision mechanisms of CNNs. Finally, code for the implementation of SPACE is provided. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Current national occupational safety and health (OSH) initiatives follow reactive approaches, i.e., if it breaks, fix it. Existing accounts, however, failed to improve national OSH performances substantially, which imposes the need for an in-depth and proactive (fix it so it will not break) investigation of national occupational fatality risks. Despite many studies examining the fatality risk of workers based on project-, company-, and/or behavior-related factors, the role of national conditions on the countrywide fatality risk of workers has not been explored. The present research leverages the national statistics of Turkey to examine their influence on construction workers' fatality risk through a machine learning-based prediction model. Several widely used machine learning methods were adopted for determining whether the upcoming month poses a significant fatality risk for construction workers or not based on national statistics of the previous month. According to analysis results, the gradient boosting decision tree algorithm yielded the highest prediction performance in terms of f1-score. The recently developed game theory-based Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) algorithm was used to identify whether and how national conditions affect countrywide fatality risk of construction workers. Findings illustrate that the share of the construction sector in employment, market demand, and labor shortage are the most significant national factors in determining the fatality risk. SHAP summary and SHAP dependence plots are further presented to provide decision makers with a clearer understanding of hidden relationships between fatality risk and national conditions. In addition, a framework that can be practically used by policy makers and governmental authorities is developed to help minimize national occupational fatality risk. Overall, predicting national fatality risk in the industry and identifying the national precursors of occupational fatalities contribute to the development of macrolevel safety improvements based on country-specific conditions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding the mode substitution of shared micro-mobility systems is essential for assessing their societal and environmental impact and developing improvement planning instruments. This study carries out a fine-grained analysis of the mode substitution of dockless bike sharing (DLBS) in relation to other transport modes at the trip level, leveraging multi-modal route planning techniques, transaction data of bike-sharing, and travel behavior modeling. More importantly, the study leverages interpretable machine learning to reveal the complex effects of built environment factors on the mode substitution patterns of DLBS based on multiple data sources. The results indicate that the probabilities of DLBS replacing other transport modes present large heterogeneity among different trips and in different urban contexts, which can be successfully quantified by the proposed approach at the trip level. The average substitution rates of bike-sharing to bus, metro, walking and ride-hailing in Shanghai are estimated to be 0.356, 0.116, 0.347 and 0.181, respectively. Built environment factors such as presence of transit systems can explain the variations in the substitution rates of DLBS to a certain transport mode in different urban contexts. Especially, the effects of some built environment factors show complex nonlinear and threshold patterns revealed by the data-driven method. The effects of key built environment factors are quantitatively interpreted and their practical implications discussed. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents a new method for objectively measuring the explainability of textual information, such as the outputs of Explainable AI (XAI). We introduce a metric called Degree of Explainability (DoX), drawing inspiration from Ordinary Language Philosophy and Achinstein's theory of explanations. It assumes that the degree of explainability is directly proportional to the number of relevant questions that a piece of information can correctly answer. We have operationalized this concept by formalizing the DoX metric through a mathematical formula, which we have integrated into a software tool named DoXpy. DoXpy relies on pre-trained deep language models for knowledge extraction and answer retrieval in order to estimate the DoX, transforming our theoretical insights into a practical tool for real-world applications. To confirm the effectiveness and consistency of our approach, we conducted comprehensive experiments and user studies with over 190 participants. These studies evaluated the quality of explanations by healthcare and finance XAI-based software systems. Our results demonstrate a correlation between increases in objective explanation usability and increments in the DoX score. These findings suggest that the DoX metric is congruent with other mainstream explainability measures. It provides a more objective and cost-effective alternative to non-deterministic user studies. Thus, we discuss the potential of DoX as a tool to evaluate the legal compliance of XAI systems. By bridging the gap between theory and practice in Explainable AI, our work fosters transparency, understandability, and legal compliance. DoXpy and related materials have been made available online to ensure reproducibility. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In the era of data-driven decision-making, Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) can greatly benefit from the potential of explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to provide transparent and interpretable insights. This paper presents the KONX (CONNECTS) approach, a methodology that leverages semantic web technologies to create a dynamic and comprehensive knowledge graph for advanced predictive models in academic advising. The KONX methodology focuses on harmonizing heterogeneous educational data sources, enabling seamless data querying and manipulation. By incorporating a feedback mechanism, the KONX approach remains adaptable to changes in the academic domain, continuously updating and maintaining its knowledge representation. To practically apply and evaluate the proposed methodology, a prototype was implemented and tested on an experimental case study concerning student outcomes prediction. The implemented prototype includes a graphical SPARQL generator interface to streamline the construction of SPARQL queries in an integrated way. In this way, this paper proposes both a comprehensive XAI methodology and a holistic technological infrastructure for applying the methodology in real-time scenarios. By bridging the gap between AI decision-making and human-comprehensible explanations, the KONX approach enhances transparency and user trust in AI-driven systems in the education sector. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Approximately 40% of total energy demand in the European Union is consumed by the residential buildings sector, thus also significantly contributing to carbon dioxide emissions. Circa 28% of this energy demand is attributed to space heating and cooling, primarily influenced by the building's envelope and need to ensure indoor thermal comfort. Given this significant energy consumption, there is an urgent imperative to explore energy-saving strategies and develop tools to assess the effects of various design alternatives, with a focus on wall and roof characteristics. While existing white and black-box predictive models lack generalisation capabilities, the goal of this study is to develop and train a domain-informed grey-box Deep Learning model called Temp-AI-Estimator to predict the indoor temperature of buildings and containers (acting as surrogates for residential or office buildings as well as intermodal containers) based on measurements of external meteorological conditions (e.g. exterior temperature, humidity, etc.), as well as physical properties due to building construction set-ups in questions (“ThermoProtect” (thin coating), “ThermoActive” (thick coating) and thermal insulation). The major difficulty lies in making the model generalise beyond the three geographical locations included in the dataset (Berlin, Abu Dhabi, Texel). Experiments with LSTMs and Transformers as baseline models showed overfitting on the particular conditions at the sites in the training set, while failing to generalise to a new out-of-sample location. We propose to pass the model the numerical derivatives of the time-sequences, as these are less location-specific. The estimation of the necessary initial/final conditions is delegated to a very small network to minimise the risk of overfitting. Furthermore, we included a physically motivated module for modelling the latency and difference in amplitudes between exterior conditions and interior temperatures, informed by numerical approximation schemes of the differential equation of thermal conduction. Our experiments show that our domain-informed network achieves an increase in accuracy of almost 40% in addition to yielding results that can easily be inspected by human experts due to interpretability and explainability. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - There is a growing need for public speaking skills in both professional and private life. With this background, our research project's long-term aims are to develop tools that can analyse public speeches and provide helpful feedback. The impact of audio and visual characteristics on the automatic analysis of speech quality has been widely explored in the existing literature. However, only a few studies have focused on textual features. In response to this shortcoming, this paper investigates the importance of textual content for the automatic analysis of public speaking. We created an open-source Python library of textual features and integrated them as inputs of simple machine-learning models for automatic public-speaking analysis, and persuasiveness prediction, in particular. The best result (accuracy of ) is obtained using a logistic regression. We then evaluated the impact of these features on persuasiveness prediction using both correlation analysis and Explainable AI methods. This evaluation was conducted on the French data set 3MT_French, including student performances in the "Ma Thèse en 180 Secondes"competition. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Self-Compacting Concrete (SCC) has gained significant popularity due to its exceptional workability performance. However, designing SCC poses more challenges than ordinary concrete, as it must fulfill requirements for filling ability, passing ability, and segregation resistance. Regrettably, existing test techniques lack the ability to simultaneously evaluate all these properties, and relying on experiential knowledge and cognition without tangible physical meaning. Although rheology examines the flow and deformation of fluid materials and is closely related to SCC's properties, the relationship between SCC composition, rheology, and properties remains unclear due to the complexity of the factors involved and the absence of effective tools. This study introduces a novel approach by utilizing a random forest algorithm to create multiple interpretable machine learning models for predicting the rheology, workability, and mechanical properties of SCC. Additionally, SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) and Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) methods were integrated with the models to analyze how SCC composition impacts its properties by altering the rheology of the mixture. The models exhibit high accuracy in predicting both rheology and SCC properties (R2 = 0.93 ∼ 0.98, Index of Agreement = 0.92 ∼ 0.99). According to the SHAP and PDP analysis, yield stress and plastic viscosity were negatively correlated with slump flow, L-box ratio, and segregation rate, while exhibiting a positive correlation with V-funnel time and strength. Furthermore, the dependence of the segregation rate on yield stress was observed to be stronger at relatively low yield stress levels (below 40 Pa). These models provide valuable insights for designing and evaluating SCC mixtures tailored to specific requirements. Additionally, the study explores underlying mechanisms and offers guidelines for proportioning SCC in different design scenarios. The findings contribute to the advancement of SCC technology and have significant implications for the construction industry. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Timing design rule check (T-DRC) convergence follows an iterative procedure like physical design closure. On a medium-complex design, the conventional flow of T-DRC convergence requires about 14 h per iteration, which includes fill insertion, sign-off accurate standard parasitic extraction format generation, sign-off static timing analysis, engineering change order (ECO) list generation in the multi-corner multi-mode scenario, fill removal, and implementation of the ECO on the pre-fill design. The T-DRC values generated from the pre-fill stage auto-place and route tool often have a miscorrelation with the sign-off values obtained from the static timing analysis tool. Due to the correlation gap, designers prefer to wait for the ECO change list to be created by the sign-off tool at the end of each iteration rather than resolve it at the pre-fill stage in the construction tool. Hence, T-DRC convergence is a lengthy process. This paper discusses an automatic T-DRC convergence methodology driven by machine learning (ML) techniques. By anticipating the transition of the input pin of a cell and the capacitance of its output pin, the suggested methodology shortens the runtime of each iteration. Additionally, it forecasts the suitable buffer to correct the T-DRC violation in the case of buffer insertion. With almost accurate prediction of T-DRC values using the ML approach, the sign-off flow can now be bypassed for a few iterations during the timing convergence phase, resulting in fewer iterations in the T-DRC sign-off flow. The violation percentage and the desired buffer name are obtained from the ML prediction result for each violation. An automatic in-house T-DRC fixer flow is developed to correct the violating elements beforehand, saving around 12 h of runtime for each iteration. Since ML prediction can never be 100% accurate, the final timing sign-off should always be done with the sign-off tool and flow to ensure zero silicon bug. With the help of ML prediction and the T-DRC fixer methodology, T-DRC convergence is possible in fewer sign-off tool iterations, resulting in a left shift of about two weeks in the timing closure cycle on the actual project execution. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Machine Learning models have been frequently used in transcriptome analyses. Particularly, Representation Learning (RL), e.g., autoencoders, are effective in learning critical representations in noisy data. However, learned representations, e.g., the “latent variables” in an autoencoder, are difficult to interpret, not to mention prioritizing essential genes for functional follow-up. In contrast, in traditional analyses, one may identify important genes such as Differentially Expressed (DiffEx), Differentially Co-Expressed (DiffCoEx), and Hub genes. Intuitively, the complex gene-gene interactions may be beyond the capture of marginal effects (DiffEx) or correlations (DiffCoEx and Hub), indicating the need of powerful RL models. However, the lack of interpretability and individual target genes is an obstacle for RL’s broad use in practice. To facilitate interpretable analysis and gene-identification using RL, we propose “Critical genes”, defined as genes that contribute highly to learned representations (e.g., latent variables in an autoencoder). As a proof-of-concept, supported by eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), we implemented eXplainable Autoencoder for Critical genes (XA4C) that quantifies each gene’s contribution to latent variables, based on which Critical genes are prioritized. Applying XA4C to gene expression data in six cancers showed that Critical genes capture essential pathways underlying cancers. Remarkably, Critical genes has little overlap with Hub or DiffEx genes, however, has a higher enrichment in a comprehensive disease gene database (DisGeNET) and a cancer-specific database (COSMIC), evidencing its potential to disclose massive unknown biology. As an example, we discovered five Critical genes sitting in the center of Lysine degradation (hsa00310) pathway, displaying distinct interaction patterns in tumor and normal tissues. In conclusion, XA4C facilitates explainable analysis using RL and Critical genes discovered by explainable RL empowers the study of complex interactions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Advances on the construction front continue to rise as the next industrial revolution (Construction 4.0) nears. One promising front revolves around additively fabricated or simply 3D printed concrete. The growing number of ongoing parallel research programs has now made it possible to collect a large amount of data on such concrete as, up to this point, the open literature lacks a comprehensive database. Thus, this paper presents the largest database spanning over 300 experiments on 3D printed concrete. This database is then examined via multilinear regression as well as two explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) algorithms, namely, Random Forest and XGBoost, to arrive at a working model capable of predicting the compressive strength property for 3D concrete mixtures that incorporate the following seven features: age of specimens, as well as the magnitude of cement, water, fly ash, silica fume, fine aggregate, and superplasticizer. Findings from this work infer the superiority of XAI models in predicting the strength property of 3D printed concrete. Our analysis identifies two features, namely, the age of specimens and the quantity of fine aggregate, as the most important features that can accurately predict the compressive strength property. Finally, the deployed explainability methods successfully quantified the highly nonlinear relations between the selected features and compressive strength, and this newly acquired knowledge can help tailor functional concrete mixtures. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding the spatial relationship between watershed properties and water quality is essential for watershed management. However, it remains challenging to identify such a relationship because of its nonlinearity. To understand the temporal and spatial effects of the driving of water quality, a grid-based interpretable machine learning approach was developed to explore the relationship between water quality (i.e. nitrogen, phosphorus, and chemical oxygen demand) and watershed properties in the Minjiang River Watershed (MRW). A grid-based model was developed with 1837 input features for streams and reservoirs, respectively, based on land use, population, fertilizer, and Noah land surface model in the MRW. Compared to the water quality in the stream, the water quality in the reservoirs may be more sensitive to the change environmental settings. The reservoirs may amplify the effects of climate variability on water quality. The soil moisture may modify the water quality, especially the dryness of the top soil may control the pollutant that entry into the watershed. The effects of the urbanization may modify the distributions of important feature that control the regional water quality. The point source pollution per inhabitant may be reduced with increasing urbanization. This study provides an in-depth understanding of the relationship between water quality and watershed properties, temporally and spatially. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Penetration rate prediction of Tunnel Boring Machines (TBM) is critical for understanding excavation performances. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of developing machine learning models that accurately predict the Penetration Rate of a TBM using only machine parameters. We leveraged two datasets collected from the Exploratory and Main excavation of the Lot Mules 2–3 of the Brenner Base Tunnel Project. We compared the performance of two different Artificial Neural Network architectures, one based on feedforward architecture and the other on long short-term memory (LSTM). We also studied which features lead to a good estimation of the penetration rate using SHAP, an explainable AI tool, discovering that the Specific Energy (SE) and the Cutterhead Power (CP) are the most impactful features. We also explore the possibility of performing cross-tunnel prediction by training the model on the Exploratory tunnel and testing it on the Main Tunnel, obtaining promising results. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Digital Twins (DTs), being the virtual replicas of their physical counterparts, share valuable knowledge of the underlying physical processes and act as data acquisition and dissemination sources to Cyber–Physical System (CPS). Moreover, without obstructing the ongoing operations, DTs also provide an assessment platform for evaluating the operational behavior and security of the CPS. Therefore, they become a potential source of data breaches and a broad attack surface for attackers to launch covert attacks. To detect and mitigate security loopholes in DTs, one of the potential solutions is to leverage a gamification approach that can assess the security level of DTs while providing security analysts with a controlled and supportive virtual training environment. Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML)-based approaches can complement the idea of security orchestration and automation in the gamification approach. However, AI/ML-based DTs security solutions are generally constrained by the lack of transparency of AI operations, which results in less confidence in the decisions made by the AI models. To address the explainable security challenges of DTs, this article proposes a gamification approach called sEcuriNg dIgital twins through GaMification Approach (ENIGMA). While leveraging DTs as an offensive security platform, ENIGMA provides gaming scenarios to assess DTs’ security and train security analysts. The game players within ENIGMA are humans (the attacker team) and AI agents (the defender team). Furthermore, ENIGMA is supported by an eXplainable AI (XAI)-based DT security assessment model that explains the decisions made based on the SHAP values by the AI model on attack vectors for the defender team, i.e., the AI agent. The SHAP values illustrate the contribution of different features towards predicting the outcome of attack vectors. This explanation can help security analysts to take security measures based on reasoned and trustworthy decisions. Finally, experimental validation has been carried out to demonstrate the viability of ENIGMA. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms have outperformed traditional approaches in various forecasting applications, especially electricity price forecasting (EPF). However, the prediction accuracy of ML reduces substantially if the input data is not similar to the ones seen by the model during training. This is often observed in EPF problems when market dynamics change owing to a rise in fuel prices, an increase in renewable penetration, a change in operational policies, etc. While the dip in model accuracy for unseen data is a cause for concern, what is more, challenging is not knowing when the ML model would respond in such a manner. Such uncertainty makes the power market participants, like bidding agents and retailers, vulnerable to substantial financial loss caused by the prediction errors of EPF models. Therefore, it becomes essential to identify whether or not the model prediction at a given instance is trustworthy. In this light, this paper proposes a trust algorithm for EPF users based on explainable artificial intelligence techniques. The suggested algorithm generates trust scores that reflect the model's prediction quality for each new input. These scores are formulated in two stages: in the first stage, the coarse version of the score is formed using correlations of local and global explanations, and in the second stage, the score is fine-tuned further by the Shapley additive explanations values of different features. Such score-based explanations are more straightforward than feature-based visual explanations for EPF users like asset managers and traders. A dataset from Italy's and ERCOT's electricity market validates the efficacy of the proposed algorithm. Results show that the algorithm has more than 85% accuracy in identifying good predictions when the data distribution is similar to the training dataset. In the case of distribution shift, the algorithm shows the same accuracy level in identifying bad predictions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In the field of Explainable AI, multiples evaluation metrics have been proposed in order to assess the quality of explanation methods w.r.t. a set of desired properties. In this work, we study the articulation between the stability, correctness and plausibility of explanations based on feature importance for image classifiers. We show that the existing metrics for evaluating these properties do not always agree, raising the issue of what constitutes a good evaluation metric for explanations. Finally, in the particular case of stability and correctness, we show the possible limitations of some evaluation metrics and propose new ones that take into account the local behaviour of the model under test. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of our research is the enhancement of decision support methods grounded in statistical quality control. In our study we combine machine learning classifiers, and explanatory algorithms (XAI) with the Six Sigma practice to automate the evaluation of quality of steel products and determine origins of their defects. We use knowledge transfer to expand the available set of quality information in order to create explanations that are easier to interpret, especially without detailed knowledge of the data. We describe our original method, and provide evaluation of the results with real-life data from our industrial partner. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding the causes of traffic road accidents is crucial; however, as data collection is conducted by traffic police, accident-related environmental information is not available. To fill this gap, we collect information on the built environment within R = 500 m of the accident site; model the factors influencing accident severity in Shenyang, China, from 2018 to 2020 using the Random Forest algorithm; and use the SHapley Additive exPlanation method to interpret the underlying driving forces. We initially integrate five indicators of the built environment with 18 characteristics, including human and vehicle at-fault characters, infrastructure, time, climate, and land use attributes. Our results show that road type, urban/rural, season, and speed limit in the first 10 factors have a significant positive effect on accident severity; density of commercial-POI in the first 10 factors has a significant negative effect. Factors such as urban/rural and road type, commercial and vehicle type, road type, and season have significant effects on accident severity through an interactive mechanism. These findings provide important information for improving road safety. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Impact echo (IE) is one of the most frequently used nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques for detecting subsurface defects such as delamination, honeycombing, and voids in concrete structures. In the conventional analysis of IE data, the time-domain signal is transformed into the frequency domain and the frequency content is used to estimate the presence and nature of the defect. Machine learning (ML) has been recently applied to the IE signal classification problem. However, because of the scarcity of labeled IE datasets, most existing work relies on relatively small training and test datasets without addressing the generalizability and transferability of the developed models. In this paper, we compare two approaches for automatic classification of IE signals: clustering based on expert-crafted features and deep learning (DL) from automatically extracted features. Next, we use the knowledge gained from a DL model trained on concrete specimens with available ground truth to make predictions about defects in a different specimen with completely different construction and characteristics (transfer learning). Finally, we examine our DL model to gain insights into the model working (explainability) and highlight the attributions that are significant in classifying a particular IE signal. Our findings demonstrate the utility of ML and DL for IE signal classification, but also highlight the need for high-quality labeled datasets for advancing ML and DL in NDE data analysis. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Although shared e-scooters have displayed both complementary and competitive relationships with public transport, less attention has been paid to investigating the spatiotemporal variations of such relationships, and how the relationships are associated with the urban built environment. To bridge the gaps, we first explore the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of such relationships by conducting a comparative study of Stockholm and Helsinki based on the empirical data. Then, an explainable AI method is applied to examine the associations between the relationships and built environment. We found that Helsinki presents higher ratios of the competitive dominant areas (D<inf>PET</inf>) compared with Stockholm showing higher ratios of the complementary dominant areas (D<inf>PLE</inf>). The correlation analysis results indicate that the distance-to-public-transport is associated with D<inf>PET</inf> in two cities. Some factors present a non-linear effect, e.g., the density-of-the-population, etc. This study is beneficial for the better integration of shared e-scooters and public transport towards sustainable urban mobility systems. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Accurate estimation of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) is crucial for improving the water use efficiency and designing and operating irrigation systems. To accurately calculate winter wheat ETc with limited meteorological data, the present study proposed two interpretable machine learning (ML) models (random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)) as well as non-interpretable ML models (support vector machine (SVM) and deep neural network (DNN)) based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm using observed winter wheat ETc data during the period from 2007 to 2013 at Luan Cheng Agro-ecosystem Experimental Station. Mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), coefficient of determination (R2), and global performance indicator (GPI) were used to assess the performance of models. This demonstrated that the ML models based on the crop coefficient (Kc) and solar radiation (Rn) were accurate and offered a workaround for calculating winter wheat ETc in the absence of meteorological data. In four ML models, the ninth input combination, consisting of Kc, Rn, daily air maximum temperature (Tmax), daily air minimum temperature (Tmin), sunshine hours (n), and wind speed with a height of 2 m (U<inf>2</inf>), produced the best estimate of ETc. Among them, the PSO-based SVM (PSO-SVM) model obtained the best results for estimating ETc with MAE, RMSE, NSE, R2, and GPI values of 0.389 mm·d−1, 0.562 mm·d−1 0.910, 0.911, and 0.975, respectively, showing the advantages of the non-interpretable ML model in ETc forecasting. Accurate descriptions of actual hydrological and climatic processes were given by local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME). The inflection points of daily climatic parameters (Tmin, Tmax, Rn, n) related to ETc were determined to be 3.80 °C, 5.50 °C, 1.62 MJ·m−2·d−1, 1.37 h, respectively. This work has potential to overcome the difficulty of measuring winter wheat ETc properly due to the lack of meteorological data and accomplish appropriate water management to conserve water and increase water productivity. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The number of expressway road accidents in Sri Lanka has significantly increased (by 20%) due to the expansion of the transport network and high traffic volume. It is crucial to identify the causes of these crashes for effective road safety management. However, traditional statistical methods may be insufficient due to their inherent assumptions. This study utilized explainable machine learning to investigate the factors that affect the severity of traffic crashes on expressways. The study evaluated two groups of traffic crashes: fatal or severe crashes, and other crashes that included non-severe injuries or only property damage. Five factors that contribute to crashes were analyzed: road surface condition, road alignment, location, weather condition, and lighting effect. Four machine learning models (Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)) were developed and compared with Logistic Regression (LR) using 223 training and 56 testing data instances. The study revealed that the machine learning algorithms provided more accurate predictions than the LR model. To explain the machine learning models, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) were used. These methods revealed that all five features decreased the possibility of occurrence of fatal accidents. SHAP and LIME explanations confirmed the known interactions between factors influencing crash severity in expressway operational conditions. These explanations increase the trust of end-users and domain experts on machine learning models. Furthermore, the study concluded that using explainable machine learning methods is more effective than traditional regression analysis in evaluating safety performance. Additionally, the results of the study can be utilized to improve road safety by providing accurate explanations for decision-making processes for black-box models. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A public-private partnership (PPP) is a common procurement model implemented worldwide as a catalyst for economic growth and improved public infrastructure. However, due to their inherent characteristics, the risk of failure in some PPP projects is high, causing heavy losses to both entities. Despite distinctive progress being made in PPP projects to reduce their failure probability, there is no proper and effective framework to predict PPP project failure in advance in either developing or in developed countries. The present study aims to develop a machine learning (ML) model to predict the failure of PPP projects to prosper in adverse conditions. This research addresses two critical issues, i.e., class imbalance and interpretability of ML models, that differentiate the current study from data-driven studies to date. First, existing studies usually focused on comparing and selecting the most adequate ML methods, but this study distinctively compared the performances of nine data resampling algorithms. Besides, in order to enhance the interpretability and visibility of the proposed model, a game theory-based feature investigation algorithm, Shapley additive explanations (SHAP), was used to identify not only the most significant features, but also the conditions of the features that cause failure or success in PPP projects. The findings illustrate that the proposed model yielded the highest prediction performance once the data set was resampled with the support vector machine-synthetic minority oversampling technique (SVM-SMOTE). SHAP analysis further shows that unsolicited proposals, domestic credit to the private sector, and project type/subtype have significant impacts on the prediction rationale. Overall, this study contributes to theory through incorporating resampling methods and SHAP algorithm into ML models as well as to practice with an advanced and reliable model to predict the status of PPP projects. The data-driven model and findings are expected to respond to current policy and industry needs by proposing a robust decision-making input for detecting risky PPP projects, allocating resources more effectively based on the most critical failure factors, and promoting the transparency of PPP project outcomes. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - To reveal the built environmental factors that significantly affect the spatial fairness of conventional transit and their effective ranges, a spatial fairness measurement model (spatial exclusion index model) for conventional transit at the scale of traffic analysis zone is established. Using conventional transit network data and urban POI data, the built environment 3D (density, distance, diversity) factors and the transit spatial exclusion index based on reachability of 949 traffic analysis areas in 5 main urban districts of Kunming are calculated by using Voronoi diagram, network analysis and other methods. The complex relationship between built environment factors and the spatial fairness of conventional transit is fitted by using gradient lifting tree (GBDT) model, and the result is compared with the result of multiple regression model. The influence of built environmental factors on the spatial fairness of conventional transit is revealed based on the variable importance method and partial dependence graph. The result shows that (1) SEI model can reflect the traffic fairness of each traffic analysis area, and can identify the disadvantage range of traffic reachability in the study area; (2) compared with the classical linear regression model, the nonlinear GBDT model has a higher goodness of fit and explanatory power; (3) there is a complex nonlinear relationship between the built environment and the transit spatial exclusion index, and the built environment shows an obvious threshold effect in the process of affecting the spatial fairness of conventional transit; (4) the influences of “distance” (44. 01%) and “density” (43. 89%) are greater than that of the “diversity” (12. 08%), and administration center proximity (31. 57%), residential density (18. 98%) and transit stop density (13. 85%) are the key factors that affect traffic fairness at the level of built environment. The research result can provide reference for the formulation of traffic fairness improvement strategy based on land use and spatial planning. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In the context of global warming, tropical cyclones (TCs) have garnered significant attention as one of the most severe natural disasters in China, particularly in terms of assessing the disaster losses. This study aims to evaluate the TC disaster loss (TCDL) using machine learning (ML) algorithms and identify the impact of specific feature factors on the prediction of model with an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) approach, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). The results show that LightGBM outperforms Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes (NB) for estimating the TCDL grades, achieving the highest accuracy value of 0.86. According to the SHAP values, the three most important factors in the LightGBM classifier model are proportion of stations with rainfall exceeding 50 mm (ProRain), maximum wind speed (MaxWind), and maximum daily rainfall (MaxRain). Specifically, in the estimation of high TCDL grade, events characterized with MaxWind exceeding 30 m/s, MaxRain exceeding 200 mm, and ProRain exceeding 30% tend to exhibit a higher susceptibility to TC disaster due to positive SHAP values. This study offers a valuable tool for decision-makers to develop scientific strategies in the risk management of TC disaster. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In the context of globalization in the mining industry, assessing the production feasibility of mining projects by smart technology is crucial for the improvement of mining development efficiency. However, evaluating the feasibility of such projects faces significant challenges due to incomplete data and complex variables. In recent years, the development of big data technology has offered new possibilities for rapidly evaluating mining projects. This study conducts an intelligent evaluation of gold mines based on global mineral resources data to estimate whether a gold mine project can be put into production. A technical workflow is constructed, including data filling, evaluation model construction, and production feasibility evaluation. Based on the workflow, the missing data is filled in by the Miceforest imputation algorithm first. The evaluation model is established based on the Random Forest model to quantitatively predict the feasibility of the mining project being put into production, and important features of the model are extracted using Shapley Additive explanation(SHAP). This workflow may enhance the efficiency and accuracy of quantitative production feasibility evaluation for mining projects, with an accuracy rate increased from 93.80% to 95.99%. Results suggest that the features of estimated mine life and gold ore grade have the most significant impact on production feasibility. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Corrosion of reinforcement can lead to a decrease in the load carrying capacity of reinforced concrete structures and affect their safety. Therefore, accurate evaluation of the ultimate load carrying capacity is crucial for the maintenance and reinforcement of corroded reinforced concrete structures. In this paper, based on experimental research data of 192 corroded reinforced concrete compression bending members, data-driven analysis was conducted using ANN, SVM, RF, and AdaBoost algorithms to establish the relationship between the influencing factors of the load carrying capacity and their ultimate load carrying capacity. The input variables include the section width of the member, section height of the member, length of member, yield strength of reinforcement, diameter of longitudinal reinforcement, compressive strength of concrete, thickness of concrete cover, hoop diameter, original eccentricity, corrosion rate and the ultimate load carrying capacity is the output variable. Additionally, this study innovatively utilizes the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) method to enhance the interpretability of the ML models, overcoming the “black box” issue associated with ML methods. Furthermore, the performance of the ML models is compared with theoretical formulas. The results indicate that the ML models exhibit good predictive performance, with higher accuracy than thetheoretical calculation formulas. And the predictive performance of ensemble learning models (RF, AdaBoost) is better than that of single learning models (ANN, SVM). The newly developed hybrid ML model is likely to become a new choice for dealing with the load carrying capacity problem of corroded reinforced concrete compression bending members. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A design exploration of hexachiral structures using explainable machine learning (ML) is performed in this work. The hexachiral structures are fabricated using resin via vat photopolymerization (VPP). The ML model is used to build the function that explains the association between Poisson's ratio and the hexachiral design parameters. The data set for ML model construction is first collected by using the Halton sequence and simulated using the finite element method (FEM). To validate the data set, the results obtained from the FEM simulation are compared with those obtained from the compression test. The Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) models for Poisson's ratio and porosity are constructed to extract important design insight. A Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) are used to analyze the sensitivity of the porosity and Poisson's ratio to the hexachiral design parameters. GSA result shows that the strut's thickness is the most decisive parameter that affects the Poisson's ratio. The application of SHAP also reveals that the relationship between the strut thickness and Poisson's ratio is nonlinear. Finally, the minimum Poisson's ratio value is achieved by design with minimum strut thickness, minimum node radius, and maximum strut length. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) are both branches of AI. As a form of AI, ML automatically adapts to changing datasets with minimal human interference. Deep learning is a subset of ML that uses artificial neural networks to imitate the learning process of the human brain. The ‘black box’ nature of ML and DL makes their inner workings difficult to understand and interpret. Deploying explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) can help explain why and how the output of ML and DL models are generated. As a result, understanding a model's functioning, behavior, and outputs can be garnered, reducing bias and error and improving confidence in decision-making. Despite providing an improved understanding of model outputs, XAI has received limited attention in construction. This paper presents a narrative review of XAI and a taxonomy of precepts and models to raise awareness about its potential opportunities for use in construction. It is envisaged that the opportunities suggested can stimulate new lines of inquiry to help alleviate the prevailing skepticism and hesitancy toward AI adoption and integration in construction. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Due to knowledge alienation, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in tunnel construction has been greatly stunted in recent years. In order to motivate the development of techniques in tunneling works, we propose an approach that combines automated machine learning, explainable AI, and building information modeling in this paper. Considering geotechnical uncertainties from soil properties and aleatoric uncertainties from the predicting model, this approach is used to evaluate the system risk during a large-diameter tunnel excavation taking into account the two sources of uncertainties simultaneously. The geotechnical uncertainties are evaluated by the confidence interval of the mean of samples in the Monte-Carlo simulation, and the aleatoric uncertainties are evaluated by computing the prediction interval of the machine learning models. It is found that the number of Monte-Carlo samples significantly affects the evaluation of the system's reliability. Based on our results, a generalized setup with 1000 samples performs the best and is recommended considering the efficiency of computation, as well as the reliability and conservativeness of the result. This paper effectively assists with system reliability evaluation in large-diameter tunnel constructions, where the interactive and explainable AI approach largely motivates the application of AI techniques in the field of tunnel construction. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this study is to apply and characterize eXplainable AI (XAI) to assess the quality of synthetic health data generated using a data augmentation algorithm. In this exploratory study, several synthetic datasets are generated using various configurations of a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) from a set of 156 observations related to adult hearing screening. A rule-based native XAI algorithm, the Logic Learning Machine, is used in combination with conventional utility metrics. The classification performance in different conditions is assessed: models trained and tested on synthetic data, models trained on synthetic data and tested on real data, and models trained on real data and tested on synthetic data. The rules extracted from real and synthetic data are then compared using a rule similarity metric. The results indicate that XAI may be used to assess the quality of synthetic data by (i) the analysis of classification performance and (ii) the analysis of the rules extracted on real and synthetic data (number, covering, structure, cut-off values, and similarity). These results suggest that XAI can be used in an original way to assess synthetic health data and extract knowledge about the mechanisms underlying the generated data. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The transformation of industrial environments is progressing at a fast pace as more and more autonomous systems are installed and operated. Save and explainable AI algorithms are thus essential, especially for collaborative interactive systems that operate in human spaces. We propose the "Semantic Encoder", a 2D-vision based CNN model trained on a purely synthetic dataset, to address the explainability aspect by extracting semantic descriptions of real objects based on their visual appearances. We can use the extracted semantic information to simply describe depicted samples or to differentiate between normal and anomalous samples, with the possibility to explain what caused the anomaly detection. The semantic description can be further used to sort samples by classifying them or to find a sample with specific semantic properties. We evaluate the Semantic Encoder with respect to its informative power by comparing the computed semantic features with features extracted by a VGG-16 model and classical image processing methods. The results are quantified based on the Generalized Discriminative Value (GDV). We also investigate how accurately anomalous samples are detected by computing ROC and PR curves. We use the semantic parameters to understand what causes good and inaccurate anomaly detection decisions. In addition, we evaluate the quality of the classification based sorting by examining confusion matrices and classification accuracy. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - To keep up with shifting technology trends and remain competitive, more manufacturing companies are investigating how to utilize data analytics to improve their processes. An issue these companies often face today is the need for more competence to perform advanced analytics projects within their departments. By using a human-in-the-loop approach and efficiently utilizing current domain knowledge in combination with data analytics, the higher success of implementation can be achieved. A common approach today to perform data analytics projects is to use the general Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) methodology. This methodology does not consider the challenges specific to manufacturing and how to include domain expertise. This paper, therefore, suggests how the CRISP-DM methodology can be adapted to compensate for these issues. The adapted methodology is demonstrated in a case study for improving quality in the machining process by using interpretable machine learning models that can be used to assist experts when performing root cause analysis. This contributes to showing how to use domain experts' knowledge better and how data analytics can be used in conjunction with domain-specific methods. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Fluorescence staining techniques, such as Cell Painting, together with fluorescence microscopy have proven invaluable for visualizing and quantifying the effects that drugs and other perturbations have on cultured cells. However, fluorescence microscopy is expensive, time-consuming, labor-intensive, and the stains applied can be cytotoxic, interfering with the activity under study. The simplest form of microscopy, brightfield microscopy, lacks these downsides, but the images produced have low contrast and the cellular compartments are difficult to discern. Nevertheless, by harnessing deep learning, these brightfield images may still be sufficient for various predictive purposes. In this study, we compared the predictive performance of models trained on fluorescence images to those trained on brightfield images for predicting the mechanism of action (MoA) of different drugs. We also extracted CellProfiler features from the fluorescence images and used them to benchmark the performance. Overall, we found comparable and largely correlated predictive performance for the two imaging modalities. This is promising for future studies of MoAs in time-lapse experiments for which using fluorescence images is problematic. Explorations based on explainable AI techniques also provided valuable insights regarding compounds that were better predicted by one modality over the other. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, and the identification of biomarkers can improve early detection and personalized treatment. In this study, RNA-seq data and gene chip data from TCGA and GEO were used to explore potential biomarkers for CRC. The SMOTE method was used to address class imbalance, and four feature selection algorithms (MCFS, Borota, mRMR, and LightGBM) were used to select genes from the gene expression matrix. Four machine learning algorithms (SVM, XGBoost, RF, and kNN) were then employed to obtain the optimal number of genes for model construction. Through interpretable machine learning (IML), co-predictive networks were generated to identify rules and uncover underlying relationships among the selected genes. Survival analysis revealed that INHBA, FNBP1, PDE9A, HIST1H2BG, and CADM3 were significantly correlated with prognosis in CRC patients. In addition, the CIBERSORT algorithm was used to investigate the proportion of immune cells in CRC tissues, and gene mutation rates for the five selected biomarkers were explored. The biomarkers identified in this study have significant implications for the development of personalized therapies and could ultimately lead to improved clinical outcomes for CRC patients. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Hyperbox-based machine learning algorithms are an important and popular branch of machine learning in the construction of classifiers using fuzzy sets and logic theory and neural network architectures. This type of learning is characterised by many strong points of modern predictors such as a high scalability, explainability, online adaptation, effective learning from a small amount of data, native ability to deal with missing data and accommodating new classes. Nevertheless, there is no comprehensive existing package for hyperbox-based machine learning which can serve as a benchmark for research and allow non-expert users to apply these algorithms easily. The hyperbox-brain is an open-source Python library implementing the leading hyperbox-based machine learning algorithms. This library exposes a unified API which closely follows and is compatible with the renowned scikit-learn and numpy toolboxes. The library may be installed from Python Package Index (PyPI) and the conda package manager and is distributed under the GPL-3 license. The source code, documentation, detailed tutorials, and the full descriptions of the API are available at https://uts-caslab.github.io/hyperbox-brain. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Tabular datasets, collections of rows and columns, are fundamental in data analysis in basically all areas of research. Self-report questionnaires are a very common and useful tool for gathering data from users, patients, or customers. Often, experts can label each item of these questionnaires as a measure of a given condition or behavior, e.g., mental health conditions such as depression. Considering this, many artificial intelligence techniques, particularly those related to machine learning, have been proposed to analyze the data provided by these tools. However, self-report questionnaires can be very extensive, which often affects the quality of the responses, complicates the data analysis, and renders them more time-consuming. In this paper, the software IREX is presented. IREX iteratively refines tabular datasets, such as self-report questionnaires, while providing an explanation of a given classification model. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The main reason for agricultural productivity decline is farmers' failure to choose the appropriate crop for their soil. It is important for farmers to understand which crops are suitable for different soil types based on their characteristics. Due to the vast variety of soil types worldwide, farmers often struggle to choose the most profitable crop for their land. To improve crop yields, a crop selection system has been developed using GBRT-based deep learning surrogate models. Gradient Boosted Regression Tree (GBRT) has been combined with a Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm to determine the most optimal hyperparameters for the deep neural network. The optimized hyperparameters are then applied during the testing phase. Further, the impact of each input parameter on the individual outputs is evaluated using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). The crop recommendation system comprises data preparation, classification, and performance evaluation modules. A classification method based on confusion matrices and performance matrices, as well as feature analysis using density plots and correlation plots, follows. The crop selection system categorizes the experimental dataset into 12 classes, with three for each of the four crops. The dataset includes soil-specific physical and chemical features such as sand, silt, clay, pH, electric conductivity (EC), soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). The developed surrogate model is highly accurate, precise, and reliable, with an F1-Score of 1.0 for all classes in the dataset, indicating exact accuracy and recall. The DNN-based classification model achieves an average classification accuracy of 1.00. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Prolonged exposure to freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) induces adverse effects in concrete structures in terms of a significant reduction in strength and durability. This paper proposes a microencapsulated phase change material-incorporated concrete (MPCMC) layer to mitigate FTCs in the concrete bridge decks. Toward this, the present work implements finite element analysis (FEA)-based multiscale numerical simulation, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed MPCMC protective layer toward FTC reduction. Moreover, the multiscale framework is leveraged to generate a large dataset containing 8096 data points of FTCs considering a uniform variation of five design parameters, namely the thickness of the protective MPCMC layer, volume fraction, transition temperature, size, and the latent heat of the MPCM. Thereafter, the dataset is leveraged to develop an interpretable neural network (NN)-based predictive model as a computationally efficient alternative to the complex multiscale FEA-based design tools. The interpretable machine learning (ML) model provides a reliable and efficient continuous mapping between the design parameter space and the resultant number of FTCs. Moreover, it explains general engineering intuitions and physics. Besides, the interpretable ML characterizes various underlying interplays of the design parameters in dictating the resultant FTCs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The challenge of the research work presented in the paper is to combine the growing interest in monitoring the health condition of existing bridge heritage through systematic and periodic visual inspections with automated recognition of typical bridge defects, which can greatly facilitate the assessment of defect evolution over time. The study focused on the automated identification of defects in existing Reinforced Concrete (RC) bridges exploiting different Deep Learning (DL) approaches and techniques to interpret the obtained predictions. Ensuring the safety of infrastructures is typically a technical and economic issue. Still, in the case of the engineering infrastructure heritage, there are existing bridges and viaducts with a high historical, cultural, and symbolic value. For them, accurate knowledge and characterization of possible degradation processes become particularly important in order to define intervention strategies that combine safety and conservation requirements. With the aim to develop systematic and non-invasive investigation protocols for continuous and effective control of defects and their evolution, a database of existing RC bridge defect images was collected, and the most recurrent defect typologies were classified by domain experts. Some existing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) algorithms were applied to the dataset for automatically recognizing all defects, but the specific novel contribution of the research work is the interpretation of the obtained results in a form that is humanly explainable and directly implementable in new tools for bridge inspections. To interpret the results, Class Activation Maps (CAMs) approaches were employed within available eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, which allow to observe the activation zones and nearly perfectly highlight the type of specific defect in a given image. The obtained results, besides suggesting which network works better than others and if the specific defect is effectively recognized, have been evaluated through a quasi-quantitative procedure that compared a qualitative assessment of the CNNs models reliability with two novel indexes representing new explaining metrics of the obtained results. In the end, the outcomes of the proposed study were observed also in a real-life case study. The proposed discussion opens new scenarios in the application of these techniques for supporting road management companies and public organizations in the evaluation of the road networks health state. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Knowledge graphs are important in human-centered AI because of their ability to reduce the need for large labelled machine-learning datasets, facilitate transfer learning, and generate explanations. However, knowledge-graph construction has evolved into a complex, semi-automatic process that increasingly relies on opaque deep-learning models and vast collections of heterogeneous data sources to scale. The knowledge-graph lifecycle is not transparent, accountability is limited, and there are no accounts of, or indeed methods to determine, how fair a knowledge graph is in the downstream applications that use it. Knowledge graphs are thus at odds with AI regulation, for instance the EU's upcoming AI Act, and with ongoing efforts elsewhere in AI to audit and debias data and algorithms. This paper reports on work in progress towards designing explainable (XAI) knowledge-graph construction pipelines with human-in-the-loop and discusses research topics in this space. These were grounded in a systematic literature review, in which we studied tasks in knowledge-graph construction that are often automated, as well as common methods to explain how they work and their outcomes. We identified three directions for future research: (i) tasks in knowledge-graph construction where manual input remains essential and where there may be opportunities for AI assistance; (ii) integrating XAI methods into established knowledge-engineering practices to improve stakeholder experience; as well as (iii) evaluating how effective explanations genuinely are in making knowledge-graph construction more trustworthy. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A stable supply of electrical energy is essential for the functioning of our society. Therefore, energy and balancing markets of power grids are strictly regulated. With changes in technology, the economy and society, these regulations are also constantly adapted. However, whether these regulatory changes lead to the intended results is not easy to assess. Could eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) models distinguish regulatory settings and support the understanding of the effects of these changes? In this article, we explore two examples of regulatory changes: The splitting of the German-Austrian bidding zone and changes in the pricing schemes of the German balancing energy market. We find that boosted tree models and feedforward neural networks before and after a regulatory change differ in their respective parametrizations. Using Shapley additive explanations, we reveal model differences, e.g., in terms of feature importance, and identify key features of these distinct models. With this study, we demonstrate how XAI can be applied to investigate system changes in power systems. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Public attention towards explainability of artificial intelligence (AI) systems has been rising in recent years to offer methodologies for human oversight. This has translated into the proliferation of research outputs, such as from Explainable AI, to enhance transparency and control for system debugging and monitoring, and intelligibility of system process and output for user services. Yet, such outputs are difficult to adopt on a practical level due to a lack of a common regulatory baseline, and the contextual nature of explanations. Governmental policies are now attempting to tackle such exigence, however it remains unclear to what extent published communications, regulations, and standards adopt an informed perspective to support research, industry, and civil interests. In this study, we perform the first thematic and gap analysis of this plethora of policies and standards on explainability in the EU, US, and UK. Through a rigorous survey of policy documents, we first contribute an overview of governmental regulatory trajectories within AI explainability and its sociotechnical impacts. We find that policies are often informed by coarse notions and requirements for explanations. This might be due to the willingness to conciliate explanations foremost as a risk management tool for AI oversight, but also due to the lack of a consensus on what constitutes a valid algorithmic explanation, and how feasible the implementation and deployment of such explanations are across stakeholders of an organization. Informed by AI explainability research, we then conduct a gap analysis of existing policies, which leads us to formulate a set of recommendations on how to address explainability in regulations for AI systems, especially discussing the definition, feasibility, and usability of explanations, as well as allocating accountability to explanation providers. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Maintaining and rehabilitating pavement in a timely manner is essential for preserving or improving its condition, with roughness being a critical factor. Accurate prediction of road roughness is a vital component of sustainable transportation because it helps transportation planners to develop cost-effective and sustainable pavement maintenance and rehabilitation strategies. Traditional statistical methods can be less effective for this purpose due to their inherent assumptions, rendering them inaccurate. Therefore, this study employed explainable and supervised machine learning algorithms to predict the International Roughness Index (IRI) of asphalt concrete pavement in Sri Lankan arterial roads from 2013 to 2018. Two predictor variables, pavement age and cumulative traffic volume, were used in this study. Five machine learning models, namely Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), XGBoost (XGB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), were utilized and compared with the statistical model. The study findings revealed that the machine learning algorithms’ predictions were superior to those of the regression model, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of more than 0.75, except for SVM. Moreover, RF provided the best prediction among the five machine learning algorithms due to its extrapolation and global optimization capabilities. Further, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis showed that both explanatory variables had positive impacts on IRI progression, with pavement age having the most significant effect. Providing accurate explanations for the decision-making processes in black box models using SHAP analysis increases the trust of road users and domain experts in the predictions generated by machine learning models. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that the use of explainable AI-based methods was more effective than traditional regression analysis in IRI prediction. Overall, using this approach, road authorities can plan for timely maintenance to avoid costly and extensive rehabilitation. Therefore, sustainable transportation can be promoted by extending pavement life and reducing frequent reconstruction. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Project control is a crucial phase within project management aimed at ensuring —in an integrated manner— that the project objectives are met according to plan. Earned Value Management —along with its various refinements— is the most popular and widespread method for top-down project control. For project control under uncertainty, Monte Carlo simulation and statistical/machine learning models extend the earned value framework by allowing the analysis of deviations, expected times and costs during project progress. Recent advances in explainable machine learning, in particular attribution methods based on Shapley values, can be used to link project control to activity properties, facilitating the interpretation of interrelations between activity characteristics and control objectives. This work proposes a new methodology that adds an explainability layer based on SHAP —Shapley Additive exPlanations— to different machine learning models fitted to Monte Carlo simulations of the project network during tracking control points. Specifically, our method allows for both prospective and retrospective analyses, which have different utilities: forward analysis helps to identify key relationships between the different tasks and the desired outcomes, thus being useful to make execution/replanning decisions; and backward analysis serves to identify the causes of project status during project progress. Furthermore, this method is general, model-agnostic and provides quantifiable and easily interpretable information, hence constituting a valuable tool for project control in uncertain environments. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - There are many intertwined factors such as urban fabric, vegetation combination, and meteorological conditions that influence the spatial distribution of fine particles (PM<inf>2.5</inf>, aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm) in near-road urban areas, and it is difficult yet important to disentangle them. Identifying the relative importance of those factors could facilitate designing urban fabric and roadside vegetation combination patterns to mitigate the negative impacts of particles. This study first proposes an effective and reliable integrated method of the ENVI-met microclimate model and interpretable machine learning to quantify the multifactorial effects. Data from ENVI-met models with different built environments and meteorological conditions are used to train and test the machine learning (ML) models. All ML models show high accuracy in predicting PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentrations with R2 high than 0.87. Results indicate that height level and study area are the two most important features, explaining 22.8% and 20.4% of the variation in PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentration, respectively. The feature pairwise interactions account for 45.8% of ambient particle concentrations. The combination of trees and hedges in urban fabrics with longer building length than width could mitigate PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentrations in residential areas. The integrated methods in this study could be extrapolated to future research to perform source identification analysis. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Robust optimization is an ideal solution for enhancing safety in tunnel construction in the presence of unpredictable soil conditions, especially in large-diameter tunnel construction, since it requires the least amount of information about uncertainties. However, the application of robust optimization to real-world projects is greatly hampered by its dependence on mathematical models. To address this issue, this study builds a pipeline machine learning model to forecast tunnel-induced damage that can be addressed using the robust optimization (RO) algorithm with high accuracy. The optimization process is integrated into a building information modeling (BIM) platform and analyzed using the Shapley Additive ExPlanations (SHAP) technique, allowing the designer to understand and interact with the algorithm. The average improvement of testing samples using an ellipsoidal uncertainty set with a size of 0.05 is 23.8 and 4.9% on the two selected criteria, which is more conservative than using deterministic optimization (DO) and stochastic optimization (SO). This study establishes an interactive and explainable optimization platform that enables designers to make judgments under the most unfavorable soil conditions with the least amount of accessible information about the uncertainties during tunneling. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Nowadays Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a fundamental component of healthcare applications, both clinical and remote, but the best performing AI systems are often too complex to be self-explaining. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques are defined to unveil the reasoning behind the system’s predictions and decisions, and they become even more critical when dealing with sensitive and personal health data. It is worth noting that XAI has not gathered the same attention across different research areas and data types, especially in healthcare. In particular, many clinical and remote health applications are based on tabular and time series data, respectively, and XAI is not commonly analysed on these data types, while computer vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) are the reference applications. To provide an overview of XAI methods that are most suitable for tabular and time series data in the healthcare domain, this paper provides a review of the literature in the last 5 years, illustrating the type of generated explanations and the efforts provided to evaluate their relevance and quality. Specifically, we identify clinical validation, consistency assessment, objective and standardised quality evaluation, and human-centered quality assessment as key features to ensure effective explanations for the end users. Finally, we highlight the main research challenges in the field as well as the limitations of existing XAI methods. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In response to socioeconomic development, the number of machine learning applications has increased, along with the calls for algorithmic transparency and further sustainability in terms of energy efficient technologies. Modern computer algorithms that process large amounts of information, particularly artificial intelligence methods and their workhorse machine learning, can be used to promote and support sustainability; however, they consume a lot of energy themselves. This work focuses and interconnects two key aspects of artificial intelligence regarding the transparency and sustainability of model development. We identify frameworks for measuring carbon emissions from Python algorithms and evaluate energy consumption during model development. Additionally, we test the impact of explainability on algorithmic energy consumption during model optimization, particularly for applications in health and, to expand the scope and achieve a widespread use, civil engineering and computer vision. Specifically, we present three different models of classification, regression and object-based detection for the scenarios of cancer classification, building energy, and image detection, each integrated with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) or feature reduction. This work can serve as a guide for selecting a tool to measure and scrutinize algorithmic energy consumption and raise awareness of emission-based model optimization by highlighting the sustainability of XAI. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Video surveillance and image acquisition systems represent one of the most active research topics in computer vision and smart city domains. The growing concern for public and workers’ safety has led to a significant increase in the use of surveillance cameras that provide high-definition images and even depth maps when 3D cameras are available. Consequently, the need for automatic techniques for behavior analysis and action recognition is also increasing for several applications such as dangerous actions detection in railway stations or construction sites, event detection in crowd videos, behavior analysis, optimization in industrial sites, etc. In this context, several computer vision and deep learning solutions have been proposed recently where deep neural networks provided more accurate solutions, but they are not so efficient in terms of explainability and flexibility since they remain adapted for specific situations only. Moreover, the complexity of deep neural architectures requires the use of high computing resources to provide fast and real-time computations. In this paper, we propose a review and a comparative analysis of deep learning solutions in terms of precision, explainability, computation time, memory size, and flexibility. Experimental results are conducted within simulated and real-world dangerous actions in railway construction sites. Thanks to our comparative analysis and evaluation, we propose a personalized approach for dangerous action recognition depending on the type of collected data (image) and users’ requirements. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Identifying suspects from surveillance footage is a crucial task in forensic investigations, but it is often hindered by the variable conditions of observation and the large amounts of data. Face image quality (FIQ) is a metric that measures the usefulness of a face sample for facial recognition. Existing methods for automated FIQ assessment only provide a scalar value for quality, and do not indicate which factors are causing low quality. Additionally, these methods are computationally expensive, which makes current FIQ assessment methods unsuitable for large numbers of images. To address these issues, we introduce multi-task explainable quality networks (XQNets). XQNets provide both the quality value and the associated facial and environmental attributes, and automatically learn how each attribute contributes to the quality value during the training process. We also propose a dataset-agnostic quality pairing protocol to ensure that sample pairs are balanced across datasets and evaluations are fair. Our experiments on the LFW and SCface benchmarks show that our approach generalizes well across different datasets and outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our method offers a fast, explainable approach to FIQ assessment, making it suitable for large-scale forensic applications. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Identifying the fraud risk of applications on the web platform is a critical challenge with both requirements of effectiveness and interpretability. In these high-stakes web applications especially in financial scenarios, decision rules have been extensively used due to the rising requirements for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). In this work, we develop a rule learning framework with rule mining and rule refining modules for addressing the learning efficiency and class imbalance issues while making the decision rules more broadly and simply applicable to risk management scenarios. On four benchmark data-sets and two large-scale data-sets, the classification performance, interpretability, and scalability of the framework have been proved, achieving at least a 26.2% relative improvement over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. The system is currently being used by hundreds of millions of users and dealing with an enormous number of transactions in Ant Group, which is one of the largest mobile payment platforms in the world. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Good explanations help people understand hateful memes and mitigate sharing. While AI-enabled automatic detection has proliferated, we argue that quality-controlled crowdsourcing can be an effective strategy to offer good explanations for hateful memes. This paper proposes a Generate-Annotate-Revise workflow to crowdsource explanations and presents the results from two user studies. Study 1 evaluated the objective quality of the explanation with three measurements: detailedness, completeness, and accuracy, and suggested that the proposed workflow generated higher quality explanations than the ones from a single-stage workflow without quality control. Study 2 used an online experiment to examine how different explanations affect users' perception. The results from 127 participants demonstrated that people without prior cultural knowledge gained significant perceived understanding and awareness of hateful memes when presented with explanations generated by the proposed multi-stage workflow as opposed to single-stage or machine-generated explanations. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Predictive Process Analytics is becoming an essential aid for organizations, providing online operational support of their processes. However, process stakeholders need to be provided with an explanation of the reasons why a given process execution is predicted to behave in a certain way. Otherwise, they will be unlikely to trust the predictive monitoring technology and, hence, adopt it. This paper proposes a predictive analytics framework that is also equipped with explanation capabilities based on the game theory of Shapley Values. The framework has been implemented in the IBM Process Mining suite and commercialized for business users. The framework has been tested on real-life event data to assess the quality of the predictions and the corresponding evaluations. In particular, a user evaluation has been performed in order to understand if the explanations provided by the system were intelligible to process stakeholders. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Occupational accidents are frequent in the construction industry, containing significant risks in the working environment. Therefore, early designation, taking preventive actions, and developing a proactive safety risk management plan are of paramount significance in managing safety issues in the construction industry. This study aims to develop a national data-driven safety management framework based on accident outcome prediction, which helps anatomize precursors of fatalities and thereby minimizing fatal accidents on construction sites. A national data set comprising 338,173 occupational accidents recorded in the construction industry across Turkey was used to develop a data-driven model. The random forest algorithm coupled with particle swarm optimization was used for the prediction and the interpretability of the proposed model was augmented through the game theory-based Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) approach. The findings showed that the proposed algorithm achieved satisfactory model performances for detecting construction workers who might face a fatality risk. The SHAP analysis results indicated that both company (such as number of past accidents and workers in the company) and worker-related (such as age, daily wage, experience, shift, and past accident of the workers) attributes were influential in identifying fatalities by detecting which workers might face fatal accidents under which conditions. A construction safety management plan was developed based on the analysis results, which can be used on construction sites to detect workers/conditions that are most susceptible to fatalities. The findings of the present research are expected to contribute to orchestrating effective safety management practices in construction sites by characterizing the root causes of severe accidents. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Feature construction can contribute to comprehensibility and performance of machine learning models. Unfortunately, it usually requires exhaustive search in the attribute space or time-consuming human involvement to generate meaningful features. We propose a novel heuristic approach for reducing the search space based on aggregation of instance-based explanations of predictive models. The proposed Explainable Feature Construction (EFC) methodology identifies groups of co-occurring attributes exposed by popular explanation methods, such as IME and SHAP. We empirically show that reducing the search to these groups significantly reduces the time of feature construction using logical, relational, Cartesian, numerical, and threshold (num-of-N and X-of-N) constructive operators. An analysis on 10 transparent synthetic datasets shows that EFC effectively identifies informative groups of attributes and constructs relevant features. Using 30 real-world classification datasets, we show significant improvements in classification accuracy for several classifiers and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed feature construction even for large datasets. Finally, EFC generated interpretable features on a real-world problem from the financial industry, which were confirmed by a domain expert. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The quantum-logic inspired decision tree (QLDT) is based on quantum logic concepts and input values from the unit interval whereas the traditional decision tree is based on Boolean values. The logic behind the QLDT obeys the rules of a Boolean algebra. The QLDT is appropriate for classification problems where for a class decision several input values interact gradually with each other. The QLDT construction for a classification problem with n input attributes requires the computation of 2n minterms. The QLDT+ method, however, uses a heuristic for obtaining a QLDT with much smaller computational complexity. As result, the QLDT+ method can be applied to classification problems with a higher number of input attributes. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Prior studies have shown the importance of classroom dialogue in academic performance, through which knowledge construction and social interaction among students take place. However, most of them were based on small scale or qualitative data, and few has explored the availability and potential of big data collected from online classrooms. To address this issue, this paper analyzes dialogues in live classrooms of a large online learning platform in China based on natural language processing techniques. The features of interactive types and emotional expression are extracted from classroom dialogues. We then develop neural network models based on these features to predict high- and low-academic performing students, and employ interpretable AI (artificial intelligence) techniques to determine the most important predictors in the prediction models. In both STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) and non-STEM courses, it is found that high-performing students consistently exhibit more positive emotion, cognition and off-topic dialogues in all stages of the lesson than low-performing students. However, while the metacognitive dialogue illustrates its importance in non-STEM courses, this effect cannot be found in STEM courses. While high-performing students in non-STEM courses show negative emotion in the last stage of lessons, STEM students show positive emotion. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In the area of industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), digital twins (DTs) are a powerful means for process improvement. In this paper the concept of a DT is explained and analysis possibilities throughout the life-cycle of a product and its production system are explored. The main part of this paper is focused on an approach to the analysis of manufacturing layouts and their parameters. The approach, which is based on a state of the art bottleneck detection method, allows an intelligent representation of the temporal process characteristics. The presented method is widely applicable for any type of manufacturing layout and time-span. The use of elementary heuristics leads to traceable results that can be used for further analysis or optimization. The results of this analysis method can be integrated in a DT and combined with machine learning and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). The concept for a self-learning DT is explained and implementation possibilities are elucidated. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - We systematically investigate the links between price returns and Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) scores in the European equity market. Using interpretable machine learning, we examine whether ESG scores can explain the part of price returns not accounted for by classic equity factors, especially the market one. We propose a cross-validation scheme with random company-wise validation to mitigate the relative initial lack of quantity and quality of ESG data, which allows us to use most of the latest and best data to both train and validate our models. Gradient boosting models successfully explain the part of annual price returns not accounted for by the market factor. We check with benchmark features that ESG data explain significantly better price returns than basic fundamental features alone. The most relevant ESG score encodes controversies. Finally, we find the opposite effects of better ESG scores on the price returns of small and large capitalization companies: better ESG scores are generally associated with larger price returns for the latter and reversely for the former. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - End-of-line (EOL) quality assurance of finished components has so far required additional manual inspections and burdened manufacturers with high labor costs. To automate the EOL process, in this paper a fully AI-based quality classification system is introduced. The components are automatically placed under the optical inspection system employing a robot. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used for the quality classification of the recorded images. After quality control, the component is sorted automatically in different bins depending on the quality control result. The trained CNN models achieve up to 98.7% accuracy on the test data. The classification performance of the CNN is compared with that of a rule-based approach. Additionally, the trained classification model is interpreted by an explainable AI method to make it comprehensible for humans and reassure them about its trustworthiness. This work originated from an actual industrial use case from Witzenmann GmbH. Together with the company, a demonstrator was realized. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper, a novel single-index model tree (SIMTree) is proposed. It adopts the recursive partitioning strategy and each data segment is modeled by a single-index model (SIM), which is a flexible extension of linear regression with non-parametric link functions. The proposed SIMTree has two major advantages: a) with only a few leaf nodes, it can achieve competitive predictive performance compared to complicated black-box models; b) SIMs fitted on each local data segment are intrinsically interpretable. However, using conventional techniques to build such a SIMTree can be extremely time-consuming. SIM estimation typically involves iterative optimization via Newton-type algorithms; such a resource-intensive estimation procedure is repeatedly used for fitting leaf node SIMs and the search of optimal splits. To make the computation burden affordable, an effective training algorithm is proposed as enabled by the efficient utilization of Stein's lemma and several accelerating strategies in the tree construction algorithm. Moreover, a new Python package simtree is developed with elegant visualization modules that can further facilitate the model interpretation. Numerical results on extensive regression datasets show that SIMTree is an accurate and interpretable machine learning model. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The radiogenomics analysis can provide the connections between genomics and radiomics, which can infer the genomic features of tumors from their radiogenomic associations through the low-cost and non-invasiveness screening ultrasonic images. Although there are a number of pioneer approaches exploring the connections between genomic aberrations and ultrasonic features, these studies mainly focus on the relationship between ultrasonic features and only the most popular cancer genes, confronting two difficulties: missing many-to-many relationships as omics-to-omics view, and confounding group-specific associations with whole sample associations. To overcome the difficulty of omics-to-omics view and the issue of tumor heterogeneity, we propose an omics-to-omics joint knowledge association subtensor model. Specifically, the subtensor factorization framework can successfully discover the joint cross-modal module via an omics-to-omics view, while the sparse weight sample indication strategy can mine sample subgroups from the multi-omic data with tumor heterogeneity. The experimental evaluation result shows the jointness of the discovered modules across omics, their association with tumorigenesis contribution, and their relation for cancer related functions. In summary, our proposed omics-to-omics joint knowledge association subtensor model can serve as an efficient tool for radiogenomic knowledge associations, promoting the cross-modal knowledge graph construction of in explainable artificial intelligence cancer diagnosis. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Since early warning is significant to ensure high-quality tunneling boring machine (TBM) construction, a real-time prediction method based on TBM data is proposed. To solve the “black box” problem of prediction by artificial intelligence (AI) methods, the causal explainable gated recurrent unit (CX-GRU) is developed to achieve real-time prediction for TBM parameters. The approach is implemented in a tunnel construction project in Singapore and the results indicate that CX-GRU performs well with the R square score are 0.9140 and 0.9184 in real-time prediction for thrust force and soil pressure. The causal discovery component can increase the computational efficiency of model training by 8.8% on average. According to the SHAP analysis of prediction results, the thrust force is more sensitive to the input TBM features, while the soil pressure is more sensitive to historical data. The CX-GRU is more reliable and efficient when applied to TBM projects than traditional methods. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Supported by the combination of the advanced BIM technique with intelligent algorithms, this paper develops a systematic framework using explainable machine learning and multi-objective optimization to realize the automatic prediction and optimization of building energy performance towards the sustainable development goal. There are three critical parts incorporated, including the DesignBuilder simulation, BO-LGBM (Bayesian optimization-LightGBM) and an explainable method SHAP (SHapley Additive explanation)-based prediction and explanation of building energy performance, and AGE-MOEA algorithm-based multi-objective optimization (MOO) under sources of uncertainty. It has been verified in a case study for green building design. Results show that: (1) The predictive BO-LGBM model can make a highly precise prediction in agreement with the simulation data, reaching up the R2 larger than 93.4% and MAPE smaller than 2.13%. From the SHAP calculation, features related to the HAVC (Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning) system tend to contribute more to affecting the prediction results. (2) The AGE-MOEA-based optimization can identify a set of Pareto optimal solutions in simultaneously minimizing the building energy consumption, CO<inf>2</inf> emission, and indoor thermal discomfort degree, arriving at the highest optimization rate of 13.43% under proper adjustment of certain features. (3) In the MOO task, the consideration of model and data uncertainty by prediction intervals and Monte-Carlo simulation can further increase the optimization rate by around 4.0% than the deterministic scenario, resulting in more desired strategies in optimizing the green building performance. In short, this paper enriches the area of green building development. For one thing, it raises the transparency and interpretability of machine learning to make the prediction more convincing. For another, it efficiently determines the passive and active design solutions along with the detailed profile of influential factors for green building design. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - We present Multiscale Extrapolative Learning Algorithm (MELA) as a novel artificial-intelligence (AI)-based data extrapolator. MELA is capable of extending temporally limited local hydroclimatic measurements at fine spatial resolution to longer periods, using remotely-sensed hydroclimatic data readily available for longer periods but at coarse spatial resolution. We demonstrate the implementation of MELA to extrapolate the monthly local soil moisture measurements at multiple depths from 2015–2021 to 1958–2021 in a semi-arid region. Such data extrapolators are imperative to generate longer historical data needed to adequately train and test AI models while enhancing the chance of capturing the effects of extreme climates on spatially variable soil moisture. The MELA-extrapolated local soil moisture subsequently allowed the construction of monthly time-series of field-scale soil moisture distributions with a normalized accuracy of 72% and prediction of countywide annual winter wheat yields – using MELA-extrapolated soil moisture data and eXplainable AI (XAI) – with a normalized accuracy of 81%. Furthermore, the XAI model ranked the predictors based on their importance in estimating winter wheat yields, in which the soil moisture near the surface and in the root zone and precipitation totals were found to be more influential than temperature on crop yields in the semi-arid region. The XAI model also unveiled the inflection points of the predictors beyond which crop yields would increase or decrease. Moreover, the AI-based analyses in conjunction with climate projections from global climate models suggest potential reductions in rainfed crop yields in the study area by 2050 and 2100 in the absence of climate-resilient mitigation and adaptation plans. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cement-based grouting material, distinguished by excellent fluidity and high strength, is widely used in the field of construction reinforcement, and anchoring of restraints. Owing to the high-performance requirements and complicated influencing factors of grouting material, the design of the mixing proportion has been challenging. This study proposes a machine learning (ML) based algorithmic framework integrating prediction, interpretation, and automatic hyperparameter tuning to identify the complex potential relationships between the mixing proportion parameters on the compressive strength and fluidity of cement-based grouting materials. The 442 compressive strength data and 217 fluidity data derived from both published literatures and laboratory experiments were collected to build a dataset for demonstrating the predictive performance of the ML models. The results indicated that the hyperparameter tuning technique via Bayesian Optimisation (BO) can significantly improve the time efficiency compared to grid search, reducing time consumption from 8000 s to 197 s with comparable accuracy. The optimal prediction results were obtained based on the XGBoost model with R2 = 0.93, RMSE = 7.37 for compressive strength, and R2 = 0.92, RMSE = 16.33 for fluidity. The SHapley Additive exPlainations (SHAP) is introduced to interpret the evaluation results and the influence of the various mix factors on grouting material from both global(model) and local(instance) perspectives. The suggested model can be seen as a function of influential input variables that help engineers conduct a rapid assessment and then in turn to optimize the design of the mixture proportion. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: The global health crisis represents an unprecedented opportunity for the development of artificial intelligence (AI) solutions. This paper aims to integrate explainable AI into the decision-making process in emergency scenarios to help mitigate the high levels of complexity and uncertainty associated with these situations. An AI solution is designed to extract insights into opioid overdose (OD) that can help government agencies to improve their medical emergency response and reduce opioid-related deaths. Design/methodology/approach: This paper employs the design science research paradigm as an overarching framework. Open-access digital data and AI, two essential components within the digital transformation domain, are used to accurately predict OD survival rates. Findings: The proposed AI solution has two primary implications for the advancement of informed emergency management. Results show that it can help not only local agencies plan their resources for timely response to OD incidents, thus improving survival rates, but also governments to identify geographical areas with lower survival rates and their primary contributing factor; hence, they can plan and allocate long-term resources to increase survival rates and help in developing effective emergency-related policies. Originality/value: This paper illustrates that digital transformation, particularly open-access digital data and AI, can improve the emergency management framework (EMF). It also demonstrates that the AI models developed in this study can identify opioid OD trends and determine the significant factors improving survival rates. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Explainable artificial intelligence (AI) technology enables us to quantitatively analyze the whole prediction logic of AI as a global explanation. However, unwanted relationships learned by AI due to data sparsity, high dimensionality, and noise are also visualized in the explanation, which deteriorates confidence in the AI. Thus, methods for correcting those unwanted relationships in explanation has been developed. However, since these methods are applicable only to differentiable machine learning (ML) models but not to non-differentiable models such as tree-based models, they are insufficient for covering a wide range of ML technology. Since these methods also require re-training of the model for correcting its explanation (i.e., in-processing method), they cannot be applied to blackbox models provided by third parties. Therefore, we propose a method called ensemble-based explanation correction (EBEC) as a post-processing method for correcting the global explanation of a prediction model in a model-agnostic manner by using the Rashomon effect of statistics. We evaluated the performance of EBEC with three different tasks and analyzed its function in more detail. The evaluation results indicate that EBEC can correct global explanation of the model so that the explanation aligns with the domain knowledge given by the user while maintaining its accuracy. EBEC can be extended in various ways and combined with any method to improve correction performance since it is a post-processing-type correction method. Hence, EBEC would contribute to high-productivity ML modeling as a new type of explanation-correction method. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Spectroscopy is a widely used technique that can contribute to food quality assessment in a simple and inexpensive way. Especially in grape production, the visible and near infrared (VNIR) and the short-wave infrared (SWIR) regions are of great interest, and they may be utilized for both fruit monitoring and quality control at all stages of maturity. The aim of this work was the quantitative estimation of the wine grape ripeness, for four different grape varieties, by using a highly accurate contact probe spectrometer that covers the entire VNIR–SWIR spectrum (350–2500 nm). The four varieties under examination were Chardonnay, Malagouzia, Sauvignon-Blanc, and Syrah and all the samples were collected over the 2020 and 2021 harvest and pre-harvest phenological stages (corresponding to stages 81 through 89 of the BBCH scale) from the vineyard of Ktima Gerovassiliou located in Northern Greece. All measurements were performed in situ and a refractometer was used to measure the total soluble solids content (°Brix) of the grapes, providing the ground truth data. After the development of the grape spectra library, four different machine learning algorithms, namely Partial Least Squares regression (PLS), Random Forest regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), coupled with several pre-treatment methods were applied for the prediction of the °Brix content from the VNIR–SWIR hyperspectral data. The performance of the different models was evaluated using a cross-validation strategy with three metrics, namely the coefficient of the determination ((Formula presented.)), the root mean square error (RMSE), and the ratio of performance to interquartile distance (RPIQ). High accuracy was achieved for Malagouzia, Sauvignon-Blanc, and Syrah from the best models developed using the CNN learning algorithm ((Formula presented.), (Formula presented.)), while a good fit was attained for the Chardonnay variety from SVR ((Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.)), proving that by using a portable spectrometer the in situ estimation of the wine grape maturity could be provided. The proposed methodology could be a valuable tool for wine producers making real-time decisions on harvest time and with a non-destructive way. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Impulsivity is a multidimensional construct often associated with unfavorable outcomes. Previous studies have implicated several electroencephalography (EEG) indices to impulsiveness, but results are heterogeneous and inconsistent. Using a data-driven approach, we identified EEG power features for the prediction of self-reported impulsiveness. To this end, EEG signals of 56 individuals (18 low impulsive, 20 intermediate impulsive, 18 high impulsive) were recorded during a risk-taking task. Extracted EEG power features from 62 electrodes were fed into various machine learning classifiers to identify the most relevant band. Robustness of the classifier was varied by stratified k-fold cross validation. Alpha and beta band power showed best performance in the classification of impulsiveness (accuracy = 95.18% and 95.11%, respectively) using a random forest classifier. Subsequently, a sequential bidirectional feature selection algorithm was used to estimate the most relevant electrode sites. Results show that as little as 10 electrodes are sufficient to reliably classify impulsiveness using alpha band power (f-measure = 94.50%). Finally, the Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis approach was employed to reveal the individual EEG features that contributed most to the model's output. Results indicate that frontal as well as posterior midline alpha power seems to be of most importance for the classification of impulsiveness. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This review article examines recent advances in the use of machine learning for process industries. The article presents common process industry tasks that researchers are solving with machine learning techniques. It then identifies a lack of consensus among past studies when selecting an appropriate model given a prescribed application. Furthermore, the article identifies that relatively few past studies have considered model interpretability – a “black-box” challenge holding back machine learning's implementation in more high-risk industrial applications. This interdisciplinary field of engineering and computer science is still reasonably young. Additional research is recommended to standardize methods and establish a strategic framework to manage risk during adoption of machine learning models. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This article investigates the significant effect of artificial intelligence (AI) on the supply chain, stressing its capacity to fundamentally change various aspects of operations. The research seeks to offer an extensive review of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in the supply chain. This includes analyzing how AI may be used for demand forecasting, optimizing transportation, managing warehouses, optimizing procurement, and mitigating risks. The article showcases the concrete advantages of AI-driven solutions through the analysis of real-life scenarios. These benefits include increased precision in demand forecasting, better transportation routes, higher efficiency in warehouses, faster procurement procedures, and efficient techniques for mitigating risks. The study's findings demonstrate that AI possesses the capacity to greatly boost supply chain performance through the improvement of efficiency, reduction of costs, and increase of robustness. Nevertheless, the article also recognizes the difficulties linked to the application of AI, such as substantial upfront investment needs, worries about data privacy and security, the absence of transparency and comprehensibility, possible job displacement, and ethical considerations. In order to tackle these difficulties and enhance the influence of artificial intelligence (AI) in the supply chain, the paper suggests potential avenues for future research.

AB  - Maize Streak Disease (MSD) caused by the maize streak virus remains a significant agricultural challenge during the 4th industrial revolutions, as it poses a substantial threat to global maize crops, resulting in severe yield reductions. Effective and timely identification of the disease is pivotal in curbing its propagation and enacting appropriate control strategies. The emergence of the 5th industrial revolutions has witnessed the integration of advanced technologies into various sectors, with deep learning methodologies standing out for their prowess in diverse domains, including disease detection. Nonetheless, the inherent complexity of deep learning models hinders visibility into their transparency, preventing users from comprehending the underlying features and decision-making processes. This opacity often leads to reduced user trust, even when the models demonstrate high accuracy rates.In this research, we introduce an interpretable machine learning framework through explainable AI (XAI) that harnesses the capabilities of deep learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for the identification of the Maize Streak Disease. This framework not only exploits the potential of deep learning for precise disease classification but also integrates techniques for model interpretability. The proposed methodology capitalizes on CNN architectures to extract discerning features from an extensive dataset of MSD-affected leaf images. The trained CNN model is then coupled with interpretable techniques such as SHAP and LIME.Empirical findings highlight that this easy-to-understand deep learning approach is very effective in correctly diagnosing the Maize Streak Disease. The TensorFlow-designed model achieves a commendable accuracy of 96%.In essence, this study presents a novel interpretable machine learning framework that seamlessly integrates deep learning with interpretability methods to tackle the challenge of Maize Streak Disease. Beyond achieving exceptional classification precision, this research provides a transparent window into the decision-making mechanisms of the model. With a pronounced emphasis on interpretability, this study endeavors to bridge the gap between the potent predictive capacities of deep learning and the imperative for intelligible and dependable diagnostic systems within the agricultural disease domain.The implications of this work extend to the 5th industrial revolutions by bolstering agricultural productivity, mitigating yield losses, and enhancing the efficiency and efficacy of Intelligent Agricultural Support Systems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Admittedly, it is of paramount guiding significance to construct a scientific comprehensive evaluation system for university teachers' teaching performance to promote the overall improvement of university teaching quality. Despite the continuous emergence of evaluation models for teachers' performance, they are typically beset with two significant challenges, one of which lies in their limited ability to describe the expression degree of prior knowledge based on the importance degree of features and to optimize the fuzzification process quantitatively. The other challenge can be summarized as the failure of consequent parameters of fuzzy rules in executing the solution process conveniently and adaptively, as well as the adverse influence of redundant information in fuzzy rules on the model's prediction results. To tackle the foregoing challenges, this paper proposes a new fuzzy classification strategy to determine the corresponding important factors by leveraging the importance of critical features selected based on information gain. This is further employed to realize quantitative optimization of the features' membership degree, thereby improving the overall fuzzification process. On the other hand, this paper proposes a novel method for obtaining the consequent parameters, which can not only optimize the redundant expression in fuzzy rules by using multiple correlation coefficients but also flexibly make the predicted output infinitely close to the true value, thus improving the generalization performance of the model and enhancing its linguistic interpretability. Also, this aligns with the explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), a current research hotspot. The experimental results demonstrate that the model proposed in this paper exhibits excellent decision-making ability, generalization performance, and linguistic interpretability on the adopted teacher performance evaluation datasets. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Crop leaf diseases pose a significant challenge to global agriculture, leading to substantial economic losses and reduced yields. These ailments, caused by various pathogens, manifest as symptoms such as leaf discoloration and impaired photosynthesis, severely impacting crop health and productivity. Existing classification methods face challenges related to accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability. This study introduces an innovative solution that combines a meticulously designed lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture with a channel attention (CA) mechanism for extracting crucial features and leverages the discriminative power of an extreme learning machine (ELM) for classification. The lightweight CNN developed demonstrates significantly reduced training times. Additionally, the CA mechanism within the model effectively prioritizes channel-wise critical features while eliminating irrelevant and redundant ones. An empirical evaluation is conducted using a publicly available dataset and the proposed model achieves a flawless 100% accuracy in distinguishing between 39 distinct crop leaf diseases. Furthermore, the study employs gradient class activation maps (Grad-CAM) visualization to delve into the model's decision-making process, shedding light on influential factors and regions. It holds the promise of transforming crop health and agricultural yields, instilling hope for farmers and researchers dedicated to achieving agricultural prosperity and sustainability. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Plant diseases pose a significant threat to global food security by limiting access to safe and abundant food sources while impacting agricultural productivity and food safety. To address this challenge, innovative disease detection techniques are crucial. This paper presents a novel approach to tomato leaf disease detection grounded in deep transfer learning. We employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to recognize and categorize diseases, leveraging pre-trained models such as EfficientNetB3, Xception, and MobileNetV2. Our experimental results highlight the efficacy of these models, with the CNN achieving an accuracy of 0.92, MobileNetV2 at 0.93, Xception at 0.94 and EfficientNetB3 at 0.993. By combining these machine learning techniques with image processing methods, we create a system capable of diagnosing tomato leaf diseases promptly. The system employs image processing techniques to facilitate disease recognition, enabling automated disease identification as soon as symptoms manifest on leaves or plants. This empowers farmers with timely information and appropriate treatment options, ultimately leading to precise disease management. Furthermore, our research delves into model interpretability by employing Saliency maps and Grad-CAM techniques, providing valuable insights into the decision-making process of our deep learning models. This transparency enhances the trustworthiness of the AI-driven disease detection system, fostering its practical application in agriculture. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Numerous trucks and container cargo are shifting in port areas, and special attention is required for safety management to prevent accidents. Particularly, in 'port terminal', the severity of the accident can be high in terms of human damage. Previous studies attempt to predict and detect port accidents, however, research on deriving major factors influencing port-accident severity and developing accident severity prediction models in port areas are rare. Therefore, to prepare safety management strategies, it is necessary to derive risk factors that affect the accident severity in each port area. This study developed an accident severity model using both statistical and machine learning techniques, including the Multilevel Bayesian logit model, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). In data preparation, oversampling and clustering techniques are applied, which can augment data and separate accident risk situations to any characteristics of port accident data. As a consequence, port-accident severity models are developed with heterogeneous accident data. In this process, a severity model suitable for the characteristics of Korean ports was established by considering the heterogeneity of accident data. After developing the severity model, an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) was used to find key variables affecting port-accident occurrence. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In the transportation sector, implementing digital twins is part of the digitization measure to improve resource efficiency in infrastructure management. However, the use of digital twins is still limited due to challenges such as a lack of shared understanding of digital twin models, complex model integration, security issues, lack of access to essential data, and high costs due to inefficient business models. This research develops an asset management platform suitable for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) for the cross-company, secure, and intuitive collaborative management of digital twin assets. It can be achieved by developing an ontology-based semantic model of the assets, explainable machine learning (XAI), and a scenario-based intelligent search and discovery mechanism. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Cybersecurity is a growing problem in today's technological innovation and new digital economy. Threat actors cause a danger to people's safety or lead to the compromise of intellectual property, either sold on the dark web or used as leverage for ransom. Many executives believe cybersecurity is the responsibility of Information Technologies (IT). It is everyone's responsibility. Countering cyber threats requires focusing on people and behaviors and cognitive models; the mere technicalities are not enough to face the issue. With this in mind, the following research analyzes existing frameworks in the literature for developing serious games for cybersecurity. They are developed to train and educate individuals in various aspects of cybersecurity, including threat detection, incident response, and risk management. Moreover, combining serious games and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be a powerful approach to cybersecurity training and education. By integrating Explainable AI techniques into serious games, users can better understand the decision-making processes within the game environment. Players can learn how to interpret the explanations provided by AI models, identify potential limitations or errors, and make decisions based on both AI-generated insights and their own domain knowledge. This combination equips individuals with the skills to improve perception and human factors in cybersecurity. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Graph Neural Networks have achieved notable success, yet explaining their rationales remains a challenging problem. Existing methods, including post-hoc and interpretable approaches, have numerous limitations. Post-hoc methods treat models as black boxes and can mislead users, while interpretable models often overlook user-centric explanations. Furthermore, most existing methods do not carefully consider the user's perception of explanations, potentially resulting in explanation-user mismatches. To address these problems, we propose a novel interpretable concept-matching model to enhance GNN interpretability and prediction accuracy. The proposed model extracts frequent concepts from input graphs using the graph information bottleneck theory and modified constraints. These concepts are managed in an in-memory concept corpus for efficient inference lookups and explanation generation. Various explanation construction features are implemented based on the concept corpus and the discovery module, aiming to fulfill diverse user preferences. Extensive experiments and a user study validate the performance of the proposed approach, showcasing its potential for improving model accuracy and interpretability. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The costs involved in manually reviewing documents in legal civil litigations have grown dramatically as more and more information is stored electronically. As a result, the document review process can require an extraordinary dedication of resources. In construction litigations, quickly finding supporting documentation in a delay dispute is critical to the success of a matter. Identifying relevant delay-related communications and supporting documentation has historically been expensive and time consuming. Using machine learning technologies, respondents can be more comprehensive in their assessment of the data requiring review to respond to the claim in time. Explainable machine learning is an active machine learning research area, and in an explainable machine learning system, predictions generated from a machine learning model are explainable and human understandable. In delay dispute 'document review' scenarios, a document can be identified as delay-related, as long as one or more of the text snippets in a document are deemed delay-related. In these scenarios, if these delay-related snippets can be located, then attorneys could easily evaluate the model's decision. The authors of this paper propose an approach for accurately identifying rationales and an approach for boosting document classification accuracy using delay-related snippets and their applications in construction delay disputes. The authors conducted experiments using data from a few real world delay dispute matters and the results from these experiments show that the proposed approaches have the potential to significantly advance the application of text classification in document review in construction delay dispute matters. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Entity matching (EM), also known as record linkage, is crucial in data integration, cleaning, and knowledge base construction. Modern matching techniques leverage deep learning and pre-trained language models (PLMs) to effectively identify matching records, showcasing significant advancements over traditional methods. However, certain critical matching aspects have received limited attention in these techniques. They heavily rely on PLMs' encodings and face challenges in integrating external sources of knowledge to enhance matching accuracy. Additionally, these techniques often lack transparency, impeding users' understanding of the underlying rationale for matching decisions. Furthermore, they exhibit limitations and decreased performance in handling heterogeneous records from datasets with diverse schemas. This paper presents EXKG, a novel technique that addresses these challenges and effectively matches heterogeneous records with varying attributes. EXKG combines the power of knowledge graphs (KGs) and PLMs to perform record linkage while offering explanatory insights into the matching results. We demonstrate that EXKG achieves competitive performance through experimental studies compared to state-of-the-art matching techniques. As a by-product, our solution generates explanations that give end users a comprehensive understanding of the matching process. We evaluate the quality of these explanations by using a user study and show they empower end users to make informed decisions © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Dark patterns are deceptive user interface designs for online services that make users behave in unintended ways. Dark patterns, such as privacy invasion, financial loss, and emotional distress, can harm users. These issues have been the subject of considerable debate in recent years. In this paper, we study interpretable dark pattern auto-detection, that is, why a particular user interface is detected as having dark patterns. First, we trained a model using transformer-based pre-trained language models, BERT, on a text-based dataset for the automatic detection of dark patterns in e-commerce. Then, we applied post-hoc explanation techniques, including local interpretable model agnostic explanation (LIME) and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP), to the trained model, which revealed which terms influence each prediction as a dark pattern. In addition, we extracted and analyzed terms that affected the dark patterns. Our findings may prevent users from being manipulated by dark patterns, and aid in the construction of more equitable internet services.

AB  - The second-order analysis of slender steel members could be challenging, especially when large deflection is involved. This paper proposes a novel machine learning-based structural analysis (MLSA) method for second-order analysis of beam-columns, which could be a promising alternative to the prevailing solutions using over-simplified analytical equations or traditional finite-element-based methods. The effectiveness of the conventional machine learning method heavily depends on both the qualitative and the quantitative of the provided data. However, such data are typically scarce and expensive to obtain in structural engineering practices. To address this problem, a new and explainable machine learning-based method, named Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINN), is employed, where the physical information will be utilized to orientate the learning process to create a self-supervised learning procedure, making it possible to train the neural network with few or even no predefined datasets to achieve an accurat e approximation. This research extends the PINN method to the problems of second-order analysis of steel beam-columns. Detailed derivations of the governing equations, as well as the essential physical information for the training process, are given. The PINN framework and the training procedure are provided, where an adaptive loss weight control algorithm and the transfer learning technic are adopted to improve numerical efficiency. The practicability and accuracy of which are validated by four sets of ver ification examples. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Knowledge graphs (KGs) are gaining prominence in Healthcare AI, especially in drug discovery and pharmaceutical research as they provide a structured way to integrate diverse information sources, enhancing AI system interpretability. This interpretability is crucial in healthcare, where trust and transparency matter, and eXplainable AI (XAI) supports decisionmaking for healthcare professionals. This overview summarizes recent literature on the impact of KGs in healthcare and their role in developing explainable AI models. We cover KG workflow, including construction, relationship extraction, reasoning, and their applications in areas like Drug-Drug Interactions (DDI), Drug Target Interactions (DTI), Drug Development (DD), Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR), and bioinformatics. We emphasize the importance of making KGs more interpretable through knowledge-infused learning in healthcare. Finally, we highlight research challenges and provide insights for future directions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Supplier Selection under Procurement remains a relatively unexplored issue in Supply Chain Management. It is a key factor that overlooks the enforcement of good buying decisions, satisfying stakeholders, minimizing maverick spending and hitting performance targets. Through provider determination, an association looks at, surveys, and draws in providers. The Provider Choice cycle uses an excessive measure of an organisation's resources and is habitually crucial to the productivity of any firm. So far, the extent of sending man-made intelligence-supported provider determination models has been restricted to the acquisition of C-type items. This is because of the presence of undetected predispositions in the framework, the powerlessness of computer-based intelligence models to consider subjective boundaries, the absence of significant datasets, and equivocalness in regards to the choice made by the calculation. The development of Explainable AI has given us a collection of tools and frameworks that make it simpler to comprehend and interpret the predictions provided by machine learning models, enabling us to create AI that is more inclusive and understandable. In addition, a number of recent studies have demonstrated a strong correlation between weightable statistics and qualitative parameters like a supplier's market reputation. Subsequently, in this task, a blend of numerical, measurable, and simulated intelligence approaches are utilised to check the exhibition and reasonableness of a provider in light of goal and emotional characteristics. A post-hoc Explainable AI structure is then added to help find bias, drift, and other data gaps and close them. It also increases end-user trust by making information more transparent and providing explanations that can be understood by humans. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - We propose the concept of 'explainergy', a new way of including explainability in the metaheuristic performance of algorithms solving problems in the energy domain. To this end, we open the discussion around eXplainable computational Intelligence (XCI), focusing on using metaheuristic optimization for complex energy-related problems. It is well known that computational intelligence applied to optimization cannot guarantee optimality theoretically and also faces issues related to premature convergence, tuning parameters, and variability of the results. These aspects slow the adoption of such methods by energy industry practitioners. Our proposal considers incorporating ideas already applied to the artificial intelligence paradigm, namely those related to eXplainable AI, to motivate current research in this field and provide solutions from metaheuristics with explainability character-istics. Through a case study solving a bidding problem in local electricity markets, we shed light on some ideas that might be advantageous to understanding the metaheuristic performance for energy experts unfamiliar with approximate algorithms. If an XCI framework is successfully developed, it can increase metaheuristic adoption, reliability, and broader success. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - We present an explainable digital-twin framework designed for cardiovascular health monitoring by integrating feature extraction using the NeuroKit2 and Heartpy python libraries and predictive modeling through machine learning. The digital-twin extracts key physiological features from ECG data, such as heart rate variability, and utilized machine learning algorithms to predict individual cardiovascular status. To improve trustworthiness, interpretability and transparency behind the decision making process, SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) was paired to help describe the underlying contributions of each feature to the model's decision-making process. The performance of the machine learning model scored a 90.08 % at accurately predicting abnormal or normal ECG signal. The combination of extraction of key features from ECG signals and a trained explainable machine learning model offers transparent, personalized insights into cardiovascular health. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Digital Twin can be developed to represent a certain soil carbon emissions ecosystem that takes into account various parameters such as the type of soil, vegetation, climate, human interaction, and many more. With the help of sensors and satellite imagery, real-time data can be collected and fed into the digital model to simulate and predict soil carbon emissions. However, the lack of interpretable prediction results and transparent decision-making results makes Digital Twin unreliable, which could damage the management process. Therefore, we proposed an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) empowered Digital Twin for better managing soil carbon emissions through AI-enabled proximal sensing. We validated our XAIoT-DT components by analyzing real-world soil carbon content datasets. The preliminary results demonstrate that our framework is a reliable tool for managing soil carbon emissions with relatively high prediction results at a low cost. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In the era of advanced manufacturing, digital twins have emerged as a foundational technology, offering the promise of improved efficiency, precision, and predictive capabilities. However, the increasing presence of AI tools for digital twin models and their integration into industrial processes has brought forth a pressing need for trustworthy and reliable systems. Uncertainty-Aware eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (UAXAI) is proposed as a critical paradigm to address these challenges, as it allows for the quantification and communication of uncertainties associated with predictive models and their corresponding explanations. As a platform and guiding philosophy to promote human-centered trust, UAXAI is based on five fundamental pillars: accessibility, reliability, explainability, robustness, and computational efficiency. The development of UAXAI caters to a diverse set of stakeholders, including end users, developers, regulatory bodies, the scientific community, and industrial players, each with their unique perspectives on trust and transparency in digital twins. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The decrease in power quality due to the increase in the linkage to distributed power facilities is a major factor that lowers the reliability of power supply. In order to minimize the degradation of power quality due to the variability caused by the distributed energy resources connected to the distribution system, it is necessary to predict the load fluctuation of the distribution system in advance. Based on the predicted load fluctuation, it is possible to minimize the increase in the variability of the distribution system due to the uncertainty of the distributed power source through power quality pre-monitoring and diagnosis. This paper aims to analyse the influence of distributed power supply connected to the distribution system on power loss. By using the XAI-based power quality impact evaluation and analysis model proposed in this paper, it will be possible to prevent the degradation of power loss due to the connection of distributed energy resources in advance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The best performance and longevity of industrial machinery are dependent on predictive maintenance. The proposed framework is a reliable and effective predictive maintenance tool that makes use of the widely used NASA-bearing dataset. It uses advanced machine learning algorithms in a multi-step procedure that includes data preparation, anomaly identification, and fault categorization. Then we tried to learn the underlying patterns in the data using an autoencoder, a potent unsupervised learning technique, and then set a threshold to detect anomalies. Anomalies are defined as deviations from the reconstructed signal, which the autoencoder is trained to recreate from the input data. Next, we employed k-shape clustering, a state-of-the-art time-series clustering method, to group similar patterns together in the latent representation obtained from the autoencoder. This enables us to obtain more accurate anomaly labels and improve fault classification accuracy. To further enhance the accuracy of the framework, we extracted several features from the data, including the poisson process, latent representation, frequency, and time domain features. These features are then used as inputs to a decision tree classifier, a popular machine-learning algorithm that can handle both categorical and numerical data. Additionally, we experimented with the gradient boost classifier, a boosting algorithm that improves the performance of the decision tree classifier. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves an accuracy of 95 percent using the gradient boost classifier, outperforming traditional approaches. The combination of the autoencoder-based anomaly detection and the decision tree classifier with the extracted features provides a powerful predictive maintenance framework that can improve the reliability and performance of machinery, reduce downtime and maintenance costs, and ultimately enhance overall productivity in various industrial settings. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems in Industry 4.0 has gained momentum due to their potential for increasing efficiency and productivity. However, AI systems can be just as complex and opaque, leading to concerns about their reliability, trustworthiness, and accountability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a validation framework for Explainable AI (XAI) in Industry 4.0 based on Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs). The proposed framework aims to evaluate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) based on a set of AI metrics and XAI metrics. The FCM-based approach enables the representation of causal-effect relationships between the different concepts of the system using expert knowledge. The presented validation framework provides a theoretical background for evaluating and optimizing the business values of AI systems based on multiple criteria in the manufacturing industry, demonstrating its effectiveness. The main contributions of this paper are: i) the development of an FCM-based validation framework for XAI in Industry 4.0; ii) the identification of relevant AI and XAI metrics for the evaluation of the KPIs of the theoretical graph model; and iii) the demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed framework through a case study. The results of this study provide valuable insights into the importance of considering not only accuracy but also efficiency and transparency when developing AI pipelines that generate higher business value. Overall, this paper offers a theoretical foundation and practical insights for organizations seeking to evaluate the business values of their AI systems in Industry 4.0. It emphasizes the importance of explainability and the integration of AI and XAI metrics in achieving transparent and accountable AI solutions that deliver optimal results for the manufacturing industry and beyond. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Explainable AI is an emerging field that aims to address how black-box decisions of AI systems are made, by attempting to understand the steps and models involved in this decision-making. Explainable AI in manufacturing is supposed to deliver predictability, agility, and resiliency across targeted manufacturing apps. In this context, large amounts of data, which can be of high sensitivity and various formats need to be securely and efficiently handled. This paper proposes an Asset Management and Secure Sharing solution tailored to the Explainable AI and Manufacturing context in order to tackle this challenge. The proposed asset management architecture enables an extensive data management and secure sharing solution for industrial data assets. Industrial data can be pulled, imported, managed, shared, and tracked with a high level of security using this design. This paper describes the solutiońs overall architectural design and gives an overview of the functionalities and incorporated technologies of the involved components, which are responsible for data collection, management, provenance, and sharing as well as for overall security. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Peer-to-peer (P2P) lenders face regulatory, compliance, application, and data security risks. A complete methodology that includes more than statistical and economic methods is needed to conduct credit assessments effectively. This study uses systematic literature network analysis and artificial intelligence to comprehend risk management in P2P lending financial technology. This study suggests that explainable AI (XAI) is better at identifying, analyzing, and evaluating financial industry risks, including financial technology. This is done through human agency, monitoring, transparency, and accountability. The LIME Framework and SHAP Value are widely used machine learning frameworks for data integration to speed up and improve credit score analysis using bank-like criteria. Thus, machine learning is expected to be used to develop a precise and rational individual credit evaluation system in peer-to-peer lending to improve credit risk supervision and forecasting while reducing default risk. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

In the context of the manufacturing industry, where complex problems and decision-making processes are widespread, the XMANAI platform emerges as a solution to enable transparent and trustworthy collaboration between humans and machines. By leveraging advancements in XAI and catering the prompt collaboration between data scientists and domain experts, the platform enables the construction of interpretable AI models that offer high transparency without compromising performance. This paper introduces the approach to building the XMANAI platform and highlights its potential to resolve the “transparency paradox” of AI. The platform not only addresses technical challenges related to transparency but also caters to the specific needs of the manufacturing industry, including lifecycle management, security, and trusted sharing of AI assets. The paper provides an overview of the XMANAI platform main functionalities, addressing the challenges faced during the development and presenting the evaluation framework to measure the performance of the delivered XAI solutions. It also demonstrates the benefits of the XMANAI approach in achieving transparency in manufacturing decision-making, fostering trust and collaboration between humans and machines, improving operational efficiency, and optimizing business value. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - It is a very popular era for machine learning (ML) applications, and Industry5.0 aims to have AI as one of its key technologies. Still, only a few ML initiatives make it to a production-grade implementation, mostly due to lacking proper Continuous Integration and Delivery framework and MLOps practices. This is especially true for industrial use cases, where the trust and reliability of ML applications are mission-critical. Most of these applications fail during the final stage of the development lifecycle, i.e. acceptance testing and validation of the ML application, while being integrated into Cyber-Physical System of Systems (CPSoS). This paper explores the key requirements for deploying ML applications in industrial scenarios, emphasizing the critical role of Digital Twins, edge AI, and responsible-explainable AI techniques in ensuring efficient and responsible operations. Building upon previous models, this paper suggests two process models: (i) the Olympics model for MLOps-coupled CPS engineering and (ii) the MLOps engineering toolchain for industrial applications. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - There has been a meteoric rise in the application of AI during the past decade. Researchers are looking into using AI algorithms in almost every domain. AI algorithms are being used in modern agricultural research and practices for a variety of tasks, from quality control to increasing agricultural production. Using Deep Learning algorithms can be difficult because of their heuristic character. Class Activation based approaches like CAM and Gradient based CAM have emerged and greatly improved the model's explainability. In this paper we have classified rice grain based on their images and showed that the convolutional neural networks capture the shape of these grains for the classification task based on their quality whereas researchers have use morphological based features for classifying the rice grains based on their quality. We have used Grad-CAM, to show that the CNN captures the shape of the rice grains. We have explored state of the art CNN architectures like AlexNet, ResNet18 and VGG-16 along with a four convolutional layer CNN for the work. We show how the Grad-CAM localizes the shape of the various rice grains and the class for which it fails. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The Metaverse is an online universe that combines virtual reality and augmented reality, linked together via a network.It has generated novel experiences that are fully engaging and transpire in real time, facilitating interpersonal communication and dialogue. Virtual environments with 3D space and avatars can boost patient-facing platforms, operational utilisation, digital education, diagnostics, and treatment choices in medicine and ophthalmology. Globally, there is an increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, with an estimated 25 percent of individuals presently contending with multiple chronic health issues. The management of chronic diseases is currently being rethought in light of the development of technology known together as 'Smart Healthcare.' A prime example is state-of-the-art wearable technology that incentivizes people to embrace healthier lifestyles through the monitoring of physiological indicators and metabolic processes. With better data organisation and analysis, chronic disease patients may benefit from improved health, privacy, and quality of life. Through the examination of physiological data acquired from wearable devices on a patient, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the capability to generate informed recommendations pertaining to the diagnosis and treatment of illness. These recommendations can be provided by AI. The adoption of blockchain technology (BC) has the potential to significantly advance healthcare in a variety of ways, including decentralised data sharing, user privacy, user empowerment, and dependability in data administration. The potential impact of Wearable Technologies (WT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Blockchain Technology (BC) on Chronic Disease Management (CDM) could be a transition in emphasis from the hospital to the patient. This article provides a patient-centered technical framework for controlling chronic diseases using artificial intelligence, blockchain, and wearable technologies. Our proposed architecture depends on Metaverse environment. In order to participate in the Metaverse, both patients and physicians need to sign up on the Blockchain network. After entering, customers will be accompanied by avatars throughout the experience. A comprehensive record of all information gathered during doctor-patient consultations, including text, videos, images, audio, and clinical data, will be compiled, uploaded to the blockchain, and stored in perpetuity. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) algorithms examine these particulars in order to diagnose and forecast the progression of diseases. We conclude with a discussion of the constraints of this novel paradigm and recommendations for future research. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Industry 5.0 is a new paradigm that seeks to improve production via the use of cutting-edge technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing. Distributed denial of service (DDoS) assaults, for example, may severely harm industrial processes and disrupt the whole supply chain, but this integration of technology also presents significant security issues. Therefore, it is crucial in the age of Industry 5.0 to create reliable DDoS attack detection systems. In this research, we offer a DDoS attack detection system for the Industry 5.0 environment that makes use of Digital Twins (DTs) and Machine Learning (ML). Our method takes use of the strengths of DTs to model the production flow virtually, which can then be used to track the system's behaviour and spot any hiccups. For further analysis of the DTs' output data in order to spot possible DDoS assaults, we use explicable ML algorithms like the decision tree classifier. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In wafer fabrication, data is collected and analyzed to prevent process deviations that could affect product quality and wafer yield. However, the high-dimensional, sparse, and imbalanced nature of the data poses significant challenges to yield and quality root cause analysis. Deep Topological Data Analysis (DTDA) is an unsupervised machine learning method that clusters and models the data in the form of geometric objects such as graphs and their higher-dimensional versions. This method reduces the multidimensional dataset to two-dimensional networks or graphs, where each node represents a cluster of samples with similar characteristics, and an edge represents the presence of overlapping characteristics between the connecting nodes. DTDA provides insights into the necessary data elements required to conduct accurate analysis and helps engineers identify the features contributing to yield and quality issues, enabling corrective actions. Moreover, the approach prevents the waste of engineering resources and mitigates the impact on final manufacturing cost. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The domain of Artificial Intelligence has become ubiquitous across a wide plethora of domains and is now an integral part of the daily life of the ordinary citizen. While the need for increased transparency of the highly accurate black-box model is an important and very active area of research, the produced explanations themselves might not always be accurate. The measures to assess the quality of explanations are an important research topic. In this paper, a set of extensive experiments is performed to evaluate the stability of SHAP explanations under conditions of different noise types and different noise intensities as an effort to build a formal way of assessing the quality of explanations provided by the SHAP algorithm. The experiments are performed on four different datasets, with three different noise types at four different strength levels. The impact of the scenarios on SHAP explanations is reported, the implications for the evaluation of explainability methods are elaborated upon, along with the significance of the results for the SHAP method of explanations. The future directions are laid out thereafter. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The field of explainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) has gained growing attention over the last few years due to the potential for making accurate data-based predictions of asset health. One of the current research aims in AI is to address challenges associated with adopting machine learning (ML) (i.e., data-driven) AI – that is, understanding how and why ML predictions are made. Despite ML models successfully providing accurate predictions in many applications, such as condition monitoring, there are still concerns about the transparency of the prediction-making process. Therefore, ensuring that the models used are explainable to human users is essential to build trust in the approaches proposed. Consequently, AI and ML practitioners need to be able to evaluate any available eXplainable AI (XAI) tools’ suitability for their intended domain and end users, while simultaneously being aware of the tools’ limitations. This paper provides insight into various existing XAI approaches and their limitations to be considered by practitioners in condition monitoring applications during the design process for an ML-based prediction. The aim is to assist practitioners in engineering applications in building interpretable and explainable models intended for end users who wish to improve a system’s reliability and help users make better-informed decisions based upon a predictive ML algorithm output. It also emphasizes the importance of explainability in AI. The paper applies some of these tools to an explainability use case in which real condition monitoring data is used to predict the degradation of a roto-dynamic pump. Additionally, potential avenues are explored to enhance the credibility of explanations generated by XAI tools in condition monitoring applications, aiming to offer more reliable explanations to domain experts. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The proliferation of Artificial Intelligence in various domains has led to a growing demand for explainability. However, most modern Artificial Intelligence models are complex and opaque, making it challenging to interpret their decision-making process. The lack of transparency and interpretability of AI systems can pose significant risks, such as erroneous decisions, biased outcomes, and ethical concerns. To address these issues, various proposals have been put forth to generate explanations for black box models, both agnostic and model-dependent, and to evaluate these explanations using qualitative or quantitative measures. While these proposals have been useful in generating and evaluating explanations for AI models, none has focused on improving model quality using these evaluations. Regularization techniques, employed to introduce a quality bias into a solution, involve incorporating an additional term into the loss function to ensure that the model satisfies certain quality criteria, such as augmenting explainability. In this paper, the LIFR regularization term to improve the quality of AI models with respect to explainability is presented. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a benchmark dataset and discuss its potential applications. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Crack segmentation is a crucial task in various domains, particularly in infrastructure inspection, civil engineering, and road maintenance. To accurately detect various cracks from the input RGB images, two artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have been presented for segmentation purpose: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and transformer-based techniques (ViT). In this study, we present a comparative analysis to evaluate the robustness of convolutional networks against ViT. CNNs are built upon a series of convolutional and pooling layers, designed to capture local patterns and features in an image. On the other hand, ViTs utilize self-attention mechanisms to capture global relationships within a sequence of input patches from the image. In addition to quantitative evaluation comparison, qualitative visual explainable heat saliency maps are derived. We use two crack datasets for comparison evaluation purposes: Crack500 and DeepCrack. We compare the evaluation results among six XAI models (three models for each; CNN and ViT). The segmentation results show the commutative measurements among the CNN and ViT models. Such a comprehensive comparison study could be helpful to assist the researchers in the domain for the best model selection. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Since the fourth industrial revolution began, Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have become cornerstones in the activities of many organizations. Nonetheless, the application of ML and AI techniques is often limited due to mistrust among users regarding the results obtained by the algorithms. This can lead to decisions not being made correctly. Both facts demonstrate that current algorithms need to be interpretable and transparent. EXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques are paramount to this objective as they translate black-box algorithms into transparent logic for developers and users. However, despite different XAI approaches evaluate dimensions through metrics, there is no consensus on how to evaluate XAI. In an effort to standardize the evaluation of XAI and allow users the comparison of the ideal XAI solution for their problem, we present an approach focused on the evaluation of XAI quality, which is able to be applied in Model Driven Development (MDD) scenarios. The great advantages of our proposal are that it (i) provides a set of quality metrics to evaluate the multiple relevant XAI and AI dimensions, (ii) provides a holistic evaluation thanks to these quality metrics, (iii) emphasizes the relevance of identifying the different target users involved, and (iv) enables the comparison across different XAI alternatives. In order to show the applicability of our proposal, we apply it to a widely-known case study: chess. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Agriculture has been an essential and foundational activity for human societies since the dawn of civilization and nowadays serves as the backbone of economies worldwide. Efforts to understand and to enhance agricultural productivity are crucial for addressing global challenges and achieving sustainable development goals. This research study focuses on analyzing the factors influencing production of the flagship crops of the 32 states in Mexico. A regression tree model was employed as an explainable artificial intelligence technique to gain insights into the production patterns. The study utilized a dataset containing various agricultural variables, including territorial extension, precipitation mean, and temperature measurements across different months. Quantitative and qualitative approaches were employed to understand the significance of predictors. Through permutation importance analysis, it was identified that territorial extension, precipitation mean, and specific temperature measures, such as minimum temperature in January and mean temperature in November, had a substantial impact on crop production. Additionally, a visual analysis of the pruned regression tree further confirmed the importance of these predictors. The findings led to the formulation of seven production rules, which provide valuable guidance for agricultural decision-making. The results highlight the potential of the regression tree model as an explainable tool for understanding and predicting crop production. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are successful but work as black-boxes. Elucidating their inner workings is crucial as DNNs are prone to reproducing data biases and potentially harm underrepresented or historically discriminated demographic groups. In this work, we demonstrate an approach for visualizing DNN activations that facilitates to visually detect biases in learned representations. This approach displays activations as topographic maps, similar to common visualization of brain activity. In addition to visual inspection of activations, we evaluate different measures to quantify the quality of the topographic maps. With visualization and measurement of quality, we provide qualitative and quantitative means for investigating bias in representations and demonstrate this for activations of a pre-trained image recognition model when processing images of peoples' faces. We find biases for different sensitive variables, particularly in deeper layers of the investigated DNN, and support the subjective evaluation with a quantitative measure of visual quality. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - As machine learning models become increasingly complex, there is a growing need for explainability to understand and trust the decision-making processes. In the domain of network intrusion detection, post-hoc feature relevance explanations have been widely used to provide insight into the factors driving model decisions. However, recent research has highlighted challenges with these methods when applied to anomaly detection, which can vary in importance and impact depending on the application domain. In this paper, we investigate the challenges of post-hoc feature relevance explanations for network intrusion detection, a critical area for ensuring the security and integrity of computer networks. To gain a deeper understanding of these challenges for the application domain, we quantitatively and qualitatively investigate the popular feature relevance approach SHAP when explaining different network intrusion detection approaches. We conduct experiments to jointly evaluate detection quality and explainability, and explore the impact of replacement data, a commonly overlooked hyperparameter of post-hoc feature relevance approaches. We find that post-hoc XAI can provide high quality explanations, but requires a careful choice of its replacement data as default settings and common choices do not transfer across different detection models. Our study showcases the viability of post-hoc XAI for network intrusion detection systems, but highlights the need for rigorous evaluations of produced explanations. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Interpretable part-prototype models are computer vision models that are explainable by design. The models learn prototypical parts and recognise these components in an image, thereby combining classification and explanation. Despite the recent attention for intrinsically interpretable models, there is no comprehensive overview on evaluating the explanation quality of interpretable part-prototype models. Based on the Co-12 properties for explanation quality as introduced in [42] (e.g., correctness, completeness, compactness), we review existing work that evaluates part-prototype models, reveal research gaps and outline future approaches for evaluation of the explanation quality of part-prototype models. This paper, therefore, contributes to the progression and maturity of this relatively new research field on interpretable part-prototype models. We additionally provide a “Co-12 cheat sheet” that acts as a concise summary of our findings on evaluating part-prototype models. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - An integrated system for processing sensor data has been developed based on novel variational autoencoder (VAE) algorithms with explainability that significantly eases analysis of sensor data. By continuously updating a generative model of the data, the system assists users with minimal artificial intelligence (AI) training or experience to perform data analysis. The system performs an extensive range of integrated machine learning (ML) tasks: anomaly detection, active learning, model-drift detection, synthetic data generation, semi-supervised classification, and counterfactual explanation generation. When the system is provided a data schema (map of Booleans, integers, reals, categories, time series, etc.) and data set, it automatically forms a preliminary generative model of the data. The construction of the system is modular, so new data types can be added as necessary. Counterfactually explainable anomaly detection is immediately performed via sparse gradient search. This informs the user how to interactively remove or repair bad records and/or begin labeling records of interest. The addition of labels to the data allows multi-class, semi-supervised, counterfactually explainable classification via the support vector machine embedded hyperplane algorithm (SVM-EH). Once some labels are added, active learning is used to assist further labeling by suggesting data elements that are highly likely to improve classification accuracy, significantly accelerating the labeling process by trading human effort for computational cycles. In production, the system detects when its training is becoming stale and requests retraining. Classification accuracy is demonstrated to be comparable to other deep learning systems on benchmark data sets. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The industry 4.0 is leveraging digital technologies and machine learning techniques to connect and optimize manufacturing processes. Central to this idea is the ability to transform raw data into human understandable knowledge for reliable data-driven decision-making. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been instrumental in processing image data, yet, their “black box” nature complicates the understanding of their prediction process. In this context, recent advances in the field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) have proposed the extraction and localization of concepts, or which visual cues intervene on the prediction process of CNNs. This paper tackles the application of concept extraction (CE) methods to industry 4.0 scenarios. To this end, we modify a recently developed technique, “Extracting Concepts with Local Aggregated Descriptors” (ECLAD), improving its scalability. Specifically, we propose a novel procedure for calculating concept importance, utilizing a wrapper function designed for CNNs. This process is aimed at decreasing the number of times each image needs to be evaluated. Subsequently, we demonstrate the potential of CE methods, by applying them in three industrial use cases. We selected three representative use cases in the context of quality control for material design (tailored textiles), manufacturing (carbon fiber reinforcement), and maintenance (photovoltaic module inspection). In these examples, CE was able to successfully extract and locate concepts directly related to each task. This is, the visual cues related to each concept, coincided with what human experts would use to perform the task themselves, even when the visual cues were entangled between multiple classes. Through empirical results, we show that CE can be applied for understanding CNNs in an industrial context, giving useful insights that can relate to domain knowledge. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In XAI it is important to consider that, in contrast to explanations for professional audiences, one cannot assume common expertise when explaining for laypeople. But such explanations between humans vary greatly, making it difficult to research commonalities across explanations. We used the dual nature theory, a techno-philosophical approach, to cope with these challenges. According to it, onan explain, for example, an XAI’s decision by addressing its dual nature: by focusing on the Architecture (e.g., the logic of its algorithms) or the Relevance (e.g., the severity of a decision, the implications of a recommendation). We investigated 20 explanations of games using the theory as an analytical framework. We elaborate how we used the theory to quickly structure and compare explanations of technological artifacts. We supplement results from analyzing the explanation contents with results from a video recall to explore how Explainers (EX) justified their explanation. We found that EX were focusing on the physical aspects of the game first (Architecture) and only later on aspects of the Relevance. Reasoning in the video recalls indicated that EX regarded the focus on the Architecture as important for structuring the explanation initially by explaining the basic components before focusing on more complex, intangible aspects. EX justified shifting between addressing the two sides by explanation goals, emerging misunderstandings, and the knowledge needs of the explainee. We discovered several commonalities that inspire future research questions which, if further generalizable, provide first ideas for the construction of synthetic explanations. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has gained significant attention recently as the demand for transparency and interpretability of machine learning models has increased. In particular, XAI for time series data has become increasingly important in finance, healthcare, and climate science. However, evaluating the quality of explanations, such as attributions provided by XAI techniques, remains challenging. This paper provides an in-depth analysis of using perturbations to evaluate attributions extracted from time series models. A perturbation analysis involves systematically modifying the input data and evaluating the impact on the attributions generated by the XAI method. We apply this approach to several state-of-the-art XAI techniques and evaluate their performance on three time series classification datasets. Our results demonstrate that the perturbation analysis approach can effectively evaluate the quality of attributions and provide insights into the strengths and limitations of XAI techniques. Such an approach can guide the selection of XAI methods for time series data, e.g., focusing on return time rather than precision, and facilitate the development of more reliable and interpretable machine learning models for time series analysis. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents our work on the SemEval-2023 Task 10 Explainable Detection of Online Sexism (EDOS) (Kirk et al., 2023) using lexicon-based models. Our approach consists of three main steps: lexicon construction based on Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) and Shapley value, lexicon augmentation using an unannotated corpus and Large Language Models (LLMs), and, lastly, lexical incorporation for Bag-of-Word (BoW) logistic regression and fine-tuning LLMs. Our results demonstrate that our Shapley approach effectively produces a high-quality lexicon. We also show that simply counting the presence of certain words in our lexicons and comparing the count can outperform a BoW logistic regression in task B/C and fine-tuning BERT in task C. In the end, our classifier achieved F1-scores of 53.34% and 27.31% on the official blind test sets for tasks B and C, respectively. We, additionally, provide an in-depth analysis highlighting model limitations and bias. We also present our attempts to understand the model’s behavior based on our constructed lexicons. Our code and the resulting lexicons are open-sourced in our GitHub repository https://github.com/SirBadr/SemEval2023-Task10. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The interest in metaverse applications by existing industries has seen massive growth thanks to the accelerated pace of research in key technological fields and the shift towards virtual interactions fueled by the Covid-19 pandemic. One key industry that can benefit from the integration into the metaverse is healthcare. The potential to provide enhanced care for patients affected by multiple health issues, from standard afflictions to more specialized pathologies, is being explored through the fabrication of architectures that can support metaverse applications. In this paper, we focus on the persistent issues of lung cancer detection, monitoring, and treatment, to propose MetaLung, a privacy and integrity-preserving architecture on the metaverse. We discuss the use cases to enable remote patient-doctor interactions, patient constant monitoring, and remote care. By leveraging technologies such as digital twins, edge computing, explainable AI, IoT, and virtual/augmented reality, we propose how the system could provide better assistance to lung cancer patients and suggest individualized treatment plans to the doctors based on their information. In addition, we describe the current implementation state of the AI-based Decision Support System for treatment selection, I3LUNG, and the current state of patient data collection. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Inherently explainable Machine Learning (ML) models are able to provide explanations for their predictions by virtue of their construction. The explanations of a ML model are more comprehensible if they are expressed in terms of its input features. Our paper proposes an inherently explainable pipeline for document classification using pattern structures and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. The pipeline generates two kinds of explanations: intermediate and final ones, that justify its classifications. Intermediate explanations are represented as significant subgraphs found in the document graphs of test documents. Final explanations are the sentences of the test documents, that correspond to the significant subgraphs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years, the community of 'explainable artificial intelligence' (XAI) has created a vast body of methods to bridge a perceived gap between model 'complexity' and 'interpretability'. However, a concrete problem to be solved by XAI methods has not yet been formally stated. As a result, XAI methods are lacking theoretical and empirical evidence for the 'correctness' of their explanations, limiting their potential use for quality-control and transparency purposes. At the same time, Haufe et al. (2014) showed, using simple toy examples, that even standard interpretations of linear models can be highly misleading. Specifically, high importance may be attributed to so-called suppressor variables lacking any statistical relation to the prediction target. This behavior has been confirmed empirically for a large array of XAI methods in Wilming et al. (2022). Here, we go one step further by deriving analytical expressions for the behavior of a variety of popular XAI methods on a simple two-dimensional binary classification problem involving Gaussian class-conditional distributions. We show that the majority of the studied approaches will attribute non-zero importance to a non-class-related suppressor feature in the presence of correlated noise. This poses important limitations on the interpretations and conclusions that the outputs of these XAI methods can afford. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The use of artificial intelligence (AI) methods in automated production is currently still very challenging. Adapted AI solutions are too difficult to transfer to other use cases, the setup and operation of AI approaches require in-depth technical know-how, and their results are often difficult and incompletely comprehensible by humans. In addition, data treasures are sometimes available in companies, but there is a lack of tools to evaluate them. In an interdisciplinary project funded by the Carl-Zeiss-Foundation, these problems are addressed by research, and possible solutions are shown based on industrial lead applications. In addition to the lead applications and the promised industrial cooperation, the “Center for industrial AI” will be established as a permanent structure at Heilbronn University to ensure a sustainable transfer of results. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Research in the field of explainable artificial intelligence has produced a vast amount of visual explanation methods for deep learning-based image classification in various domains of application. However, there is still a lack of domain-specific evaluation methods to assess an explanation’s quality and a classifier’s performance with respect to domain-specific requirements. In particular, evaluation methods could benefit from integrating human expertise into quality criteria and metrics. Such domain-specific evaluation methods can help to assess the robustness of deep learning models more precisely. In this paper, we present an approach for domain-specific evaluation of visual explanation methods in order to enhance the transparency of deep learning models and estimate their robustness accordingly. As an example use case, we apply our framework to facial expression recognition. We can show that the domain-specific evaluation is especially beneficial for challenging use cases such as facial expression recognition and provides application-grounded quality criteria that are not covered by standard evaluation methods. Our comparison of the domain-specific evaluation method with standard approaches thus shows that the quality of the expert knowledge is of great importance for assessing a model’s performance precisely. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has emerged as a crucial topic in the field of machine learning to provide insights into the reasoning performed by artificial intelligence (AI) systems. However, the lack of a clear definition of explanation and a standard methodology for evaluating the quality of explanations has made it challenging to develop effective XAI systems. One commonly used approach is Local Linear Explanations, but the evaluation of their quality is still unclear due to theoretical inconsistencies. This issue is even more challenging in image recognition, where visual explanations often detect edges rather than providing clear explanations for decisions. To address this issue, several metrics that quantitatively measure different aspects of explanation quality in a robust and mathematically consistent manner has been proposed. On this work, we apply the REVEL framework approach, which standardizes the concept of explanation and allows for the comparison of different explanations and the absolute evaluation of individual explanations. We provide a guide of the REVEL framework to perform an optimization process that aims to improve the explainability of machine learning models. We apply the proposed five metrics on the CIFAR 10 benchmark and demonstrate their descriptive, analytical and optimization power. Our work contributes to the development of XAI systems that provide reliable and interpretable explanations for AI reasoning. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A trustworthy application of Artificial Intelligence requires to measure in advance its possible risks. When applied to regulated industries, such as banking, finance and insurance, Artificial Intelligence methods lack explainability and, therefore, authorities aimed at monitoring risks may not validate them. To solve this issue, explainable machine learning methods have been introduced to “interpret” black-box models. Among them, Shapley values are becoming popular: they are model agnostic and easy to interpret. However, they are not normalised and, therefore, cannot become a standard procedure for Artificial Intelligence risk management. This paper proposes an alternative explainable machine learning method, based on Lorenz Zonoids, that is statistically normalised, and can therefore be used as a standard for the application of Artificial Intelligence. The empirical analysis of 15,000 small and medium companies asking for credit confirms the advantages of our proposed method. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Disaster risk management practitioners have the responsibility to make decisions at every phase of the disaster risk management cycle: mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery. The decisions they make affect human life. In this paper, we consider the current state of the use of AI in information extraction (IE) for disaster risk management (DRM), which makes it possible to leverage disaster information in social media. We consolidate the challenges and concerns of using AI for DRM into three main areas: limitations of DRM data, limitations of AI modeling and DRM domain-specific concerns, i.e., bias, privacy and security, transparency and accountability, and hype and inflated expectations. Then, we present a systematic discussion of how explainable AI (XAI) can address the challenges and concerns of using AI for IE in DRM. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper, for the very first time, introduces human sketches to the landscape of XAI (Explainable Artificial Intelligence). We argue that sketch as a 'human-centred' data form, represents a natural interface to study explainability. We focus on cultivating sketch-specific explainability designs. This starts by identifying strokes as a unique building block that offers a degree of flexibility in object construction and manipulation impossible in photos. Following this, we design a simple explainability-friendly sketch encoder that accommodates the intrinsic properties of strokes: shape, location, and order. We then move on to define the first ever XAI task for sketch, that of stroke location inversion (SLI). Just as we have heat maps for photos, and correlation matrices for text, SLI offers an explainability angle to sketch in terms of asking a network how well it can recover stroke locations of an unseen sketch. We offer qualitative results for readers to interpret as snapshots of the SLI process in the paper, and as GIFs on the project page. A minor but interesting note is that thanks to its sketch-specific design, our sketch encoder also yields the best sketch recognition accuracy to date while having the smallest number of parameters.

AB  - Explainable AI (XAI) is slowly becoming a key component for many AI applications. Rule-based and modified backpropagation XAI approaches however often face challenges when being applied to modern model architectures including innovative layer building blocks, which is caused by two reasons. Firstly, the high flexibility of rule-based XAI methods leads to numerous potential parameterizations. Secondly, many XAI methods break the implementation-invariance axiom because they struggle with certain model components, e.g., BatchNorm layers. The latter can be addressed with model canonization, which is the process of restructuring the model to disregard problematic components without changing the underlying function. While model canonization is straightforward for simple architectures (e.g., VGG, ResNet), it can be challenging for more complex and highly interconnected models (e.g., DenseNet). Moreover, there is only little quantifiable evidence that model canonization is beneficial for XAI. In this work, we propose canonizations for currently relevant model blocks applicable to popular deep neural network architectures, including VGG, ResNet, EfficientNet, DenseNets, as well as Relation Networks. We further suggest a XAI evaluation framework with which we quantify and compare the effects of model canonization for various XAI methods in image classification tasks on the Pascal VOC and ILSVRC2017 datasets, as well as for Visual Question Answering using CLEVR-XAI. Moreover, addressing the former issue outlined above, we demonstrate how our evaluation framework can be applied to perform hyperparameter search for XAI methods to optimize the quality of explanations.

AB  - The goal of Explainable AI (XAI) is to make the reasoning of a machine learning model accessible to humans, such that users of an AI system can evaluate and judge the underlying model. Due to the blackbox nature of XAI methods it is, however, hard to disentangle the contribution of a model and the explanation method to the final output. It might be unclear on whether an unexpected output is caused by the model or the explanation method. Explanation models, therefore, need to be evaluated in technical (e.g. fidelity to the model) and user-facing (correspondence to domain knowledge) terms. A recent survey has identified 29 different automated approaches to quantitatively evaluate explanations. In this work, we take an additional perspective and analyse which toolkits and data sets are available. We investigate which evaluation metrics are implemented in the toolkits and whether they produce the same results. We find that only a few aspects of explanation quality are currently covered, data sets are rare and evaluation results are not comparable across different toolkits. Our survey can serve as a guide for the XAI community for identifying future directions of research, and most notably, standardisation of evaluation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The power of a wind turbine has a multivariate dependence on environmental conditions and working parameters. Hence, traditional univariate models which take as input solely the wind speed may fail in effectively monitoring the performance of wind turbines. To address this limitation, the use of multivariate wind power curves, which consider multiple variables and output power, should be investigated. For this reason, the Authors of this paper advocate the role of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods in the construction of multivariate data-driven power curve models. A sequential features selection is applied and the Shapley coefficients for the various input sensors are computed on a real-world data set, which is composed of a set of covariates larger than the state of the art in the literature. The experimental results of this work lead to include in the model highly explanatory variables related to the mechanical or electrical control, such as the rotational speed and the blade pitch pressures, which use has not been contemplated in the literature before. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has gained considerable attention in recent years as it aims to help humans better understand machine learning decisions, making complex black-box systems more trustworthy. Visual explanation algorithms have been designed to generate heatmaps highlighting image regions that a deep neural network focuses on to make decisions. While convolutional neural network (CNN) models typically follow similar processing operations for feature encoding, the emergence of vision transformer (ViT) has introduced a new approach to machine vision decision-making. Therefore, an important question is which architecture provides more human-understandable explanations. This paper examines the explain-ability of deep architectures, including CNN and ViT models under different vision tasks. To this end, we first performed a subjective experiment asking humans to highlight the key visual features in images that helped them to make decisions in two different vision tasks. Next, using the human-annotated images, ground-truth heatmaps were generated that were compared against heatmaps generated by explanation methods for the deep architectures. Moreover, perturbation tests were performed for objective evaluation of the deep models' explanation heatmaps. According to the results, the explanations generated from ViT are deemed more trustworthy than those produced by other CNNs, and as the features of the input image are more dispersed, the advantage of the model becomes more evident. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Machine learning models are increasingly being applied in safety-critical domains. Therefore, ensuring their trustworthiness and reliability has become a priority. Uncertainty measures the lack of trust in these models, and explanation systems designed as twin systems can provide insights into model decisions to users. Case-based reasoning (CBR) is an experience-based problem-solving methodology with applications across various domains. In this work, we propose a novel approach to generate a twin system, specifically a multi-agent CBR system (MA-CBR system), which utilizes feature attribution-based Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to explain black-box models in multi-class classification tasks. The proposed approach provides contrastive or supportive instance-based explanations, enabling users to interpret model outputs. Furthermore, we introduce an evaluation metric to assess the system’s quality based on its supportiveness for the performance of the underlying black-box model, which we measure through a confidence score. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we apply it to three distinct datasets with differing characteristics. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in generating explanations for black-box models in multi-class classification tasks. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Evaluation of generative models has been an underrepresented field despite the surge of generative architectures. Most recent models are evaluated upon rather obsolete metrics which suffer from robustness issues, while being unable to assess more aspects of visual quality, such as compositionality and logic of synthesis. At the same time, the explainability of generative models remains a limited, though important, research direction with several current attempts requiring access to the inner functionalities of generative models. Contrary to prior literature, we view generative models as a black box, and we propose a framework for the evaluation and explanation of synthesized results based on concepts instead of pixels. Our framework exploits knowledge-based counterfactual edits that underline which objects or attributes should be inserted, removed, or replaced from generated images to approach their ground truth conditioning. Moreover, global explanations produced by accumulating local edits can also reveal what concepts a model cannot generate in total. The application of our framework on various models designed for the challenging tasks of Story Visualization and Scene Synthesis verifies the power of our approach in the model-agnostic setting. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The understanding of cognitive load plays a key role in increasing the potential of human-centric systems. Recently, cognitive load detection has attracted the attention of researchers. Competitions are being held and relevant data are being released in this regard. Managing cognitive load through wearable devices in daily life contributes, amongst others, to industrial safety. Wearable bands require high prediction results with less data because of their limited battery and processing power. Therefore, by detecting important features that characterize cognitive load, we aimed to obtain a high load detection classification accuracy using few features. In total, we detected 179 features such as heart rate variabilities, descriptive statistical, and frequency features. Important features were detected using the independent t-test and SHapley additive exPlanation (SHAP). Furthermore, an accuracy of 70.3% was obtained with only ten important features using the LightGBM classifier. Heart rate variability and galvanic skin response were used as the important features. Additionally, the discrete wavelet transform was used as a more important frequency-domain feature than the discrete cosine transform. The proposed cognitive load detection method achieved higher accuracy with fewer features using a lighter classifier than those reported by existing CogLoad data studies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The carbon dioxide (CO<inf>2</inf>) fertilization effect has captured worldwide attention, owing to its tremendous potential to challenge existing predictions of future climate. However, quantifying the CO<inf>2</inf> fertilization effect (CFE) has proven to be challenging, given that it is closely entangled with other ecological and environmental processes. Recent years have witnessed significant advances with breakthroughs using theoretical methods to infer the CFE from eddy covariance tower measurements. Building on earlier findings, this study presents an innovative approach that utilizes explainable machine-learning techniques - describing the partial dependence of the response variable to each explanatory variable - to quantify the global CFE from remote-sensing platforms with an averaged R2 of 0.85. This study provides the first data-driven evidence of the global CFE and confirms the potential for extrapolation to the globe. The findings suggest that: 1) the employment of satellite vegetation proxies contributed to more than 50% of the fitting of gross primary productivity (GPP) and 2) the manifestation of the CO<inf>2</inf> fertilization impact demonstrated heterogeneity among various types of ecosystems, and in some cases, an adverse effect was detected in broadleaf forests. Our results have significant implications for the preservation and protection of terrestrial ecosystems, particularly for a carbon-neutral future. This study, therefore, provides a valuable contribution to the growing body of knowledge in this area and highlights the potential of innovative analytical techniques to address complex ecological challenges. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has accelerated the development of several systems that are elicited from it. This boom has made the systems vulnerable to security attacks and allows considerable bias in order to handle errors in the system. This puts humans at risk and leaves machines, robots, and data defenseless. Trustworthy AI (TAI) guarantees human value and the environment. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art on how to build a Trustworthy and eXplainable AI, taking into account that AI is a black box with little insight into its underlying structure. The paper also discusses various TAI components, their corresponding bias, and inclinations that make the system unreliable. The study also discusses the necessity for TAI in many verticals, including banking, healthcare, autonomous system, and IoT. We unite the ways of building trust in all fragmented areas of data protection, pricing, expense, reliability, assurance, and decision-making processes utilizing TAI in several diverse industries and to differing degrees. It also emphasizes the importance of transparent and post hoc explanation models in the construction of an eXplainable AI and lists the potential drawbacks and pitfalls of building eXplainable AI. Finally, the policies for developing TAI in the autonomous vehicle construction sectors are thoroughly examined and eclectic ways of building a reliable, interpretable, eXplainable, and Trustworthy AI systems are explained to guarantee safe autonomous vehicle systems. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Explainable Artificial Intelligence is a recent research direction that aims to explain the results of the Deep learning model. However, many recent research need to go into depth in evaluating the effectiveness of deep learning models in classifying image objects. For that reason, the research proposes two stages in the process of applying Explainable Artificial Intelligence, including: (1) assessing the accuracy of the deep learning model through evaluation methods, (2) using Grad-CAM for model interpretation aims to evaluate the feature detection ability of an image when recognized by deep learning models. The deep learning models included in the evaluation included VGG16, ResNet50, ResNet50V2, Xception, EfficientNetV2, InceptionV3, DenseNet201, MobileNetV2, MobileNet, NasNetMobile, RegNetX002, and InceptionResNetV2 on our updated VegNet dataset is available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/enalis/tomatoes-dataset. The results show that the MobieNet model has high accuracy but less reliability than EfficientNetV2S and Xception. However, MobileNetV2's accuracy is the highest when considering the ratio match rate. The research results contribute to the construction of intelligent agricultural support systems (using automatic fruit-picking robots, removing poor-quality fruits,...) from the results of the Explainable AI model to be able to use the optimal deep learning model in processing. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Substantial advances in oculomotoric biometric identification have been made due to deep neural networks processing non-aggregated time series data that replace methods processing theoretically motivated engineered features. However, interpretability of deep neural networks is not trivial and needs to be thoroughly investigated for future eye tracking applications. Especially in medical or legal applications explanations can be required to be provided alongside predictions. In this work, we apply several attribution methods to a state of the art model for eye movement-based biometric identification. To asses the quality of the generated attributions, this work is focused on the quantitative evaluation of a range of established metrics. We find that Layer-wise Relevance Propagation generates the least complex attributions, while DeepLIFT attributions are the most faithful. Due to the absence of a correlation between attributions of these two methods we advocate to consider both methods for their potentially complementary attributions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - People of all ages can contract pneumonia, a deadly respiratory illness that is more common in underdeveloped countries. For successful treatment and higher survival rates, pneumonia must be accurately and quickly diagnosed. While chest X-ray imaging is a frequently used diagnostic technique for detecting pneumonia, its interpretation can be arbitrary and error-prone. In this study, we used a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to construct a computer-aided diagnostic system for pneumonia identification in chest X-ray images. Our dataset comprises 5,863 anterior-posterior view X-ray pictures that have been divided into two categories: normal and pneumonia. The photos were chosen from the Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center's pediatric patients between the ages of one and five, and they were first checked for quality control before being judged by two highly qualified doctors. A third expert also reviewed the assessment set to verify correctness. For the test set, our CNN model performed well, with 99% accuracy, 99% precision, 99.25% f1-score, and 98% specificity. To improve the interpretability of our model, we also included explainable AI techniques like Grad-CAM and Grad-CAM++. These approaches offer insights into CNN's decision-making process. Our computer-aided diagnosis system offers a trustworthy and unbiased method for detecting pneumonia in chest X-ray pictures, which can help with the quick identification and treatment of this potentially fatal condition. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - As AI has been applied in many decision-making processes, ranging from loan application approval to predictive policing, the interpretability of machine learning models is increasingly important. Interpretable models and post-hoc explainability are two approaches in eXplainable AI (XAI). We follow the argument that transparent models should be used instead of black-box ones in real-world applications, especially regarding high-stakes decisions. In this paper, we propose PolyFIT to address two major issues in XAI: (1) bridging the gap between black-box and interpretable models and (2) experimentally validating the trade-off relationship between model performance and explainability. PolyFIT is a novel polynomial model construction method assisted by the knowledge of feature interactions in black-box models. PolyFIT uses extracted feature interaction knowledge to build interaction trees, which are then transformed into polynomial models. We evaluate the predictive performance of PolyFIT with baselines using four publicly available data sets, Titanic survival, Adult income, Boston house price, and California house price. Our method outperforms linear models by 5% and 56% in classification and regression tasks on average, respectively. We also conducted usability studies to derive the trade-off relationship between model performance and explainability. The studies validate our hypotheses about the actual relationship between model performance and explainability. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Risk management is essential to every organization’s management plan. It is the strategy by which organizations handle the risks involved with their actions to profit or avoid making decisions that will cost them financially in each activity. Identifying and mitigating potential digital threats and developing and implementing procedures to significantly reduce the likelihood of an organization being targeted by cyberattacks are at the core of effective risk management. This is especially true regarding the risks associated with an organization’s digital footprint. A particularly significant threat to reputation, but also at the same time indirect and direct costs, is the data breach that occurs when a security incident occurs about the data for which the organization is responsible, which results in a violation of confidentiality, availability, or the integrity of the data it manages. On the other hand, the rapid development of technology has transformed the agricultural industry, allowing for large-scale farming based on machine learning and other advanced tools. However, this transformation also exposes farms to cyber risks that can lead to costly data breaches. In this study, we propose a framework for incorporating explainable machine learning (exML) techniques into large-scale farming to enhance cyber risk analysis, mitigate cyber threats, and foster a sustainable rural economy. Specifically, given that an organization needs to implement the appropriate technical and organizational measures to avoid possible data breaches, this work presents an analytical stochastic modeling of risk with a multi-criteria objective function of low complexity, a factor in an incentive system, to model investment value and cost balancing. The motivation behind the proposed method is to improve cybersecurity, protect data and reputation, foster a sustainable rural economy, leverage explainable machine learning, and adapt to the changing technological landscape. By addressing these motivations, the method aims to provide a comprehensive and effective approach to cyber risk analysis in large-scale farming. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Motivated by mitigating potentially harmful impacts of technologies, the AI community has formulated and accepted mathematical definitions for certain pillars of accountability: e.g. privacy, fairness, and model transparency. Yet, we argue this is fundamentally misguided because these definitions are imperfect, siloed constructions of the human values they hope to proxy, while giving the guise that those values are sufficiently embedded in our technologies. Under popularized methods, tensions arise when practitioners attempt to achieve each pillar of fairness, privacy, and transparency in isolation or simultaneously. In this position paper, we push for redirection. We argue that the AI community needs to consider all the consequences of choosing certain formulations of these pillars-not just the technical incompatibilities, but also the effects within the context of deployment. We point towards sociotechnical research for frameworks for the latter, but push for broader efforts into implementing these in practice. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Explainable artificial intelligence is proposed to provide explanations for reasoning performed by artificial intelligence. There is no consensus on how to evaluate the quality of these explanations, since even the definition of explanation itself is not clear in the literature. In particular, for the widely known local linear explanations, there are qualitative proposals for the evaluation of explanations, although they suffer from theoretical inconsistencies. The case of image is even more problematic, where a visual explanation seems to explain a decision while detecting edges is what it really does. There are a large number of metrics in the literature specialized in quantitatively measuring different qualitative aspects, so we should be able to develop metrics capable of measuring in a robust and correct way the desirable aspects of the explanations. Some previous papers have attempted to develop new measures for this purpose. However, these measures suffer from lack of objectivity or lack of mathematical consistency, such as saturation or lack of smoothness. In this paper, we propose a procedure called REVEL to evaluate different aspects concerning the quality of explanations with a theoretically coherent development which do not have the problems of the previous measures. This procedure has several advances in the state of the art: it standardizes the concepts of explanation and develops a series of metrics not only to be able to compare between them but also to obtain absolute information regarding the explanation itself. The experiments have been carried out on four image datasets as benchmark where we show REVEL's descriptive and analytical power. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Software defect and code smell prediction help developers identify problems in the code and fix them before they degrade the quality or the user experience. The prediction of software defects and code smells is challenging, since it involves many factors inherent to the development process. Many studies propose machine learning models for defects and code smells. However, we have not found studies that explore and compare these machine learning models, nor that focus on the explainability of the models. This analysis allows us to verify which features and quality attributes influence software defects and code smells. Hence, developers can use this information to predict if a class may be faulty or smelly through the evaluation of a few features and quality attributes. In this study, we fill this gap by comparing machine learning models for predicting defects and seven code smells. We trained in a dataset composed of 19,024 classes and 70 software features that range from different quality attributes extracted from 14 Java open-source projects. We then ensemble five machine learning models and employed explainability concepts to explore the redundancies in the models using the top-10 software features and quality attributes that are known to contribute to the defects and code smell predictions. Furthermore, we conclude that although the quality attributes vary among the models, the complexity, documentation, and size are the most relevant. More specifically, Nesting Level Else-If is the only software feature relevant to all models. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - As explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has grown in popularity, it has become possible to more clearly explain the functional correspondence between airspace and traffic flow, which can alleviate the contradiction between the continuously increasing traffic demand in the terminal area and the limited airspace capacity; this paper studies the three-dimensional sectorization in the terminal area based on the airspace function. First, trajectory clustering is adopted to classify the functions of air traffic flows. Then, a functional sectorization framework is proposed to enable different airspace sectors with varied functions, where specifically the functional consistency objective between the airspace sector and the traversed air traffic flows is proposed. Third, a corresponding efficient algorithm is designed to generate functional sectors with an accurate scope that can well separate different traffic flows. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated by the actual operation datasets in the Shanghai terminal area. The results show that the method proposed in this paper can not only generate three-dimensional sectors with specific functions according to the prevailing traffic flow in the complex terminal area, which is conducive to the construction of controllers' situational awareness, but also can reduce potential conflicts and traffic density variance, increasing average sector flight time a lot. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Downtime caused by equipment failure is the biggest productivity problem in the 24-hour a day operations of the semiconductor industry. Although some equipment failures are inevitable, increases in productivity can be gained if the causes of failures can be detected quickly and repaired, thus reducing downtime. Univariate control charts are commonly used to detect failures. However, because of the complexity of the process and the structural characteristics of the equipment, detection and identification of the causes of failures may be difficult. The purpose of this study is to use correlations of variables to detect failures in semiconductor equipment, to predict the parts to be replaced and to identify the primary causes of failures. The proposed method consists of four steps: (1) conversion of the multivariate time series data of the equipment into signature matrixes, (2) detection of anomalies through a convolutional autoencoder, (3) learning classification models with supervised learning methods that use the residual matrixes of fault sections, and (4) application of an explainable algorithm to interpret the classification model. The effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method are demonstrated by the actual multivariate time series data obtained from 8-inch ashing process equipment that produces semiconductors on 8-inch silicon wafers. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - As deep learning has been successfully deployed in diverse applications, there is an ever increasing need to explain its decision. To explain decisions, case-based reasoning has proved to be effective in many areas. The prototype-based explanation is a method that provides an explanation of the model's prediction using the distance between an input and learned prototypes to effectively perform case-based reasoning. However, existing methods are less reliable because distance is not always consistent with human perception. In this study, we construct a latent space which we call an explanation space with distributional embedding and latent space regularization. This explanation space ensures that similar (in terms of human-interpretable features) images share similar latent representations, and therefore provides a reliable explanation for the consistency between distance-based explanation and human perception. The explanation space also provides additional explanation by transition, allowing the user to understand the factors that affect the distance. Throughout extensive experiments including human evaluation, we have shown that the explanation space provides a more human-understandable explanation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite the increased attention to explainable AI, explainability methods for understanding reinforcement learning (RL) agents have not been extensively studied. Failing to understand the agent’s behavior may cause reduced productivity in human-agent collaborations, or mistrust in automated RL systems. RL agents are trained to optimize a long term cumulative reward, and in this work we formulate a novel problem on how to generate explanations on when an agent could have taken another action to optimize an alternative reward. More concretely, we aim at answering the question: What does an RL agent need to do differently to achieve an alternative target outcome? We introduce the concept of a counterfactual policy, as a policy trained to explain in which states a black box agent could have taken an alternative action to achieve another desired outcome. The usefulness of counterfactual policies is demonstrated in two experiments with different use-cases, and the results suggest that our solution can provide interpretable explanations. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Damage assessment applied to reinforced concrete elements is one of the main activities of infrastructure maintenance tasks. Among these elements, the problem of corrosion in reinforced concrete is particularly critical and requires careful consideration. Annually, governments invest a large amount of economic resources in this activity. However, most methodologies for damage assessment rely on visual inspection, which may be subjectively interpreted, producing inconsistent results and requiring a considerable amount of time and resources. This study evaluates the performance of real-time object detection using You Only Look Once, version 3, for detecting corrosion damage in concrete structures. The architecture of YOLOv3 is based on a complex, but efficient, convolutional neural network fed by a dataset proposed and labeled by the authors. Two training stages were established to improve the model precision, using transfer learning with medium- and high-resolution training images. The test results show satisfactory concrete-corrosion detection through validation photographs and videos demonstrating the capabilities of explainable artificial intelligence and its applications in civil engineering. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Every decade technology makes revolutionary shifts that become the new platforms on which application technology is built. Artificial intelligence (AI) is no different. AI has moved from 1st Generation shallow learning and handcrafted features to 2nd Generation deep learning, which has been effective at learning patterns. We have now entered the 3rd Generation of AI which is machine reasoning-driven – where the machine can interpret decision making algorithm, even if it has the black-box nature. Explainable artificial intelligence and augmented intelligence are the main part of the 3rd Generation of AI. The role of Professor Lotfi Zadeh and Professor Rafik Aliev in these AI generations are tremendous. Professor L. Zadeh was the founder of the theory of fuzzy sets and linguistic variables, the “father” of fuzzy logic and approximate reasoning, the author of the theory of possibility and general theory of uncertainty, the creator of Z-numbers theory and generalized restrictions, the ancestor of granular and soft computing. His ideas and theories not only opened a new epoch in the development of scientific thought, free from the limitations of narrow scientific directions and contributing to their synergy. They made a significant contribution to the development of new information and cognitive technologies, led to the creation of effective industrial technologies, such as fuzzy computers and processors, fuzzy regulators, fuzzy clustering and recognition systems, and many others. Professor L. Zadeh has been deservedly included in the IEEE Computer Society's gallery of fame scientists who have made pioneering contributions to the field of artificial intelligence and intelligent systems. The role of L. Zadeh in AI is also hard to overestimate especially in the l focus on the concept of soft computing, originally combining hybrid models based on fuzzy sets, neural networks, and soft computing. The emergent properties of these models were one of the foundations of the current hype in artificial intelligence and machine learning. For many years L. Zadeh fruitfully cooperated with Professor Rafik Aliev. The result of their research was fundamental scientific achievements published in several joint monographs. The generalized theory of stability created by L. Zadeh and R. Aliev jointly has been recognized as a major contribution to the development of mathematics, management theory, dynamic economics and a number of other sciences. The main scientific directions of Professor Rafik Aliev’s research are the theory of decision-making in terms of high uncertainty, the theory of coordination in complex social, economic, and technical systems, fuzzy logic, and neurocomputing. Applied fields of his scientific results are economics, conflictology, space objects and technical systems. These areas of modern artificial intelligence are referred to augmented intelligence (intelligence decision-making). Augmented intelligence is a design pattern for a human-centered partnership model where humans and artificial intelligence work together to improve cognitive functions, including learning, decision-making, and new experiences. The business value forecast for augmented intelligence in 2025 will be 44 percent of all AI business applications. Explainable artificial intelligence now represents a key area of research in artificial intelligence and an unusually promising one in which many fuzzy logics could become crucial. Research in the of area of explainable artificial intelligence can be divided into three stages, which correlates with the 3 generation of AI: in the first stage (starting from 1970) expert systems were developed; in the second stage (mid-1980s), the transition was made from expert systems to knowledge-based systems; and in the third phase (since 2010), deep architectures of artificial neural networks, which required new global research on the construction of explainable systems, have been studied. On each stage the ideas of L. Zadeh and R. Aliev played the important roles. They were the first ones in explainable artificial intelligence field with neuro-fuzzy systems – a synergistic combination of fuzzy logic and neural networks, providing the first interpretable AI system based on neural network learning. Since 2011 L. Zadeh had been involved in Z Advanced Computing, Inc. (ZAC), the pioneer Cognitive Explainable Artificial Intelligence (Cognitive XAI). The Cognitive Explainable-AI approach also use the results of Prof. Rafik Aliev, Prof. Ronald Yager, Prof. Mo Jamshidi. Nowadays, explainable and augmented intelligence are prominent and fruitful research fields where many of Zadeh’s and R. Aliev’s contributions can become crucial if they are carefully considered and thoroughly developed. It is worth noting that about 30% of publications in Scopus related to XAI, dated back to 2017 or earlier, came from authors well recognized in the fuzzy logic field. This is mainly due to the commitment of the fuzzy community to produce interpretable intelligent systems since interpretability is deeply rooted in the fundamentals of fuzzy logic. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have not only transformed the way we work (i.e. how we integrate information, analyse data, and how we make decisions) but also how organisations operate (i.e. adding new business processes and services etc.). In fact, many private, public and even third sector organisations are now capitalising on the true value of having systems that can learn on their own without any human intervention. However, with these benefits also come challenges regarding project productivity and collaboration. In detail, the need to explain how these systems work and how organisations interpret their output to achieve transparency and trust. This paper details the potential of using Extended reality (XR) as a way for enabling Explainable AI (XAI) focusing on the design and development of a novel XAI XR solution. The paper also highlights the ‘positive’ responses from an initial solution evaluation study noting participant’s impressions of the solution. It then makes recommendations for further research and development into the effectiveness of XR for explainable AI. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Employees are the key to an organization’s success. An employee can directly affect the productivity of any organization. Hence, retention of the employees becomes great challenge for every organization. Artificial Intelligence is extensively used in such cases to analyze the problem behind a company's low retention rate of valuable employees. The analysis can help organizations to build up strategies to deal with the problems of employees leaving an organization. The current work aims to detect key features or main reasons behind an employee's key decision to stay or leave the organization. Primarily in this work machine learning is used extensively to create a create a prediction model on the collected data from human resources of different organization. In addition, the proposed framework uses explainable Artificial Intelligence methods such as SHAPley Additive exPlanations and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations to analyze the key factors behind employees leaving the organizations. The current work managed to accurately create a prediction model with a score of 96% and detect three key features behind employee’s decision of staying or leaving any organization. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Relation extraction for automated knowledge base construction typically requires much training data. If these are not available for a specific information need, relations must be extracted manually, or by hand-crafted extraction rules [Wu18]. Data Programming can be used to define heuristics that generate noisy labels for many instances, but this requires programming knowledge [Di19]. We present an approach to extract relations from multimodal documents using a few training data. Furthermore, we derive explanations in the form of extraction rules from the underlying model to ensure the reliability of the extraction. Finally, we will evaluate how reliable (high model fidelity) extracted rules are and which type of classifier is suitable in terms of F1 Score and explainability. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Transparent and explainable machine learning (ML) models are essential in various domains, e.g., energy consumption, where decarbonization is the main challenge. The European Union is focusing on energy efficiency retrofits in residential buildings to help reach its 2050 carbon emissions target. The cost of these investments is often a strong factor, requiring decision-makers to understand the motivations driving homeowners’ decisions to undertake energy retrofits. Instead of hedonic models commonly used in operational management research studies, we rely on ML methods to predict homeowners’ decisions to undertake energy retrofits, using data from 51,000 households in France. We describe the data preparation, model training, and evaluation; results show that artificial neural networks outperform other popular ML techniques (91.4%). Our post hoc method based on sensitivity analysis and feature importance contributes to the transparency and interpretability of the results. We show that the type of public aid used, head of household gender, family size, prior knowledge of aid, urban vs. rural area, geographical location, occupancy status, and working status are the most important factors in the decision to undertake energy efficiency retrofits. Our predictive methods help decision-makers to make optimal decisions about the level, type, beneficiaries of public incentives for energy retrofits, and expected outcomes; companies in the construction sector can understand homeowners’ key motivations and optimally calibrate their strategic investments and operations. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Deep-learning (DL) techniques have been proposed to solve geophysical seismic facies classification problems without introducing the subjectivity of human interpreters' decisions. However, such DL algorithms are 'black boxes' by nature, and the underlying basis can be hardly interpreted. Subjectivity is therefore often introduced during the quality control process, and any interpretation of DL models can become an important source of information. To provide a such degree of interpretation and retain a higher level of human intervention, the development and application of explainable DL methods have been explored. To showcase the usefulness of such methods in the field of geoscience, we utilize a prototype-based neural network (NN) for the seismic facies classification problem. The 'prototype' vectors, jointly learned to have the stereotypical qualities of a certain label, form a set of representative samples. The interpretable component thereby transforms 'black boxes' into 'gray boxes.' We demonstrate how prototypes can be used to explain NN methods by directly inspecting key functional components. We describe substantial explanations in three ways of examining: 1) prototypes' corresponding input-output pairs; 2) the values generated at the specific explainable layer; and 3) the numerical structure of specific shallow layers located between the interpretable latent prototype layer and an output layer. Most importantly, the series of interpretations shows how geophysical knowledge can be used to understand the actual function of the seismic facies classifier and therefore help the DL's quality control process. The method is applicable to many geoscientific classification problems when in-depth interpretations of NN classifiers are required. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The recent increase in computational capability has led to an unprecedented increase in the range of new applications where machine learning can be used in real time. Notwithstanding the range of use cases where automation is now feasible, humans are likely to retain a critical role in the operation and certification of manufacturing systems for the foreseeable future. This paper presents a use case review of how human operators affect the performance of cyber–physical systems within a ’smart’ or ’cognitive’ setting. Such applications are classified using Industry 4.0 (I4.0) or 5.0 (I5.0) terminology. The authors argue that, as there is often no general agreement as to when a specific use case moves from being an I4.0 to an I5.0 example, the use of a hybrid Industry X.0 notation at the intersection between I4.0 and I5.0 is warranted. Through a structured review of the literature, the focus is on how secure human-mediated autonomous production can be performed most effectively to augment and optimise machine operation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Digitization and automation have always had an immense impact on healthcare. It embraces every new and advanced technology. Recently the world has witnessed the prominence of the metaverse which is an emerging technology in digital space. The metaverse has huge potential to provide a plethora of health services seamlessly to patients and medical professionals with an immersive experience. This paper proposes the amalgamation of artificial intelligence and blockchain in the metaverse to provide better, faster, and more secure healthcare facilities in digital space with a realistic experience. Our proposed architecture can be summarized as follows. It consists of three environments, namely the doctor’s environment, the patient’s environment, and the metaverse environment. The doctors and patients interact in a metaverse environment assisted by blockchain technology which ensures the safety, security, and privacy of data. The metaverse environment is the main part of our proposed architecture. The doctors, patients, and nurses enter this environment by registering on the blockchain and they are represented by avatars in the metaverse environment. All the consultation activities between the doctor and the patient will be recorded and the data, i.e., images, speech, text, videos, clinical data, etc., will be gathered, transferred, and stored on the blockchain. These data are used for disease prediction and diagnosis by explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) models. The GradCAM and LIME approaches of XAI provide logical reasoning for the prediction of diseases and ensure trust, explainability, interpretability, and transparency regarding the diagnosis and prediction of diseases. Blockchain technology provides data security for patients while enabling transparency, traceability, and immutability regarding their data. These features of blockchain ensure trust among the patients regarding their data. Consequently, this proposed architecture ensures transparency and trust regarding both the diagnosis of diseases and the data security of the patient. We also explored the building block technologies of the metaverse. Furthermore, we also investigated the advantages and challenges of a metaverse in healthcare. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Motivation: Protein essentiality is usually accepted to be a conditional trait and strongly affected by cellular environments. However, existing computational methods often do not take such characteristics into account, preferring to incorporate all available data and train a general model for all cell lines. In addition, the lack of model interpretability limits further exploration and analysis of essential protein predictions. Results: In this study, we proposed DeepCellEss, a sequence-based interpretable deep learning framework for cell line-specific essential protein predictions. DeepCellEss utilizes a convolutional neural network and bidirectional long short-term memory to learn short- and long-range latent information from protein sequences. Further, a multi-head self-attention mechanism is used to provide residue-level model interpretability. For model construction, we collected extremely large-scale benchmark datasets across 323 cell lines. Extensive computational experiments demonstrate that DeepCellEss yields effective prediction performance for different cell lines and outperforms existing sequence-based methods as well as network-based centrality measures. Finally, we conducted some case studies to illustrate the necessity of considering specific cell lines and the superiority of DeepCellEss. We believe that DeepCellEss can serve as a useful tool for predicting essential proteins across different cell lines. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Machine learning approaches (ML) based on data-driven models are conducive to accelerating the assessments of the martensitic transformation peak temperature (T<inf>p</inf>) of TiZrHfNiCoCu high entropy shape memory alloys (HESMAs) over a huge composition space. In this work, an interpretable machine learning workflow was established through dataset construction, feature selection, modeling and validation, and model interpretation. We identified a set of key feature combinations closely related to T<inf>p</inf>, by exploiting Pearson correlation selection, univariate feature selection, and forward feature elimination. The established ML model was then used to estimate the T<inf>p</inf> of three newly synthesized alloys, with their prediction relative errors of less than 3 % in comparison with the experimental measurements. The behaviors of our ML model were interpreted by the Shapley Additive exPlainations (SHAP) approach, demonstrating the crucial role of CV22 (Allred Rochow electronegativity) in the prediction of T<inf>p</inf>. In addition, the ML model in combination with our designed interpretation strategy was further used to investigate the effects of alloying elements on the T<inf>p</inf>, which showed that the TiZrHfNiCoCu HESMAs with 9 ≦ Co (mol%) ≤ 10 and 15 ≦ Cu (mol%) ≤ 17 have pronounced positive effects on T<inf>p</inf>. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The use of AI algorithms to support public decisions is spreading in public administrations while with an asymmetrical speed it has already transformed the private sector. Substantial questions are still open about the algorithmic legality of AI choices. Deep neural networks do not allow full eXplainability of the decision-making process as the programmer himself does not have the ability to be aware of the logical steps taken to achieve the proposed goal. In these cases the question arises of the “AI black box” which collides with the rules of Italian administrative law which, on the contrary, seeks total transparency as a great metaphor for a “glass house” public administration and is oriented towards a shared administration with citizens. The objective of the paper is to explore the torsion points of algorithmic decision making towards the rules of the administrative procedure, bringing the algorithmic procedure back to a transparency in line with the European Commission's choice of an anthropocentric and transparent artificial intelligence by design that aims the improvement of the algorithm's eXplainability techniques (XAI). If refining XAI will be the key to a complete application of AI in the PA, this path, in order not to slow down the spread of AI and thus increase the gap to the detriment of the public sector, will have to be preceded by a logic of experimentation and incremental input: from the widespread automation of routine activities and administrative procedures with no margin of discretion to a gradual experimentation of AI solutions in complex use cases to support public decision-making through parallel analysis and verification processes. This approach can only be guaranteed through a joint work of jurists and computer scientists in the design of transparent algorithms by design, in the dogmatic construction of an Algorithmic Decision Making to respond to the principle of enhanced transparency required to guarantee the legitimacy of A.I. in administrative activity. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Decision support systems (DSS) assist in a wide array of decision-making tasks in different domains. However, one of their common drawbacks is that their working is back box in nature. This means that while they recommend a decision, they cannot explain the ’why’ behind reaching that decision. In prescriptive tasks such as risk management, this does not assist the risk manager in identifying the contributing features leading to the occurrence of a risk output against which corrective action/s needs to be taken. This limitation has sparked interest in explainability, where glass-box methods interpret the contributing features leading to the recommended decision. Approaches which do that however do not model how the contributing features’ evolve over a period of time, till the predicted time period, to determine the output class before interpreting the reason for the decision output. To address these gaps, in this work we propose An Automated Interpretable Artificial Intelligence framework for Proactive Risk Management (AIAI-PRM). AIAI-PRM augments Local Interpretation-Driven Abstract Bayesian Network (LINDA-BN) with Knowledge Graph to determine the inter dependencies among the features, model how they evolve over a period of time and interpret the contributing features leading to the recommended output. In the domain of risk management, we show how this knowledge can be used by the risk manager to determine those key features against which risk management strategies need to be developed. Finally, we compare the AIAI-PRM's output with that of the most commonly used XAI approaches, namely LIME and SHAP, to prove its superiority. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Externally bonding fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) to concrete structures is an effective way to enhance the mechanical performance of concrete structures. Many equations have been proposed to predict the interfacial bond strength for FRP-concrete structures but have limited accuracy due to the complexity of the bond behavior. This study proposes to formulate the FRP-concrete interfacial bond strength based on machine learning (ML) methods, which have emerged as a promising alternative to achieve high prediction accuracy in high-dimension problems. To this end, a database containing 1,375 FRP-concrete direct shear test specimens that failed due to interfacial debonding was established. The database was improved using an unsupervised isolation forest that identified and eliminated anomalous data, and was then used to train six ML models, namely artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machine, decision tree, gradient boosting decision tree, random forest, and XGboost algorithms, to predict the FRP-concrete interfacial bond strength. The ML predictive models showed higher accuracy than 16 existing equations in the literature. The XGBoost model showed the highest accuracy, and its coefficient of variation was 54% lower than the existing equation with the highest accuracy among those considered. The ANN model was used to perform a parametric study on the influencing parameters, and a new equation was generated to predict the interfacial bond strength, considering the key influencing parameters. The equation enables interpretation of the ML models. The study combines ML models and traditional physical models to achieve a novel, interpretable ML method for predicting FRP-concrete interfacial bond strength. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The recent emergence of advanced computing technologies has opened a world of possibilities for bridging virtual-physical spaces in the future of urban air mobility (UAM). Digital twin technology (DT) introduces a coupled virtual-physical asset system that evolves over time in their digital and physical state-spaces associated with the real-time exchange of observed data and control inputs for high-fidelity operational services in UAM, such as traffic management, or vehicle maintenance. On the other hand, edge computing has been envisioned as a dominant computing paradigm in future UAM infrastructures to enable infinitesimal-latency processing of massive and heterogeneous data acquired from ubiquitous devices and vehicles. Furthermore, federated learning (FL) has recently been proposed to resolve the performance and security problems of traditional AI techniques featured by centralized data collection and training to offer a decentralized and cooperative data training pattern among a huge number of devices/vehicles (aka., agents) in multi agent DT systems for UAM. Lastly, the blockchain has emerged as a ledger technology in which data and processes are divided into tiny data blocks and concatenated into a series to reinforce the security and scalability of decentralized computing patterns. Realizing the advances and integration of the emerging technologies mentioned above is of paramount importance for the development of DT systems in UAM. Previous studies have not completely considered the integration and harmony of these existing technologies for the development of UAM DT systems. There has also been a significant lack in comprehension and integration of emerging technologies for the development of UAM-DT systems. In that context, this study proposes a comprehensive integrated UAM-DT platform and solution of FL with the blockchain in edge computing for the development of UAM-DT systems, called BlockFE-DT. First, we introduce the adoption of a probabilistic graphical model as a formal mathematical foundation of coupled digital-physical twin systems for UAM, particularly for unmanned aircrafts. Afterwards, we review the fundamental concepts of FL, blockchain, and edge computing technologies to explore and propose an integration framework of FL with the blockchain in edge computing in the context of UAM-DT systems. Key issues in the integration are assimilated including explainable AI, dependability, and security. This work provides ground-breaking concepts and architectures for a blockchain empowered FL framework with edge computing in future UAM-DT systems. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The conical pick is the most essential tool of excavation machinery such as roadheaders, continuous miners, and shearers for breaking rock in mining and civil engineering operations. For rock cuttability, however, the geometry of conical picks and mechanical parameters of rocks are the most important factors. This study aims to construct an optimized data-driven predictive model to establish a quantitative correlation between strength of rock, geometry of tool, and cutting action data with the mean cutting force (CF). For this purpose, 157 datasets of 47 different materials including rocks, ores, coals, and artificial rocks with uniaxial compressive strength (σ<inf>c</inf>), tensile strength (σ<inf>t</inf>), cone angle (θ), attack angle (γ), cutting depth (d), and mean CF (MCF) are accumulated from the literature. Then, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model is constructed by fine-tuning hyperparameters using grid search, random search, genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and differential evolution (DE). Based on performance indices that are calculated for each model, i.e., coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAE) for the best performed model, i.e., DE-XGboost are R2= 0.812 , RMSE = 2256.90 N, and MAE = 1313.66 N for training stage and R2= 0.875 , RMSE = 2104.86 N, and MAE = 1140.42 N for testing stage, respectively. The findings also suggest that using a metaheuristic algorithm to fine-tune the hyperparameters of the XGBoost model can increase prediction accuracy. In the last step, three model interpretation methods viz., the permutation-based variable importance, H-statistic-based variable interaction, and accumulated local effects are applied to sensitivity analysis of the input parameters to predict MCF, providing key insights to model and researchers. The ALE plot demonstrated a complex non-linear relationship between predictors and the response variable. It is revealed that parameters d and θ have the highest and lowest impact on the MCF, respectively. Finally, the successful implementation of this approach provides a solid platform for future studies and can be an alternative to complicated conventional and theoretical methods. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The spreading of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods in different and critical application domains, like medicine and healthcare, introduces many opportunities but raises risks and opens ethical issues, mainly attaining to the lack of transparency. This contribution deals with the lack of transparency of ML and DL models focusing on the lack of trust in predictions and decisions generated. In this sense, this paper establishes a measure, namely Congruity, to provide information about the reliability of ML/DL model results. Congruity is defined by the lattice extracted through the formal concept analysis built on the training data. It measures how much the incoming data items are close to the ones used at the training stage of the ML and DL models. The general idea is that the reliability of trained model results is highly correlated with the similarity of input data and the training set. The objective of the paper is to demonstrate the correlation between the Congruity and the well-known Accuracy of the whole ML/DL model. Experimental results reveal that the value of correlation between Congruity and Accuracy of ML model is greater than 80% by varying ML models. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Compressive strength is an important mechanical index that determines the mixture design of geopolymer, and its accurate prediction is essential. The existing experiment-based and statistical methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive and inaccurate. This study aims to develop an effective, reliable and interpretable machine learning (ML) model for predicting the compressive strength of calcium-based geopolymers. Feature engineering was constructed with molar ratios of raw material oxide composition, curing system, and mixing design. A total of eight algorithms in three types, traditional ML algorithms, integrated tree-based ML algorithms, and deep neural network algorithm, were employed to predict the compressive strength, and their differences, advantages, and disadvantages were compared. The importance of input variables in model training was evaluated. The contribution and influence pattern of input features on the development of compressive strength were revealed using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and inverse prediction. The results demonstrate that among the eight models proposed, the XGB model had the highest prediction accuracy (91%) and the lowest root mean squared error (3.85 MPa). Based on the importance analysis and the SHAP value, the parameters that had the greatest impact on the compressive strength were curing age, n(H<inf>2</inf>O)/n(Na<inf>2</inf>O), curing temperature, n(SiO<inf>2</inf>)/n(CaO) and the mass ratio of alkali activation solution to solid powder (L/S). The effects of input features on the compressive strength development of calcium-based geopolymers captured by SHAP and inverse predictions based on the best predictive model were consistent with the experimental results and theoretical understanding. The research in this paper facilitates the rapid prediction, improvement and optimization of the proportioning design and application of calcium-based geopolymers, and also provides a theoretical basis for the utilization of industrial and construction waste, in line with sustainable and low-carbon development strategies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) elastic gridshells consist of long continuous GFRP tubes that form elastic deformations. In this paper, a method for the form-finding of gridshell structures is presented based on the interpretable machine learning (ML) approaches. A comparative study is conducted on several ML algorithms, including support vector regression (SVR), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), AdaBoost, XGBoost, category boosting (CatBoost), and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM). A numerical example is presented using a standard double-hump gridshell considering two characteristics of deformation as objective functions. The combination of the grid search approach and k-fold cross-validation (CV) is implemented for fine-tuning the parameters of ML models. The results of the comparative study indicate that the LightGBM model presents the highest prediction accuracy. Finally, interpretable ML approaches, including Shapely additive explanations (SHAP), partial dependence plot (PDP), and accumulated local effects (ALE), are applied to explain the predictions of the ML model since it is essential to understand the effect of various values of input parameters on objective functions. As a result of interpretability approaches, an optimum gridshell structure is obtained and new opportunities are verified for form-finding investigation of GFRP elastic gridshells during lifting construction. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) models allow for a more transparent and understandable relationship between humans and machines. The insurance industry represents a fundamental opportunity to demonstrate the potential of XAI, with the industry’s vast stores of sensitive data on policyholders and centrality in societal progress and innovation. This paper analyses current Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications in insurance industry practices and insurance research to assess their degree of explainability. Using search terms representative of (X)AI applications in insurance, 419 original research articles were screened from IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Scopus, Web of Science and Business Source Complete and EconLit. The resulting 103 articles (between the years 2000–2021) representing the current state-of-the-art of XAI in insurance literature are analysed and classified, highlighting the prevalence of XAI methods at the various stages of the insurance value chain. The study finds that XAI methods are particularly prevalent in claims management, underwriting and actuarial pricing practices. Simplification methods, called knowledge distillation and rule extraction, are identified as the primary XAI technique used within the insurance value chain. This is important as the combination of large models to create a smaller, more manageable model with distinct association rules aids in building XAI models which are regularly understandable. XAI is an important evolution of AI to ensure trust, transparency and moral values are embedded within the system’s ecosystem. The assessment of these XAI foci in the context of the insurance industry proves a worthwhile exploration into the unique advantages of XAI, highlighting to industry professionals, regulators and XAI developers where particular focus should be directed in the further development of XAI. This is the first study to analyse XAI’s current applications within the insurance industry, while simultaneously contributing to the interdisciplinary understanding of applied XAI. Advancing the literature on adequate XAI definitions, the authors propose an adapted definition of XAI informed by the systematic review of XAI literature in insurance. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Recent approaches to Explainable AI (XAI) promise to satisfy diverse user expectations by allowing them to steer the interaction in order to elicit content relevant to them. However, little is known about how and to what extent the explainee takes part actively in the process of explaining. To tackle this empirical gap, we exploratively examined naturally occurring everyday explanations in doctor–patient interactions (N = 11). Following the social design of XAI, we view explanations as emerging in interactions: first, we identified the verbal behavior of both the explainer and the explainee in the sequential context, which we could assign to phases that were either monological or dialogical; second, we investigated in particular who was responsible for the initiation of the different phases. Finally, we took a closer look at the global conversational structure of explanations by applying a context-sensitive model of organizational jobs, thus adding a third layer of analysis. Results show that in our small sample of conversational explanations, both monological and dialogical phases varied in their length, timing of occurrence (at the early or later stages of the interaction) and their initiation (by the explainer or the explainee). They alternated several times in the course of the interaction. However, we also found some patterns suggesting that all interactions started with a monological phase initiated by the explainer. Both conversational partners contributed to the core organizational job that constitutes an explanation. We interpret the results as an indication for naturally occurring everyday explanations in doctor–patient interactions to be co-constructed on three levels of linguistic description: (1) by switching back and forth between monological to dialogical phases that (2) can be initiated by both partners and (3) by the mutual accomplishment and thus responsibility for an explanation’s core job that is crucial for the success of the explanation. Because of the explorative nature of our study, these results need to be investigated (a) with a larger sample and (b) in other contexts. However, our results suggest that future designs of artificial explainable systems should design the explanatory dialogue in such a way that it includes monological and dialogical phases that can be initiated not only by the explainer but also by the explainee, as both contribute to the core job of explicating procedural, clausal, or conceptual relations in explanations. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The layout design of analog integrated circuits has been defying all automation attempts, and it is still primarily a handcrafting process carried by circuit designers on traditional layout editing frameworks. This paper presents a toolbox based on deep learning techniques and a sturdy graphical user interface to assist designers during that process. The underlying mechanism of this toolbox relies on a simple pairwise device interaction circuit description, i.e., the circuits’ topological constraints, to propose valid floorplan solutions for block-level structures, including topologies and deep nanometer technology nodes not used for its training, at push-button speed. Despite its automatic functionalities, the toolbox is focused on explainable artificial intelligence, involving the designer in the synthesis flow via filtering and editing options over the candidate floorplan solutions. This constant state of human-machine feedback environment turns the designer aware of the impact of each device’s position change and inherent tradeoffs while suggesting subsequent moves, ultimately increasing the designers’ productivity in this time-consuming and iterative task. Finally, the toolbox is shown to instantly generate floorplans with similar or better constraint fulfilment than human designed solutions for state-of-the-art analog circuit blocks. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The growing complexity of software systems and the influence of software-supported decisions in our society sparked the need for software that is transparent, accountable, and trustworthy. Explainability has been identified as a means to achieve these qualities. It is recognized as an emerging non-functional requirement (NFR) that has a significant impact on system quality. Accordingly, software engineers need means to assist them in incorporating this NFR into systems. This requires an early analysis of the benefits and possible design issues that arise from interrelationships between different quality aspects. However, explainability is currently under-researched in the domain of requirements engineering, and there is a lack of artifacts that support the requirements engineering process and system design. In this work, we remedy this deficit by proposing four artifacts: a definition of explainability, a conceptual model, a knowledge catalogue, and a reference model for explainable systems. These artifacts should support software and requirements engineers in understanding the definition of explainability and how it interacts with other quality aspects. Besides that, they may be considered a starting point to provide practical value in the refinement of explainability from high-level requirements to concrete design choices, as well as on the identification of methods and metrics for the evaluation of the implemented requirements. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: In this work, we developed many machine learning classifiers to assist in diagnosing respiratory changes associated with sarcoidosis, based on results from the Forced Oscillation Technique (FOT), a non-invasive method used to assess pulmonary mechanics. In addition to accurate results, there is a particular interest in their interpretability and explainability, so we used Genetic Programming since the classification is made with intelligible expressions and we also evaluate the feature importance in different experiments to find the more discriminative features. Methodology/principal findings: We used genetic programming in its traditional tree form and a grammar-based form. To check if interpretable results are competitive, we compared their performance to K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, AdaBoost, Random Forest, LightGBM, XGBoost, Decision Trees and Logistic Regressor. We also performed experiments with fuzzy features and tested a feature selection technique to bring even more interpretability. The data used to feed the classifiers come from the FOT exams in 72 individuals, of which 25 were healthy, and 47 were diagnosed with sarcoidosis. Among the latter, 24 showed normal conditions by spirometry, and 23 showed respiratory changes. The results achieved high accuracy (AUC > 0.90) in two analyses performed (controls vs. individuals with sarcoidosis and normal spirometry and controls vs. individuals with sarcoidosis and altered spirometry). Genetic Programming and Grammatical Evolution were particularly beneficial because they provide intelligible expressions to make the classification. The observation of which features were selected most frequently also brought explainability to the study of sarcoidosis. Conclusions: The proposed system may provide decision support for clinicians when they are struggling to give a confirmed clinical diagnosis. Clinicians may reference the prediction results and make better decisions, improving the productivity of pulmonary function services by AI-assisted workflow. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The in-depth understanding of the relationship between development patterns of carsharing stations and built environment are important to the comprehensive station evaluation, layout optimization and urban spatial resources planning. However, the previous researches mainly study the operation of carsharing by aggregate methods with cross-sectional data and rarely discovered patterns within carsharing operation time series. Therefore, an interpretable analytic framework is proposed for predicting development patterns of carsharing stations, which is composed of a development pattern construction method based on Time Series Clustering and an interpretable prediction method based on CatBoost and SHAP models. The temporal variations of time series data are sufficiently utilized by time series clustering to identify patterns and CatBoost-SHAP has better classification performance and interpretability than general machine learning methods. The proposed framework is applied to explore the relationship between the development pattern of one-way carsharing stations and the built environment influencing factors. The result shows that the carsharing stations of Nanjing EVCARD are divided into two types: increasing pattern and decreasing pattern. The built environment factors that have the greatest impact on model output and the impact of pairwise factors are visually analysed. Moreover, this is also effective for a specific individual station to analyze the causes of its status quo. Therefore, this study provides data-driven intuitive decision references for carsharing operators, which helps the operators effectively manage carsharing stations. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: Surgical skill assessment has received growing interest in surgery training and quality control due to its essential role in competency assessment and trainee feedback. However, the current assessment methods rarely provide corresponding feedback guidance while giving ability evaluation. We aim to validate an explainable surgical skill assessment method that automatically evaluates the trainee performance of liposuction surgery and provides visual postoperative and real-time feedback. Methods: In this study, machine learning using a model-agnostic interpretable method based on stroke segmentation was introduced to objectively evaluate surgical skills. We evaluated the method on liposuction surgery datasets that consisted of motion and force data for classification tasks. Results: Our classifier achieved optimistic accuracy in clinical and imitation liposuction surgery models, ranging from 89 to 94%. With the help of SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), we deeply explore the potential rules of liposuction operation between surgeons with variant experiences and provide real-time feedback based on the ML model to surgeons with undesirable skills. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the strong abilities of explainable machine learning methods in objective surgical skill assessment. We believe that the machine learning model based on interpretive methods proposed in this article can improve the evaluation and training of liposuction surgery and provide objective assessment and training guidance for other surgeries. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - To understand the black-box characteristics of deep networks, counterfactual explanation that deduces not only the important features of an input space but also how those features should be modified to classify input as a target class has gained an increasing interest. The patterns that deep networks have learned from a training dataset can be grasped by observing the feature variation among various classes. However, current approaches perform the feature modification to increase the classification probability for the target class irrespective of the internal characteristics of deep networks. This often leads to unclear explanations that deviate from real-world data distributions. To address this problem, we propose a counterfactual explanation method that exploits the statistics learned from a training dataset. Especially, we gradually construct an explanation by iterating over masking and composition steps. The masking step aims to select an important feature from the input data to be classified as a target class. Meanwhile, the composition step aims to optimize the previously selected feature by ensuring that its output score is close to the logit space of the training data that are classified as the target class. Experimental results show that our method produces human-friendly interpretations on various classification datasets and verify that such interpretations can be achieved with fewer feature modification. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a standard digital process that fuses buildings information from different sources into a 3D model during their lifecycle. For new construction sites using BIM, it is possible to monitor the cost, schedule, and changes throughout the lifecycle; however, existing buildings do not have a BIM model. Manually creating the BIM models for existing buildings is a high-cost task, both in time and money, hence there is a need for extracting information from available paper-based documentation and fuse it into a BIM model. The struggle of facility management and utility companies to fully adopt a BIM process (due to their high volumes of paper-based documentation of existing buildings) has led to the research on creating these 3D BIM models from 2D floor plan images. This paper presents a novel processing pipeline to extract 2D digital information from floorplans, fusing it into a 3D BIM model. The work focuses on fusing the available information to create the structure of the building in BIM format, which is considered the essential step before looking on working with other sources of data. In this process, we introduce a type-2 fuzzy logic based Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) approach for the semantic segmentation step. The approach consists of using the outputs of type-2 fuzzy logic systems to classify a pixel as wall or background, by using information around and from the pixel of interest as the inputs to the system. After the semantic segmentation step, the output of the type-2 fuzzy logic goes through a noise removal process and finally a transformation from 2D to 3D by assigning the corresponding BIM tag to each identified element. The proposed type-2 fuzzy logic semantic segmentation approach produced comparable results (97.3% mean Intersection over Union (IoU) performance metric value) to the opaque box model approach based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) (99.3% mean IoU performance metric value). However, the type-2 fuzzy XAI system benefits from being an augmentable and interpretable model, which means that human users can understand the decision process and modify the model using their expert knowledge. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This article proposes a human posture classification system to classify the four postures of standing, bending, sitting, and lying using three-dimensional (3-D) fuzzy body voxel features obtained from two cameras and hierarchical fuzzy classifiers (FCs). The system consists of four parts: human body segmentation, 3-D body voxel model construction, feature extraction, and classification. A region-dependent Gaussian mixture model with shadow removal is proposed for human body segmentation. The silhouette volume intersection method with computation speedup is then used to construct the 3-D body model using the segmented images from two cameras. After that, fuzzy 3-D body voxel features for posture classification are extracted from a minimum enclosed cube of the 3-D model. For classification, this article proposes an FC with soft margin minimization (FC-SMM) and its hierarchical structure to improve the classification performance. The consequent and antecedent parameters are optimized through a linear batch support vector machine and margin selective gradient descent algorithm, respectively. The FC-SMM also shows the advantage of model interpretability through visualization of the fuzzy rules. Experimental results of the comparison of different feature extraction methods and classifiers in different videos show the superiority of the proposed classification method. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Concrete-filled steel tubular (CFST) columns have been popular in the construction industry due to enhanced mechanical properties such as higher strength and ductility, higher seismic resistance, and aesthetics. Extensive experimental, numerical and analytical studies have been conducted in the past few decades to assess the structural response of CFST columns under various loading conditions. However, there is still uncertainty in predicting the capacity of CFST columns, and most of the current codes are conservative. In this paper, data-driven machine learning (ML) models have been developed to predict the axial compression capacity of rectangular CFST columns. An extensive database of 719 experiments was collected from literature and is randomly used to train, test, and validate the ML models. Seven ML models, namely lasso regression, random forest, Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Categorical Gradient Boosting (CatBoost), are evaluated to predict the compression capacity of CFST stub columns under axial load. The performance of the different ML models in predicting the compressive strength of CFST columns is compared by different code equations prevalent in different parts of the world. It is found that LightGBM and CatBoost models performed better with an accuracy of 97.9% and 98.3%, respectively, compared to the existing design codes in predicting the capacity of CFST columns. Feature importance analyses and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) explain the ML model performances and make the developed models interpretable. Resistance factor is determined using the best performing ML model for compressive strength prediction of CFST stub columns following AISC 360–16 code provision. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In the past decade, Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) achieved the state-of-the-art performance in computer vision tasks. However, DCNN is usually treated as a “black box”, whose internal working principle is hard to understand. This drawback significantly limits its usage in real-world applications, e.g., vision-based Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), where wrong predictions may lead to catastrophic consequences. To resolve this problem, a framework for the interpretation of the Deep Learning (DL) results called Structural Image Guided Map Analysis Box (SIGMA-Box or Σ-Box) is proposed. In the Σ-Box, visual interpretation results (saliency maps) are produced and used for model quality evaluation along with human experts’ domain knowledge. In this study, the use of the Σ-Box is explored in vision-based SHM applications. Firstly, understanding trained DCNN's performance in concrete cover spalling detection is investigated. Besides, learning procedure at different epochs, learned feature from different network depths, influence of training techniques, and level of semantic abstraction are studied. The experiments demonstrate the good interpretable performance of the Σ-Box which facilitates the understanding of the DCNN models’ recognition capabilities, preferences, and limitations. In conclusion, this study sheds light on the high potential of interpreting the trained DCNN in vision-based SHM, providing confidence to the engineers for practical engineering applications involving DL. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Deep neural network models have substantial advantages over traditional and machine learning methods that make this class of models particularly promising for adoption by actuaries. Nonetheless, several important aspects of these models have not yet been studied in detail in the actuarial literature: the effect of hyperparameter choice on the accuracy and stability of network predictions, methods for producing uncertainty estimates and the design of deep learning models for explainability. To allow actuaries to incorporate deep learning safely into their toolkits, we review these areas in the context of a deep neural network for forecasting mortality rates. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The continuous advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been revolutionizing the strategy of decision-making in different life domains. Regardless of this achievement, AI algorithms have been built as Black-Boxes, that is as they hide their internal rationality and learning methodology from the human leaving many unanswered questions about how and why the AI decisions are made. The absence of explanation results in a sensible and ethical challenge. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is an evolving subfield of AI that emphasizes developing a plethora of tools and techniques for unboxing the Black-Box AI solutions by generating human-comprehensible, insightful, and transparent explanations of AI decisions. This study begins by discussing the primary principles of XAI research, Black-Box problems, the targeted audience, and the related notion of explainability over the historical timeline of the XAI studies and accordingly establishes an innovative definition of explainability that addresses the earlier theoretical proposals. According to an extensive analysis of the literature, this study contributes to the body of knowledge by driving a fine-grained, multi-level, and multi-dimension taxonomy for insightful categorization of XAI studies with the main aim to shed light on the variations and commonalities of existing algorithms paving the way for extra methodological developments. Then, an experimental comparative analysis is presented for the explanation generated by common XAI algorithms applied to different categories of data to highlight their properties, advantages, and flaws. Followingly, this study discusses and categorizes the evaluation metrics for the XAI-generated explanation and the findings show that there is no common consensus on how an explanation must be expressed, and how its quality and dependability should be evaluated. The findings show that XAI can contribute to realizing responsible and trustworthy AI, however, the advantages of interpretability should be technically demonstrated, and complementary procedures and regulations are required to give actionable information that can empower decision-making in real-world applications. Finally, the tutorial is crowned by discussing the open research questions, challenges, and future directions that serve as a roadmap for the AI community to advance the research in XAI and to inspire specialists and practitioners to take the advantage of XAI in different disciplines. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Measuring perceptions of visual walkability in urban streets and exploring the associations between the visual features of the street built environment that make walking attractive to humans are both theoretically and practically important. Previous studies have used either environmental audits and subjective evaluations that have limitations in terms of cost, time, and measurement scale, or computer-aided audits based on natural street view images (SVIs) but with gaps in real perception. In this study, a virtual reality panoramic image-based deep learning framework is proposed for measuring visual walkability perception (VWP) and then quantifying and visualizing the contributing visual features. A VWP classification deep multitask learning (VWPCL) model was first developed and trained on human ratings of panoramic SVIs in virtual reality to predict VWP in six categories. Second, a regression model was used to determine the degree of correlation of various objects with one of the six VWP categories based on semantic segmentation. Furthermore, an interpretable deep learning model was used to assist in identifying and visualizing elements that contribute to VWP. The experiment validated the accuracy of the VWPCL model for predicting VWP. The results represent a further step in understanding the interplay of VWP and street-level semantics and features. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - During the learning process, a child develops a mental representation of the task he or she is learning. A Machine Learning algorithm develops also a latent representation of the task it learns. We investigate the development of the knowledge construction of an artificial agent through the analysis of its behavior, i.e., its sequences of moves while learning to perform the Tower of Hanoï (TOH) task. The TOH is a well-known task in experimental contexts to study the problem-solving processes and one of the fundamental processes of children's knowledge construction about their world. We position ourselves in the field of explainable reinforcement learning for developmental robotics, at the crossroads of cognitive modeling and explainable AI. Our main contribution proposes a 3-step methodology named Implicit Knowledge Extraction with eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (IKE-XAI) to extract the implicit knowledge, in form of an automaton, encoded by an artificial agent during its learning. We showcase this technique to solve and explain the TOH task when researchers have only access to moves that represent observational behavior as in human–machine interaction. Therefore, to extract the agent acquired knowledge at different stages of its training, our approach combines: first, a Q-learning agent that learns to perform the TOH task; second, a trained recurrent neural network that encodes an implicit representation of the TOH task; and third, an XAI process using a post-hoc implicit rule extraction algorithm to extract finite state automata. We propose using graph representations as visual and explicit explanations of the behavior of the Q-learning agent. Our experiments show that the IKE-XAI approach helps understanding the development of the Q-learning agent behavior by providing a global explanation of its knowledge evolution during learning. IKE-XAI also allows researchers to identify the agent's Aha! moment by determining from what moment the knowledge representation stabilizes and the agent no longer learns. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, a novel method for selecting the optimal data augmentation method in combination with explainable artificial intelligence techniques is presented. Accordingly, a convolutional neural network-based model was designed to quantitatively evaluate the affective sound quality characteristics of vehicle driving sounds, which were classified as professional knowledge. Virtual learning data were created by adjusting the color of the image to avoid damaging the physical features of the spectrogram. By implementing the explainable artificial intelligence technique, the spectrogram features were extracted using domain knowledge. In particular, the engine noise of the vehicle, which plays a significant role in determining the characteristics of the running sound of the vehicle, was selected as a physical characteristic called the engine order line in the spectrogram. The explainable artificial intelligence technique was used to select the most influential feature among those extracted from the spectrogram. By observing the changes in the selected characteristics according to the data augmentation method, an optimal data augmentation method is proposed according to each characteristic. Furthermore, an average classification accuracy of 94.22% was obtained using the proposed data augmentation method, which is an improvement of 1.55–5.55% over the existing data augmentation methods. Moreover, according to the dataset, the standard deviation of the classification accuracy was 2.13%, which yielded an optimum result. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In last mile delivery, to manage delivery default risks and ensure delivery completion, reserve personenel are placed. This is due to driver procurement having to be planned and executed about one-month ahead, when delivery demands could only be roughly predicted. Although reserve drivers occasionally work as final defense, it regularly lowers driver utility, and a method to place reserve drivers balancing delivery default risk and driver utility is required. Previous work tackled this problem by stochastic staffing problem approaches, but there existed a limit in feature modelling and result interpretability, which created a gap in algorithms and procurement manager decision making. The proposed method aims to fill this gap, by taking a transdisciplinary approach of traditional scheduling, probability modelling, and explainable AI. In doing so, a flow of first creating a staffing schedule based on fixed staffing number demands, and then determining a fixed number of reserve personnel required for each staffing window, was designed. A probablity distribution of required personnel number per delivery is calculated in doing so, and this distribution is used as a easy to understand decision support tool for delivery managers. Through a case study using delivery demand data of a Japanese EC-logistics company, the proposed method was shown capable of lowering reserve drivers, with having a high potential of no delivery defaults. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Explanation methods highlight the importance of the input features in taking a predictive decision, and represent a solution to increase the transparency and trustworthiness in machine learning and deep neural networks (DNNs). However, explanation methods can be easily manipulated generating misleading explanations particularly under visually imperceptible adversarial perturbations. Recent work has identified the decision surface geometry of DNNs as the main cause of this phenomenon. To make explanation methods more robust against adversarially crafted perturbations, recent research has promoted several smoothing approaches. These approaches smooth either the explanation map or the decision surface. In this work, we initiate a very thorough evaluation of the quality and robustness of the explanations offered by smoothing approaches. Different properties are evaluated. We present settings in which the smoothed explanations are both better, and worse, than the explanations derived by the commonly-used (non-smoothed) Gradient explanation method. By making the connection with the literature on adversarial attacks, we demonstrate that such smoothed explanations are robust primarily against additive attacks. However, a combination of additive and non-additive attacks can still manipulate these explanations, revealing important shortcomings in their robustness properties. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A large number of XAI (eXplainable Artificial Intelligence) solutions have been proposed in recent years. Recently, thanks to new XAI evaluation metrics, it has become possible to compare these XAI solutions. However, selecting the most relevant XAI solution among all this diversity is still a tedious task, especially if a user has specific needs and constraints. In this paper, we propose AutoXAI, a framework that recommends the best XAI solution and its hyperparameters according to specified XAI evaluation metrics while considering the user's context (dataset, machine learning model, XAI needs and constraints). It adapts approaches from context-aware recommender systems on one side and strategies of optimization and evaluation from AutoML (Automated Machine Learning) on the other. Through two use cases, we show that AutoXAI recommends XAI solutions adapted to the user's needs with the best hyperparameters matching the user's constraints. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Abstract: The paper deals with the construction of interpretable machine learning models. Theapproximation problem is solved for a set of shapes on a contour image. Assumptions that theshapes are second-order curves are introduced. When approximating the shapes, informationabout the type, location, and shape of curves as well as about the set of their possibletransformations is used. Such information is called expert information, and the machine learning method based onexpert information is called expert-augmented learning.It is assumed that the set of shapes is approximated by the set of local models. Each local model based on expert informationapproximates one shape on the contour image. To construct the models, it is proposed to mapsecond-order curves into a feature space in which each local model is linear. Thus, second-ordercurves are approximated by a set of linear models. In a computational experiment, the problem ofapproximating an iris on a contour image is considered. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Human ideas and sentiments are mirrored in facial expressions. They give the spectator a plethora of social cues, such as the viewer’s focus of attention, intention, motivation, and mood, which can help develop better interactive solutions in online platforms. This could be helpful for children while teaching them, which could help in cultivating a better interactive connect between teachers and students, since there is an increasing trend toward the online education platform due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To solve this, the authors proposed kids’ emotion recognition based on visual cues in this research with a justified reasoning model of explainable AI. The authors used two datasets to work on this problem; the first is the LIRIS Children Spontaneous Facial Expression Video Database, and the second is an author-created novel dataset of emotions displayed by children aged 7 to 10. The authors identified that the LIRIS dataset has achieved only 75% accuracy, and no study has worked further on this dataset in which the authors have achieved the highest accuracy of 89.31% and, in the authors’ dataset, an accuracy of 90.98%. The authors also realized that the face construction of children and adults is different, and the way children show emotions is very different and does not always follow the same way of facial expression for a specific emotion as compared with adults. Hence, the authors used 3D 468 landmark points and created two separate versions of the dataset from the original selected datasets, which are LIRIS-Mesh and Authors-Mesh. In total, all four types of datasets were used, namely LIRIS, the authors’ dataset, LIRIS-Mesh, and Authors-Mesh, and a comparative analysis was performed by using seven different CNN models. The authors not only compared all dataset types used on different CNN models but also explained for every type of CNN used on every specific dataset type how test images are perceived by the deep-learning models by using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), which helps in localizing features contributing to particular emotions. The authors used three methods of XAI, namely Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and SoftGrad, which help users further establish the appropriate reason for emotion detection by knowing the contribution of its features in it. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Interactive machine learning (IML) enables the incorporation of human expertise because the human participates in the construction of the learned model. Moreover, with human-in-the-loop machine learning (HITL-ML), the human experts drive the learning, and they can steer the learning objective not only for accuracy but perhaps for characterisation and discrimination rules, where separating one class from others is the primary objective. Moreover, this interaction enables humans to explore and gain insights into the dataset as well as validate the learned models. Validation requires transparency and interpretable classifiers. The huge relevance of understandable classification has been recently emphasised for many applications under the banner of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). We use parallel coordinates to deploy an IML system that enables the visualisation of decision tree classifiers but also the generation of interpretable splits beyond parallel axis splits. Moreover, we show that characterisation and discrimination rules are also well communicated using parallel coordinates. In particular, we report results from the largest usability study of a IML system, confirming the merits of our approach. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The ability to monitor mental effort during a task using a wearable sensor may improve productivity for both work and study. The use of the electrodermal activity (EDA) signal for tracking mental effort is an emerging area of research. Through analysis of over 92 h of data collected with the Empatica E4 on a single participant across 91 different activities, we report on the efficacy of using EDA features getting at signal intensity, signal dispersion, and peak intensity for prediction of the participant’s self-reported mental effort. We implemented the logistic regression algorithm as an interpretable machine learning approach and found that features related to signal intensity and peak intensity were most useful for the prediction of whether the participant was in a self-reported high mental effort state; increased signal and peak intensity were indicative of high mental effort. When cross-validated by activity moderate predictive efficacy was achieved (AUC = 0.63, F1 = 0.63, precision = 0.64, recall = 0.63) which was significantly stronger than using the model bias alone. Predicting mental effort using physiological data is a complex problem, and our findings add to research from other contexts showing that EDA may be a promising physiological indicator to use for sensor-based self-monitoring of mental effort throughout the day. Integration of other physiological features related to heart rate, respiration, and circulation may be necessary to obtain more accurate predictions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Explainable Domain-Specific Artificial Intelligence for Bridge Engineering and Design. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) is currently being discussed and evaluated across the board in research and practice in all industries. This paper first provides the necessary background knowledge on general AI and then elaborates the necessity of developing domain-specific AI as well as explainable AI (XAI) for the calculation and design practice in civil engineering. The role of the civil engineering domain at the interface with AI in terms of data and modeling and design philosophy is discussed. The three examples of (i) computation of Kirchhoff slabs with physics-informed neural networks, (ii) calibration of prior models for parametric bridge design from databases, and (iii) AI-assisted conceptual design of bridges illustrate the application of domain-specific machine and deep learning and XAI with special focus on concrete and bridge design. In particular, physics-informed AI (piKI) represents an alternative to established numerical methods with special consideration of available simulation and experimental data and becomes explainable and comprehensible via the use of XAI. This paves the way for the use of piKI models in civil engineering as digital twins of a structure over its life cycles. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Municipalities are increasingly acknowledging the importance of urban form interventions that can reduce intra-city car travel in achieving more sustainable cities. Current academic knowledge for supporting such policies falls short in providing the spatial details required to plan specific interventions. Here, we develop an explainable machine learning framework to identify location-specific relevance of built environment for urban motorised travel, using a sample of 3.5 million car commutes over one year in Berlin and high-resolution urban form data. Results demonstrate that subcenters play a vital role in reducing commuting-related travel distance, giving support to the 15-minute city hypothesis. Observed threshold effects of induced CO<inf>2</inf> emissions require low-carbon-policies targeted towards densifying the inner city while releasing peripheral low income communities from car dependence. This research provides a starting point for increasingly rich big data analyses of urban form for creating low-carbon and inclusive urban planning strategies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Dimensionality reduction (DR) is a popular method for preparing and analyzing high-dimensional data. Reduced data representations are less computationally intensive and easier to manage and visualize, while retaining a significant percentage of their original information. Aside from these advantages, these reduced representations can be difficult or impossible to interpret in most circumstances, especially when the DR approach does not provide further information about which features of the original space led to their construction. This problem is addressed by Interpretable Machine Learning, a subfield of Explainable Artificial Intelligence that addresses the opacity of machine learning models. However, current research on Interpretable Machine Learning has been focused on supervised tasks, leaving unsupervised tasks like Dimensionality Reduction unexplored. In this paper, we introduce LXDR, a technique capable of providing local interpretations of the output of DR techniques. Experiment results and two LXDR use case examples are presented to evaluate its usefulness. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - We are concerned with the construction, formal verification, and safety assurance of dependable multiagent systems. For the case where the system (agents and their environment) can be explicitly modelled, we develop formal verification methods over several logic languages, such as temporal epistemic logic and strategy logic, to reason about the knowledge and strategy of the agents. For the case where the system cannot be explicitly modelled, we study multiagent deep reinforcement learning, aiming to develop efficient and scalable learning methods for cooperative multiagent tasks. In addition to these, we develop (both formal and simulation-based) verification methods for the neural network based perception agent that is trained with supervised learning, considering its safety and robustness against attacks from an adversarial agent, and other approaches (such as explainable AI, reliability assessment, and safety argument) for the analysis and assurance of the learning components. Our ultimate objective is to combine formal methods, machine learning, and reliability engineering to not only develop dependable learning-enabled multiagent systems but also provide rigorous methods for the verification and assurance of such systems. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This work develops a methodology for sensor placement and dynamic sensor scheduling decisions for digital twins. The digital twin data assimilation is posed as a classification problem, and predictive models are used to train optimal classification trees that represent the map from observed data to estimated digital twin states. In addition to providing a rapid digital twin updating capability, the resulting classification trees yield an interpretable mathematical representation that can be queried to inform sensor placement and sensor scheduling decisions. The proposed approach is demonstrated for a structural digital twin of a 12 ft wingspan unmanned aerial vehicle. Offline, training data are generated by simulating scenarios using predictive reduced-order models of the vehicle in a range of structural states. These training data can be further augmented using experimental or other historical data. In operation, the trained classifier is applied to observational data from the physical vehicle, enabling rapid adaptation of the digital twin in response to changes in structural health. Within this context, we study the performance of the optimal tree classifiers and demonstrate how they enable explainable structural assessments from sparse sensor measurements and also inform optimal sensor placement. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Recently, Telehealth connects patients to vital healthcare services via remote monitoring, wireless communications, videoconferencing, and electronic consults. By increasing access to specialists and physicians, telehealth assists in ensuring patients receive the proper care at the right time and right place. Teleophthalmology is a study of telemedicine that provides services for eye care using digital medical equipment and telecommunication technologies. Multimedia computing with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) for telehealth has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our society, but several technical challenges should be resolved before this potential can be realized. Advances in artificial intelligence methods and tools reduce waste and wait times, provide service efficiency and better insights, and increase speed, the level of accuracy, and productivity in medicine and telehealth. Therefore, this study develops an XAI-enabled teleophthalmology for diabetic retinopathy grading and classification (XAITO-DRGC) model. The proposed XAITO-DRGC model utilizes OphthoAI IoMT headsets to enable remote monitoring of diabetic retinopathy (DR) disease. To accomplish this, the XAITO-DRGC model applies median filtering (MF) and contrast enhancement as a pre-processing step. In addition, the XAITO-DRGC model applies U-Net-based image segmentation and SqueezeNet-based feature extractor. Moreover, Archimedes optimization algorithm (AOA) with a bidirectional gated recurrent convolutional unit (BGRCU) is exploited for DR detection and classification. The experimental validation of the XAITO-DRGC method can be tested using a benchmark dataset and the outcomes are assessed under distinct prospects. Extensive comparison studies stated the enhancements of the XAITO-DRGC model over recent approaches. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Credit risk management is an area where regulators expect banks to have transparent and auditable risk models, which would preclude the use of more accurate black-box models. Furthermore, the opaqueness of these models may hide unknown biases that may lead to unfair lending decisions. In this study, we show that banks do not have to sacrifice prediction accuracy at the cost of model transparency to be compliant with regulatory requirements. We illustrate this by showing that the predictions of credit losses given by a black-box model can be easily explained in terms of their inputs. Because black-box models are better at uncovering complex patterns in the data, banks should consider the determinants of credit losses suggested by these models in lending decisions and pricing of credit exposures. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Advanced machine learning techniques have recently demonstrated outstanding performance when applied to power quality disturbance (PQD) classification. Nevertheless, a possible problem is that power experts may find it hard to trust the results of such algorithms, if they do not fully understand the reasons for their outputs. In this light, this article suggests a method that explains the outputs of PQD classifiers, using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). The method operates as follows: first, various XAI techniques and classifiers are combined and scored based on their explanations during the validation step. Then, the best combination of classifier and XAI technique for each disturbance is used on the testing set, such that the classifier outputs are more transparent. To accomplish these steps, a definition for the correct explanation in PQD is given. Also, to determine the quality of an explanation for a certain output, we propose an evaluation process to measure the explainability score for each XAI technique and classifier. By means of this approach, the PQD classifier outputs are optimized to be both accurate and easy to understand, allowing experts to make informed and trustworthy decisions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study investigates the intensity of accidents by considering the lost workdays based on real data and derived the feature importance quantitatively. Occupational injuries lead to lost workdays for construction workers. The term “lost workdays” refers to a period in which workers cannot perform regular jobs because of severe physical or mental damage from occupational injuries. Many studies focusing on type analysis, accident prediction, and risk management of construction accidents, combined with the intensity and frequency of accidents, have been conducted to prevent and minimize accidents. However, the existing method for measuring the intensity of occupational accidents/injuries is a qualitative method that reflects experts’ opinions, mainly using brainstorming, the Delphi method, and the analytic hierarchy process. Thus, we propose a framework that combines traditional analysis and interpretable machine learning approaches. The random forest model was trained with 11,223 injured worker samples, feature importance and frequency analysis with the chi-squared test, and local interpretable model-agnostic data. According to the results of this study, optimal safety management is possible if appropriate resources are allocated. If the risk of accidents is measured with objective and quantitative data, the prevention and analysis of accidents can be more reliable, and resources can be more efficiently allocated. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The goals of emergency management are to restore human safety and security, and to help the authorities understand what causes such events. It requires information that is both highly accurate, and can be generated very quickly. This research addresses these concerns with a machine learning model based on cause-and-effect using a Bayesian belief network. This employs human critical thinking and amplified context to encode the model structures, which contribute towards its imitation of human-intelligent understanding, and the model parameters are fitted using social media data. The results show that our model is a natural fit for a real-world environment required emergency management. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - As post hoc explanation methods are increasingly being leveraged to explain complex models in high-stakes settings, it becomes critical to ensure that the quality of the resulting explanations is consistently high across all subgroups of a population. For instance, it should not be the case that explanations associated with instances belonging to, e.g., women, are less accurate than those associated with other genders. In this work, we initiate the study of identifying group-based disparities in explanation quality. To this end, we first outline several key properties that contribute to explanation quality-namely, fidelity (accuracy), stability, consistency, and sparsity-And discuss why and how disparities in these properties can be particularly problematic. We then propose an evaluation framework which can quantitatively measure disparities in the quality of explanations. Using this framework, we carry out an empirical analysis with three datasets, six post hoc explanation methods, and different model classes to understand if and when group-based disparities in explanation quality arise. Our results indicate that such disparities are more likely to occur when the models being explained are complex and non-linear. We also observe that certain post hoc explanation methods (e.g., Integrated Gradients, SHAP) are more likely to exhibit disparities. Our work sheds light on previously unexplored ways in which explanation methods may introduce unfairness in real world decision making. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The deck condition of bridges is one of the most important factors impacting the connectivity and efficiency of transportation networks. Bridges with quickly deteriorating deck conditions are a huge financial burden for transportation agencies and can downgrade the efficiency of the whole transportation network. This study utilizes an interpretable machine learning framework, Shapley additive explanation (SHAP), to investigate the associations between various factors, such as wearing surface, deck structure, and so forth, and bridges with quickly deteriorating deck conditions nationwide. An XGBoost model is trained to perform the binary classification task on a heavily imbalanced dataset and classify relatively young bridges (less than 20 years old) with poor/fair deck conditions and relatively old bridges (30–40 years old) with good deck conditions in the National Bridge Inventory (NBI) database. The accuracy of the predictive model is 0.91, and the AUC score is about 0.83. After applying this well-performed predictive model on the interpretable machine learning framework, the results revealed that without wearing surface, corrugated steel deck structure, wide bridge structure, and long span are highly associated with bridges with quickly deteriorating decks. The results also show that bridges with a relatively low average daily traffic (ADT) or truck percentage of ADT are in a dilemma zone, where the overall traffic or truck volume of the bridge is not low enough to prevent fast deterioration, but not high enough for eligibility for the funding required for more durable materials during construction or appropriate maintenance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper we introduce a research agenda to guide the development of the next generation of Discrete Event Simulation (DES) systems. Interfaces to digital twins are projected to go beyond physical representations to become blueprints for the actual “objects” and an active dashboard for their control. The role and importance of real-time interactive animations presented in an Extended Reality (XR) format will be explored. The need for using game engines, particularly their physics engines and AI within interactive simulated Extended Reality is expanded on. Importing and scanning real-world environments is assumed to become more efficient when using AR. Exporting to VR and AR is recommended to be a default feature. A technology framework for the next generation simulators is presented along with a proposed set of implementation guidelines. The need for more human centric technology approaches, nascent in Industry 4.0, are now central to the emerging Industry 5.0 paradigm; an agenda that is discussed in this research as part of a human in the loop future, supported by DES. The potential role of Explainable Artificial Intelligence is also explored along with an audit trail approach to provide a justification of complex and automated decision-making systems with relation to DES. A technology framework is proposed, which brings the above together and can serve as a guide for the next generation of holistic simulators for manufacturing. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Recently, interest in the Cyber-Physical System (CPS) has been increasing in the manufacturing industry environment. Various manufacturing intelligence studies are being conducted to enable faster decision-making through various reliable indicators collected from the manufacturing process. Artificial intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have advanced enough to give various possibilities of predicting manufacturing time, which can help implement CPS in manufacturing environments, but it is difficult to secure reliability because it is difficult to understand how AI works, and although it can offer good results, it is often not applied to industries. In this paper, Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BI-LSTM) is used to predict process execution time, which is an indicator that can be used as a basis for CPS in the manufacturing process, and the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) algorithm is used to explain how artificial intelligence works. The experimental results of this paper, applying manufacturing data, prove that the results derived from SHAP are effective for workers and AI to collaborate. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite the high accuracy offered by state-of-the-art deep natural-language models (e.g., LSTM, BERT), their application in real-life settings is still widely limited, as they behave like a black-box to the end-user. Hence, explainability is rapidly becoming a fundamental requirement of future-generation data-driven systems based on deep-learning approaches. Several attempts to fulfill the existing gap between accuracy and interpretability have been made. However, robust and specialized eXplainable Artificial Intelligence solutions, tailored to deep natural-language models, are still missing. We propose a new framework, named T-EBAnO, which provides innovative prediction-local and class-based model-global explanation strategies tailored to deep learning natural-language models. Given a deep NLP model and the textual input data, T-EBAnO provides an objective, human-readable, domain-specific assessment of the reasons behind the automatic decision-making process. Specifically, the framework extracts sets of interpretable features mining the inner knowledge of the model. Then, it quantifies the influence of each feature during the prediction process by exploiting the normalized Perturbation Influence Relation index at the local level and the novel Global Absolute Influence and Global Relative Influence indexes at the global level. The effectiveness and the quality of the local and global explanations obtained with T-EBAnO are proved on an extensive set of experiments addressing different tasks, such as a sentiment-analysis task performed by a fine-tuned BERT model and a toxic-comment classification task performed by an LSTM model. The quality of the explanations proposed by T-EBAnO, and, specifically, the correlation between the influence index and human judgment, has been evaluated by humans in a survey with more than 4000 judgments. To prove the generality of T-EBAnO and its model/task-independent methodology, experiments with other models (ALBERT, ULMFit) on popular public datasets (Ag News and Cola) are also discussed in detail. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - External stakeholders require accurate and explainable financial distress prediction (FDP) models. Complex machine learning algorithms offer high accuracy, but most of them lack explanatory power, resulting in external stakeholders being cautious in adopting them. Therefore, an explainable artificial intelligence approach including a whole process ensemble method and an explainable frame for FDP is here proposed. The ensemble algorithm from feature selection to predictor construction can achieve high accuracy according to the actual case, and the interpretation framework can meet the needs of external users by generating local explanations and global explanations. First, a two-stage scheme integrated with a filter and wrapper technique is designed for feature selection. Second, multiple ensemble models are explored and they are evaluated according to the actual case. Finally, Shapley additive explanations, counterfactual explanations and partial dependence plots are employed to enhance model interpretability. Taking financial data of Chinese listed companies from 2007 to 2020 as a dataset, the highest AUC is ensured by LightGBM with a value of 0.92. Local explanations help individual enterprises identify the key features which lead to their financial distress, and counterfactual explanations are produced to provide improvement strategies. By analyzing the features importance and the impact of feature interaction on the results, global explanations can improve the transparency and credibility of ‘black box’ models. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Continuous generating grinding plays an essential role in modern gear manufacturing, while the increasing need for high-quality gear products pushes the quality control of the grinding process. This paper proposed a vibration-based process monitoring method to classify faults generated during grinding processes. Gear grinding measurements have been conducted during experiments with different parameters of the feed rate, infeed, and gear eccentricity. The grinding vibration signals have been gathered to form a dataset with seven gear quality categories. A novel deep learning model is presented in this paper exploiting the power of Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD) and Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN). The WPD is adopted to transform the vibration signal into 2D time-frequency representations, used as inputs to the DCNN model for classification. Experimental results show that, the proposed DCNN can achieve a high classification accuracy of 95.83%, demonstrating the methodology's efficiency. In addition, this paper exploits the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Map (Grad-CAM) technique to interpret the deep neural network's decisions in order to facilitate the model deployment in industrial production. The Grad-CAM visualizations are utilized to show the activation regions on the spectrograms, which further indicate that the attentions of the DCNN have a strong correlation with the manufacturing parameters of different grinding passes. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper aims to improve the explainability of autoencoder (AE) predictions by proposing two novel explanation methods based on the mean and epistemic uncertainty of log-likelihood estimates, which naturally arise from the probabilistic formulation of the AE, the Bayesian autoencoder (BAE). These formulations contrast the conventional post-hoc explanation methods for AEs, which incur additional modelling effort and implementations. We further extend the methods for sensor-based explanations, aggregating the explanations at the sensor level instead of the lower feature level. To evaluate the performance of explanation methods quantitatively, we test them on condition monitoring applications. Due to the lack of a common assessment of explanation methods, especially under covariate shift, we propose three evaluation metrics: (1) the G-mean of Spearman drift coefficients, (2) the G-mean of sensitivity-specificity of explanation ranking and (3) a sensor explanation quality index (SEQI) which combines the first two metrics, capturing the explanations’ abilities to measure the degree of monotonicity and to rank the sensors. Surprisingly, we observe that the explanations of BAE's predictions suffer from high correlation resulting in misleading explanations. This new observation cautions against trusting these explanations without further understanding of when they may fail. To alleviate this, a “Coalitional BAE” is proposed, inspired by agent-based system theory. The Coalitional BAE models each sensor independently and eliminates the correlation in explanations. Our comprehensive experiments on publicly available condition monitoring datasets demonstrate significant improvements of the Coalitional BAEs over the baseline Centralised AEs on the proposed metrics, visualised through critical difference diagrams. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The construction of an accurate train control model (TCM) is crucial to the design of automatic train operation and real-time traffic management systems in high-speed railways. Traditional physical-driven models usually fail to reflect the “true” dynamics of high-speed trains (HSTs) because of the strong nonlinearity and uncertainty due to air resistance, frequently switching working conditions, and variations in external influencing factors such as weather and temperature. Although some data-driven deep learning models have recently been proposed for environmental adaptation, they are all “black-box” models, which cannot explain how the input of the models affects the HST output. To overcome these issues, this study constructs a novel long short-term memory with lagged information (LAG-LSTM) model by combining the physical-driven HST model and an “interpretable” deep learning model. Specifically, our LAG-LSTM model contains three modules: a time-delay variable module to model the transform delay of control variables, state variable enhancement module to extract the key features among high-dimensional input data, and Pre-LSTM module to predict the future train trajectory with given control variables. We collected field data from the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway and developed a data filter method and a normalization procedure to overcome the positioning errors of HSTs and construct a standard data set. Finally, we tested the effectiveness of our LAG-LSTM by comparing it with six deep learning structures, including fully connected neural network, recursive neural network, standard LSTM, and LSTM with convolutional layers. The results show that LAG-LSTM can accurately predict the trajectories of HSTs and outperforms other deep learning models. Regarding prediction accuracy, LAG-LSTM improved the performance of the traditional LSTM by 13.5% to 23.3%. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Collaborative robots (i.e., “cobots”) and machine learning-based virtual agents are increasingly entering the human workspace with the aim of increasing productivity, enhancing safety, and improving the quality of our lives. These agents will dynamically interact with a wide variety of people in dynamic and novel contexts, increasing the prevalence of human-machine teams in healthcare, manufacturing, and search-and-rescue. In this research, we enhance the mutual understanding within a human-machine team by enabling cobots to understand heterogeneous teammates via person-specific embeddings, identifying contexts in which xAI methods can help improve team mental model alignment, and enabling cobots to effectively communicate information that supports high-performance human-machine teaming. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

Previous studies have partially automated and standardized chart checking, but limited studies implement data-driven approaches to reduce cognitive workload for quality assurance processes. This study aims to evaluate feature selection methods to improve the interpretability and transparency of machine learning models in predicting the degree of difficulty for a pretreatment physics chart check. We compare chi-square, mutual information, feature importance thresholding, and greedy feature selection for four different classifiers. Random forest has the highest performance with SMOTE oversampling using mutual information for feature selection (accuracy 84.0%, AUC 87.0%, precision 80.0%, recall 80.0%). This study demonstrates that feature selection methods can improve model interpretability and transparency. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Automated parsing of design data will increasingly be a prerequisite for efficient data- and analytics-driven management of building portfolios. The high complexity and low rigidity of building information modelling (BIM) model exchange standards such as Industry Foundation Classes result in considerable differences in data quality and impede direct data availability for analytics-based decision support. Mis- or unclassified building elements are a common issue and can lead to tedious manual reworks. At the same time, scan-to-BIM processes still require considerable manual effort to identify subclass element geometry. This work leverages the benefits of a three-dimensional lightweight, geometric algorithm to generate meaningful geometric features autonomously that assist shape classification in erroneous design models and pre-segmented point clouds. Geometric deep learning is introduced in two steps; a discussion about the benefits of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) is given before a set of experiments on BIM element data sets is conducted. Utilising explainable artificial intelligence methods, the GCN performance is made suitable for human-algorithm interaction. Leveraging element geometry solely, the classification reaches a promising average performance of above 83% for the model-healing task with a reduced computation time. The encoded geometric knowledge from the design models is shown to be helpful in showcasing examples of segment classification in point clouds. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The most common way to listen to recorded music nowadays is via streaming platforms, which provide access to tens of millions of tracks. To assist users in effectively browsing these large catalogs, the integration of music recommender systems (MRSs) has become essential. Current real-world MRSs are often quite complex and optimized for recommendation accuracy. They combine several building blocks based on collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation. This complexity can hinder the ability to explain recommendations to end users, which is particularly important for recommendations perceived as unexpected or inappropriate. While pure recommendation performance often correlates with user satisfaction, explainability has a positive impact on other factors such as trust and forgiveness, which are ultimately essential to maintain user loyalty. In this article, we discuss how explainability can be addressed in the context of MRSs. We provide perspectives on how explainability could improve music recommendation algorithms and enhance user experience. First, we review common dimensions and goals of recommenders explainability and in general of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), and elaborate on the extent to which these apply-or need to be adapted-to the specific characteristics of music consumption and recommendation. Then, we show how explainability components can be integrated within a MRS and in what form explanations can be provided. Since the evaluation of explanation quality is decoupled from pure accuracy-based evaluation criteria, we also discuss requirements and strategies for evaluating explanations of music recommendations. Finally, we describe the current challenges for introducing explainability within a large-scale industrial MRS and provide research perspectives. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study developed an ensemble-learning-based bridge deck defect condition prediction model to help bridge managers make more rational and informed steel bridge deck maintenance decisions. Using the latest data from the NBI database for 2021, this study first used ADASYN to solve imbalance problems in the data, then built six ensemble learning models (RandomForest, ExtraTree, AdaBoost, GBDT, XGBoost, and LightGBM) and used a grid search method to determine the hyperparameters of the models. The optimal model was finally analyzed using the interpretable machine learning framework, SHAP. The results show that the optimal model is XGBoost, with an accuracy of 0.9495, an AUC of 0.9026, and an F1-Score of 0.9740. The most important factor affecting the condition of steel bridge deck defects is the condition of the bridge’s superstructure. In contrast, the condition of the bridge substructure and the year of bridge construction are relatively minor factors. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In a 16-years long-term fertilizer experiment, an in-depth study was carried out to evaluate the changes in soil physical, chemical, and biological properties under long-term fertilizer application and establish cause and effect relationship between soil properties and rice productivity using interpretable machine learning. There were 12 treatments involving control (without fertilizer application), 100% N (recommended dose of nitrogen), 100% NP (recommended dose of nitrogen and phosphorus), 100% PK (recommended dose of phosphorus and potassium), 100% NPK (recommended dose of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium), 150% NPK (50% higher nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium than recommended), 100% NPK + Zn (recommended nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium along with Zinc), 100% NPK + FYM (recommended nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium along with farmyard manure (FYM)), 100% NPK + FYM + LIME (recommended nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium along with FYM and lime), 100% NPK + Zn + S (recommended nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium along with zinc and sulphur), 100% NPK + Zn + B (recommended nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium along with Zinc and Boron) and 100% NPK + Lime (recommended nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium along with lime). At first, a conditional random forest model was built, based on which important variables were selected using the permutation-based variable importance approach. Further, the accumulated local effect plot was used to establish a cause and effect relationship between important soil properties and rice yield. Although most of the soil properties varied across the treatments, total potassium, protease, urease, and permanganate oxidisable carbon are the most important soil properties, individually accounting for up to 400 kg ha−1 variation in the rice productivity. The study demonstrated how interpretable machine learning techniques could be used in long-term fertilizer experiments to unravel the most meaningful information, and these techniques can be used in other similar long-term experiments. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Memristive LSTM networks have been proven as a powerful Neuromorphic Computing Architecture (NCA) for various time series forecasting tasks and are recognized as the next generation of AI. However, a lack of model explainability makes it hard to properly interpret forecasting results for existing memristive LSTM networks, which makes this NCA unreliable, unaccountable and untrustworthy. In this paper, an interpretable memristive (IM) LSTM network design is proposed for time series forecasting, where the mixture attention technique is embedded into IM-LSTM cells for characterizing the variable-wise feature and the temporal importance. The updating rules and training approach are also presented for this interpretable memristive LSTM network. We evaluate this approach on a probabilistic residential load forecasting task incorporating PV. By improving model interpretability, the most influential predictive factors can be verified by Built Environment domain experts, demonstrating the effectiveness of our design. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Disruption management during the airline scheduling process can be compartmentalized into proactive and reactive processes depending upon the time of schedule execution. The state of the art for decision-making in airline disruption management involves a heuristic human-centric approach that does not categorically study uncertainty in proactive and reactive processes for managing airline schedule disruptions. Hence, this paper introduces an uncertainty transfer function model (UTFM) framework that characterizes uncertainty for proactive airline disruption management before schedule execution, reactive airline disruption management during schedule execution, and proactive airline disruption management after schedule execution to enable the construction of quantitative tools that can allow an intelligent agent to rationalize complex interactions and procedures for robust airline disruption management. Specifically, we use historical scheduling and operations data from a major U.S. airline to facilitate the development and assessment of the UTFM, defined by hidden Markov models (a special class of probabilistic graphical models) that can efficiently perform pattern learning and inference on portions of large data sets. We employ the UTFM to assess two independent and separately disrupted flight legs from the airline route network. Assessment of a flight leg from Dallas to Houston, disrupted by air traffic control hold for bad weather at Dallas, revealed that proactive disruption management for turnaround in Dallas before schedule execution is impractical because of zero transition probability between turnaround and taxi-out. Assessment of another flight leg from Chicago to Boston, disrupted by air traffic control hold for bad weather at Boston, showed that proactive disruption management before schedule execution is possible because of non-zero state transition probabilities at all phases of flight operation. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The principle behind artificial intelligence is mimicking human intelligence in the way that it can perform tasks, recognize patterns, or predict outcomes through learning from the acquired data of various sources. Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms have been widely used in autonomous driving, recommender systems in electronic commerce and social media, fintech, natural language understanding, and question answering systems. Artificial intelligence is also gradually changing the landscape of healthcare research (Yu et al. in Biomed Eng 2:719–731, 25). The rule-based approach that relied on the curation of medical knowledge and the construction of robust decision rules had drawn significant attention in diagnosing diseases and clinical decision support since half a century ago. In recent years, machine learning algorithms such as deep learning that can account for complex interactions between features is shown to be promising in predictive modeling in healthcare (Deo in Circulation 132:1920–1930, 26). Although many of these artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms can achieve remarkably high performance, it is often difficult to be completely adopted in practical clinical environments due to the lack of explainability in some of these algorithms. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is emerging to assist in the communication of internal decisions, behavior, and actions to health care professionals. Through explaining the prediction outcomes, XAI gains the trust of the clinicians as they may learn how to apply the predictive modeling in practical situations instead of blindly following the predictions. There are still many scenarios to explore how to make XAI effective in clinical settings due to the complexity of medical knowledge. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Association Rule Mining is a machine learning method for discovering the interesting relations between the attributes in a huge transaction database. Typically, algorithms for Association Rule Mining generate a huge number of association rules, from which it is hard to extract structured knowledge and present this automatically in a form that would be suitable for the user. Recently, an information cartography has been proposed for creating structured summaries of information and visualizing with methodology called 'metro maps'. This was applied to several problem domains, where pattern mining was necessary. The aim of this study is to develop a method for automatic creation of metro maps of information obtained by Association Rule Mining and, thus, spread its applicability to the other machine learning methods. Although the proposed method consists of multiple steps, its core presents metro map construction that is defined in the study as an optimization problem, which is solved using an evolutionary algorithm. Finally, this was applied to four well-known UCI Machine Learning datasets and one sport dataset. Visualizing the resulted metro maps not only justifies that this is a suitable tool for presenting structured knowledge hidden in data, but also that they can tell stories to users. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In the healthcare setting, suicidal behavior prediction plays an important role in clinical decision making due to the suicide rate increasing day by day contributes to a decrease in productivity and increase in national expenditure. Several machine learning models are being developed to generate accurate predictions in a suicide attempt. However, there is a lack of interpretability, explainability and transparency with these predictive models. Therefore, the aim of this study is to improve explanations of machine learning models for predicting suicidal behavior based on clinical data using the Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) approach. The experiment shows that machine learning models with SHAP are able to interpret and understand the nature of an individual's predictions of suicidal behavior. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The ability to predict the drift capacity of reinforced concrete structural walls is critical to the seismic design process. The accuracy of such predictions has implications for construction costs, seismic safety, and reliability. However, the inability of an empirical model to capture any nonlinearity that exists between the drift capacity and different influencing variables can negatively impact the predictive performance. This study proposes a drift capacity prediction model for special structural walls based on the extreme gradient boosting machine-learning algorithm and a data set of 164 special boundary element wall tests. The efficiency of the proposed model is evaluated using a nested cross-validation approach, and the results reveal its superior predictive capabilities relative to the empirical equation adopted in ACI 318-19. To overcome the lack of interpretability of the model, SHapley Additive exPlanations are used to examine the relative individual and interactive effects of the different input variables on the drift capacity. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - There are different approaches in different areas of what the risk is. ISO 31000 risk management standards describe risk as the effect of uncertainty on objectives. Many existing risk assessment procedures are based on the assumption that risk is the amount of any damage or loss multi-plied by the probability of an event that could cause the damage. We are proposing a new risk approach, based on Hillson’s positive risk philosophy, that risk is not just a threat but also a com-position of new opportunities, efforts that need to be put in, and uncertainty. For this approach, we composed a risk formula and a methodology based on that formula. A prototypical software tool was developed, and an experiment was performed using this tool to evaluate the risk of several interconnected projects and validate the developed risk assessment methodology. It should be mentioned that, in the methodology, the decision-making process is performed traceably; therefore, it can be stated that it has explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) traits. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Time series forecasting of passenger demand is crucial for optimal planning of limited resources. For smart cities, passenger transport in urban areas is an increasingly important problem, because the construction of infrastructure is not the solution and the use of public transport should be encouraged. One of the most sophisticated techniques for time series forecasting is Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. These deep learning models are very powerful for time series forecasting but are not interpretable by humans (black-box models). Our goal was to develop a predictive and linguistically interpretable model, useful for decision making using large volumes of data from different sources. Our case study was one of the most demanded bus lines of Madrid. We obtained an interpretable model from the LSTM neural network using a surrogate model and the 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic model, which improves the linguistic interpretability of the generated Explainable Artificial Intelligent (XAI) model without losing precision. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Defect prediction models are proposed to help a team prioritize the areas of source code files that need Software Quality Assurance (SQA) based on the likelihood of having defects. However, developers may waste their unnecessary effort on the whole file while only a small fraction of its source code lines are defective. Indeed, we find that as little as 1-3 percent of lines of a file are defective. Hence, in this work, we propose a novel framework (called Line-DP) to identify defective lines using a model-agnostic technique, i.e., an Explainable AI technique that provides information why the model makes such a prediction. Broadly speaking, our Line-DP first builds a file-level defect model using code token features. Then, our Line-DP uses a state-of-the-art model-agnostic technique (i.e., LIME) to identify risky tokens, i.e., code tokens that lead the file-level defect model to predict that the file will be defective. Then, the lines that contain risky tokens are predicted as defective lines. Through a case study of 32 releases of nine Java open source systems, our evaluation results show that our Line-DP achieves an average recall of 0.61, a false alarm rate of 0.47, a top 20%LOC recall of 0.27, and an initial false alarm of 16, which are statistically better than six baseline approaches. Our evaluation shows that our Line-DP requires an average computation time of 10 seconds including model construction and defective line identification time. In addition, we find that 63 percent of defective lines that can be identified by our Line-DP are related to common defects (e.g., argument change, condition change). These results suggest that our Line-DP can effectively identify defective lines that contain common defects while requiring a smaller amount of inspection effort and a manageable computation cost. The contribution of this paper builds an important step towards line-level defect prediction by leveraging a model-agnostic technique. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Enterprises have recently adopted AI to human resource management (HRM) to evaluate employees' work performance evaluation. However, in such an HRM context where multiple stakeholders are complexly intertwined with different incentives, it is problematic to design AI reflecting one stakeholder group's needs (e.g., enterprises, HR managers). Our research aims to investigate what tensions surrounding AI in HRM exist among stakeholders and explore design solutions to balance the tensions. By conducting stakeholder-centered participatory workshops with diverse stakeholders (including employees, employers/HR teams, and AI/business experts), we identified five major tensions: 1) divergent perspectives on fairness, 2) the accuracy of AI, 3) the transparency of the algorithm and its decision process, 4) the interpretability of algorithmic decisions, and 5) the trade-off between productivity and inhumanity. We present stakeholder-centered design ideas for solutions to mitigate these tensions and further discuss how to promote harmony among various stakeholders at the workplace. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The fundamental properties of concrete structures, i. e., failure mode, capacity, and ductility, are important parameters in structural design and assessment procedures. Accurately predicting these parameters directly determines the reliability of structural design and analysis. In this paper, an machine learning (ML)-based prediction method for the fundamental properties of concrete structures was proposed, which can directly give the properties for any given design parameters (such as geometric dimensions, material properties, load conditions, etc.). In addition, the recently developed Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) method was also used to explain the outcome of the ML model, overcoming the 'black box' issue. Three typical examples were performed to validate the effectiveness and practicability of the machine learning methods. The results show that compared with the traditional empirical model, the machine learning method has higher prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, and can give the influence of different input parameters on the output results of the model, which realizes the interpretability of the prediction results, and is an effective supplement to the 'mechanism-driven' modeling method. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Next-generation sequencing has been essential to the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of January 2022, nearly 7 million severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) sequences are available to researchers in public databases. Sequence databases are an abundant resource from which to extract biologically relevant and clinically actionable information. As the pandemic has gone on, SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly evolved, involving complex genomic changes that challenge current approaches to classifying SARS-CoV-2 variants. Deep sequence learning could be a potentially powerful way to build complex sequence-to-phenotype models. Unfortunately, while they can be predictive, deep learning typically produces "black box" models that cannot directly provide biological and clinical insight. Researchers should therefore consider implementing emerging methods for visualizing and interpreting deep sequence models. Finally, researchers should address important data limitations, including (i) global sequencing disparities, (ii) insufficient sequence metadata, and (iii) screening artifacts due to poor sequence quality control. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A novel evolutionary approach for Explainable Artificial Intelligence is presented: the “Evolved Explanations” model (EvEx). This methodology combines Local Interpretable Model Agnostic Explanations (LIME) with Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithms to allow for automated segmentation parameter tuning in image classification tasks. In this case, the dataset studied is Patch-Camelyon, comprised of patches from pathology whole slide images. A publicly available Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was trained on this dataset to provide a binary classification for presence/absence of lymph node metastatic tissue. In turn, the classifications are explained by means of evolving segmentations, seeking to optimize three evaluation goals simultaneously. The final explanation is computed as the mean of all explanations generated by Pareto front individuals, evolved by the developed genetic algorithm. To enhance reproducibility and traceability of the explanations, each of them was generated from several different seeds, randomly chosen. The observed results show remarkable agreement between different seeds. Despite the stochastic nature of LIME explanations, regions of high explanation weights proved to have good agreement in the heat maps, as computed by pixel-wise relative standard deviations. The found heat maps coincide with expert medical segmentations, which demonstrates that this methodology can find high quality explanations (according to the evaluation metrics), with the novel advantage of automated parameter fine tuning. These results give additional insight into the inner workings of neural network black box decision making for medical data. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Smartphones enable to collect large data streams about phone calls that, once combined with Computational Intelligence techniques, bring great potential for improving the monitoring of patients with mental illnesses. However, the acoustic data streams recorded in uncontrolled environments are dynamically changing due to various sources of uncertainty. In addition, such acoustic data are usually difficult to interpret by psychiatrists. Within this study, we propose an approach based on Linguistic Summaries with Fuzzy Clustering (LS-FC) aiming at the development of human-consistent and easily interpretable summaries about relations between acoustic data and mental state of a patient affected by Bipolar Disorder, e.g., Most calls in the state of hypomania have low loudness compared to the state of euthymia [T = 1]. To capture the dynamics of acoustic data streams, we apply a dynamic incremental semi-supervised fuzzy clustering that synthesizes data into clusters. These clusters are represented by prototypes which are used for the construction of the membership functions describing linguistic terms e.g., low loudness, and then, linguistic summaries. The main contribution of this paper is the incorporation of information about clusters’ prototypes in the generation of linguistic summaries. The primary goal of this research is explainability. The semi-supervised learning algorithm is used mainly for deriving clusters and building improved linguistic summaries. Numerical results indicate that linguistic summaries provide intuitive and clear information about voice features in a patient's affective state and they are consistent with clinical observation. In particular, during most calls in hypomania/mania both the quality of the patient's voice and the dynamics of change in the spectrum signal reflected in spectral flux are low compared to euthymia. The proposed approach enables to summarize large data streams into meaningful descriptions that, although relatively simple, offer information granules that are very intuitive for clinicians and are promising to support the smartphone-based monitoring of bipolar disorder patients to inform about the potential change of mental state. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) methods are becoming widespread, especially when data are not sufficient to build classical statistical models, as is the case for cyber risk management. However, when applied to regulated industries, such as energy, finance, and health, AI methods lack explainability. Authorities aimed at validating machine learning models in regulated fields will not consider black-box models, unless they are supplemented with further methods that explain why certain predictions have been obtained, and which are the variables that mostly concur to such predictions. Recently, Shapley values have been introduced for this purpose: They are model agnostic, and powerful, but are not normalized and, therefore, cannot become a standardized procedure. In this paper, we provide an explainable AI model that embeds Shapley values with a statistical normalization, based on Lorenz Zonoids, particularly suited for ordinal measurement variables that can be obtained to assess cyber risk. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - As reconstruction and redevelopment accelerate, the generation of construction waste increases, and construction waste treatment technology is being developed accordingly, especially using artificial intelligence (AI). The majority of AI research projects fail as a consequence of poor learning data as opposed to the structure of the AI model. If data pre-processing and labeling, i.e., the processes prior to the training step, are not carried out with development purposes in mind, the desired AI model cannot be obtained. Therefore, in this study, the performance differences of the construction waste recognition model, after data pre-processing and labeling by individuals with different degrees of expertise, were analyzed with the goal of distinguishing construction waste accurately and increasing the recycling rate. According to the experimental results, it was shown that the mean average precision (mAP) of the AI model that trained on the dataset labeled by non-professionals was superior to that labeled by professionals, being 21.75 higher in the box and 26.47 in the mask, on average. This was because it was labeled using a similar method as the Microsoft Common Objects in Context (MS COCO) datasets used for You Only Look at Coefficients (YOLACT), despite them possessing different traits for construction waste. Construction waste is differentiated by texture and color; thus, we augmented the dataset by adding noise (texture) and changing the color to consider these traits. This resulted in a meaningful accuracy being achieved in 25 epochs—two fewer than the unreinforced dataset. In order to develop an AI model that recognizes construction waste, which is an atypical object, it is necessary to develop an explainable AI model, such as a reconstruction AI network, using the model’s feature map or by creating a dataset with weights added to the texture and color of the construction waste. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Reliability evaluations of modern test systems under the Industry 4.0 technologies, play a vital role in the successful transformation to NDE 4.0. This is due to the fact that NDE 4.0 is mainly based on the interconnection between the cyber-physical systems. When the individual reliability of the various important technologies from the Industry 4.0 such as the digital twin, digital thread, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), artificial intelligence (AI), data fusion, digitization, etc. is high, then it is possible to obtain the reliability beyond the intrinsic capability of the test system. In this paper, the significance of the reliability evaluation is reviewed under the vision of NDE 4.0, including examples of data fusion concepts as well as the importance of algorithms (like explainable artificial intelligence), the practical use is discussed and elaborated accordingly. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Vacuum insulated glazing (VIG) is a highly thermally insulating window technology, which boasts an extremely thin profile and lower weight as compared to gas-filled insulated glazing units of equivalent performance. The VIG is a double-pane configuration with a submillimeter vacuum gap maintained by small pillars positioned in between the panes, which can damage the glass during manufacturing, transportation and installation. For the purpose of automatically classifying the damage, we have developed, trained, and tested a deep learning model using convolutional neural networks. We employ the state-of-the-art methods Grad-CAM and Score-CAM of explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to provide an understanding of the internal mechanisms and were able to show that our classifier outperforms ResNet50V2 for identification of crack locations and geometry. Further analysis of our model's predictive capabilities demonstrates its superiority over state-of-the-art ResNet models in terms of convergence speed, accuracy, precision at 100% recall and AUC for ROC. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Joint cost management is a decisive factor for sustainable collaboration in supplier-buyer dyads. For both parties the establishment of an accurate cost estimation (CE) framework supports managing suppliers' costs as well as manufacturer's quotation costing. Grounded on resource dependence theory and following a design science research approach, this study introduces a multi-perspective CE system inspired by statistical learning, deep learning, decision making, and multi-agent theory. We evaluate our system by a single case and computer simulation study, using empirical data coming from observations and archives at a large Bavarian original equipment manufacturer (OEM). The results indicate that our CE approach allows to select the most significant cost-drivers and predict total costs of parts and assemblies with high accuracy. This supports the supplier in efficiently managing its costs. In making the CE blackbox model transparent using a combination of model agnostic post-hoc explainable artificial intelligence approaches we foster user acceptance for both suppliers and OEMs. All CE artifacts are ensembled in a multi-agent system to automatically manage costs with suppliers and furthermore, as a model extension, can lead to a collaborative price agreement. Our system supports supply chain managers on both sides in entering into a sustainable long partnership. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This perspective paper is based on several sessions by the members of the Round Table AI at FIRM1, with input from a number of external and international speakers. Its particular focus lies on the management of the model risk of productive models in banks and other financial institutions. The models in view range from simple rules-based approaches to Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine learning (ML) models with a high level of sophistication. The typical applications of those models are related to predictions and decision making around the value chain of credit risk (including accounting side under IFRS9 or related national GAAP approaches), insurance risk or other financial risk types. We expect more models of higher complexity in the space of anti-money laundering, fraud detection and transaction monitoring as well as a rise of AI/ML models as alternatives to current methods in solving some of the more intricate stochastic differential equations needed for the pricing and/or valuation of derivatives. The same type of model is also successful in areas unrelated to risk management, such as sales optimization, customer lifetime value considerations, robo-advisory, and other fields of applications. The paper refers to recent related publications from central banks, financial supervisors and regulators as well as other relevant sources and working groups. It aims to give practical advice for establishing a risk-based governance and testing framework for the mentioned model types and discusses the use of recent technologies, approaches, and platforms to support the establishment of responsible, trustworthy, explainable, auditable, and manageable AI/ML in production. In view of the recent EU publication on AI, also referred to as the EU Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA), we also see a certain added value for this paper as an instigator of further thinking outside of the financial services sector, in particular where “High Risk” models according to the mentioned EU consultation are concerned. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Data-driven techniques improve the quality of talent training comprehensively for university by discovering potential academic problems and proposing solutions. We propose an interpretable prediction method for university student academic crisis warning, which consists of K-prototype-based student portrait construction and Catboost–SHAP-based academic achievement prediction. The academic crisis warning experiment is carried out on desensitization multi-source student data of a university. The experimental results show that the proposed method has significant advantages over common machine learning algorithms. In terms of achievement prediction, mean square error (MSE) reaches 24.976, mean absolute error (MAE) reaches 3.551, coefficient of determination (R2) reaches 80.3%. The student portrait and Catboost–SHAP method are used for visual analysis of the academic achievement factors, which provide intuitive decision support and guidance assistance for education administrators. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Sometimes it is difficult, or even impossible, to acquire real data from sensors and machines that must be used in research. Such examples are the modern industrial platforms that fre-quently are reticent to share data. In such situations, the only option is to work with synthetic data obtained by simulation. Regarding simulated data, a limitation could consist in the fact that the data are not appropriate for research, based on poor quality or limited quantity. In such cases, the design of algorithms that are tested on that data does not give credible results. For avoiding such situations, we consider that mathematically grounded data‐quality assessments should be designed according to the specific type of problem that must be solved. In this paper, we approach a multivariate type of prediction whose results finally can be used for binary classification. We propose the use of a mathematically grounded data‐quality assessment, which includes, among other things, the analysis of predictive power of independent variables used for prediction. We present the assumptions that should be passed by the synthetic data. Different threshold values are established by a human assessor. In the case of research data, if all the assumptions pass, then we can consider that the data are appropriate for research and can be applied by even using other methods for solving the same type of problem. The applied method finally delivers a classification table on which can be applied any indicators of performed classification quality, such as sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F1 score, area under curve (AUC), receiver operating characteristics (ROC), true skill statistics (TSS) and Kappa coefficient. These indicators’ values offer the possibility of comparison of the results obtained by applying the considered method with results of any other method applied for solving the same type of problem. For evaluation and validation purposes, we performed an experimental case study on a novel synthetic dataset provided by the well‐known UCI data repository. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition which is responsible for a high proportion of intra-hospital deaths and related healthcare costs each year. Early detection and treatment of sepsis episodes is critical, since an early treatment may highly improve prognosis. This study proposed an original method to increase the interpretability of a set of machine learning models for the early detection of sepsis onset. Material and methods: Open data from the electronic medical records of 40,336 patients monitored in intensive care units (ICU), provided by the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2019 is used in this paper. We proposed a method including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model construction and tuning, as well as an original interpretability analysis method for the final stage. Results: A total of 24 models were developed and analyzed. The best model, based on 142 features achieved a 0.4274 utility score. The best compact model integrates only 20 selected features, and provided a utility score of 0.3862. Meanwhile, the proposed sensitivity analysis method allows for the identification of the most relevant markers to early detect the onset of sepsis, as well as their interdependence and relative importance on the final decision. Conclusion: A set of optimized machine-learning models were proposed for predicting sepsis early in a real-time way with high performance, and interpretable information including the most significant biomarkers were analyzed through novel interpretability method. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite increasing interest in developing interpretable machine learning methods, most recent studies have provided explanations only for single instances, require additional datasets, and are sensitive to hyperparameters. This paper proposes a confusion graph that reveals model weaknesses by constructing a confusion dictionary. Unlike other methods, which focus on the performance variation caused by single-neuron suppression, it defines the role of each neuron in two different perspectives: ‘correction’ and ‘violation.’ Furthermore, our method can identify the class relationships in similar positions at the feature level, which can suggest improvements to the model. Finally, the proposed graph construction is model-agnostic and does not require additional data or tedious hyperparameter tuning. Experimental results show that the information loss from omitting the channels guided by the proposed graph can result in huge performance degradation, from 91% to 33%, while the proposed graph only retains 1% of total neurons. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Medical process trace classification exploits the activity sequences logged by an healthcare organization to classify traces themselves on the basis of some performance properties; this information can be used for quality assessment. State-of-the-art process trace classification resorts to deep learning, a very powerful technique which however suffers from the lack of explainability. In this paper we aim at addressing this issue, motivated by a relevant application, i.e., the classification of process traces for quality assessment in stroke management. To this end we introduce the novel concept of trace saliency maps, an instrument able to highlight what trace activities are particularly significant for the classification task. Through trace saliency maps we justify the output of the deep learning architecture, and make it more easily interpretable to medical users. The good results in our use case have shown the feasibility of the approach, and let us make the hypothesis that it might be translated to other application settings and to other black box learners as well. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this work, we introduce, justify and demonstrate the Corrective Source Term Approach (CoSTA)—a novel approach to Hybrid Analysis and Modeling (HAM). The objective of HAM is to combine physics-based modeling (PBM) and data-driven modeling (DDM) to create generalizable, trustworthy, accurate, computationally efficient and self-evolving models. CoSTA achieves this objective by augmenting the governing equation of a PBM model with a corrective source term generated using a deep neural network. In a series of numerical experiments on one-dimensional heat diffusion, CoSTA is found to outperform comparable DDM and PBM models in terms of accuracy – often reducing predictive errors by several orders of magnitude – while also generalizing better than pure DDM. Due to its flexible but solid theoretical foundation, CoSTA provides a modular framework for leveraging novel developments within both PBM and DDM. Its theoretical foundation also ensures that CoSTA can be used to model any system governed by (deterministic) partial differential equations. Moreover, CoSTA facilitates interpretation of the DNN-generated source term within the context of PBM, which results in improved explainability of the DNN. These factors make CoSTA a potential door-opener for data-driven techniques to enter high-stakes applications previously reserved for pure PBM. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Our title alludes to the three Christmas ghosts encountered by Ebenezer Scrooge in A Christmas Carol, who guide Ebenezer through the past, present, and future of Christmas holiday events. Similarly, our article takes readers through a journey of the past, present, and future of medical AI. In doing so, we focus on the crux of modern machine learning: the reliance on powerful but intrinsically opaque models. When applied to the healthcare domain, these models fail to meet the needs for transparency that their clinician and patient end-users require. We review the implications of this failure, and argue that opaque models (1) lack quality assurance, (2) fail to elicit trust, and (3) restrict physician-patient dialogue. We then discuss how upholding transparency in all aspects of model design and model validation can help ensure the reliability and success of medical AI. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Electricity price forecasting in wholesale markets is an essential asset for deciding bidding strategies and operational schedules. The decision making process is limited if no understanding is given on how and why such electricity price points have been forecast. The present article proposes a novel framework that promotes human–machine collaboration in forecasting day-ahead electricity price in wholesale markets. The framework is based on a new model architecture that uses a plethora of statistical and machine learning models, a wide range of exogenous features, a combination of several time series decomposition methods and a collection of time series characteristics based on signal processing and time series analysis methods. The model architecture is supported by open-source automated machine learning platforms that provide a baseline reference used for comparison purposes. The objective of the framework is not only to provide forecasts, but to promote a human-in-the-loop approach by providing a data story based on a collection of model-agnostic methods aimed at interpreting the mechanisms and behavior of the new model architecture and its predictions. The framework has been applied to the Spanish wholesale market. The forecasting results show good accuracy on mean absolute error (1.859, 95% HDI [0.575, 3.924] EUR(MWh)−1) and mean absolute scaled error (0.378, 95% HDI [0.091, 0.934]). Moreover, the framework demonstrates its human-centric capabilities by providing graphical and numeric explanations that augments understanding on the model and its electricity price point forecasts. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - It is important to manage operational disruptions to ensure the success of supply chain operations. To achieve this aim, researchers have developed techniques that determine the occurrence of operational risk events which assists supply chain operational risk managers develop plans to manage them by detection/monitoring, mitigation/management, or optimization techniques. Various artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have been used to develop such techniques in the broad activities of operational risk management. However, all of these techniques are black box in their working nature. This means that the chosen technique cannot explain why it has given that output and whether it is correct and free from bias. To address this, researchers argue the need for supply chain management professionals to move towards using explainable AI methods for operational risk management. In this paper, we conduct a systematic literature review on the techniques used to determine operational risks and analyse whether they satisfy the requirement of them being explainable. The findings highlight the shortcomings and inspires directions for future research. From a managerial perspective, the paper encourages risk managers to choose techniques for supply chain operational risk management that can be auditable as this will ensure that the risk managers know why they should take a particular risk management action rather than just what they should do to manage the operational risks. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to solve the problems that may arise from the negative impact of EV charging loads on the power distribution network, it is very important to predict the distribution network variability according to EV charging loads. If appropriate facility reinforcement or system operation is made through evaluation of the impact of EV charging load, it will be possible to prevent facility failure in advance and maintain the power quality at a certain level, enabling stable network operation. By analysing the degree of change in the predicted load according to the EV load characteristics through the load prediction model, it is possible to evaluate the influence of the distribution network according to the EV linkage. This paper aims to investigate the effect of EV charging load on voltage stability, power loss, reliability index and economic loss of distribution network. For this, we transformed univariate time series of EV charging data into a multivariate time series using feature engineering techniques. Then, time series forecast models are trained based on the multivariate dataset. Finally, XAI techniques such as LIME and SHAP are applied to the models to obtain the feature importance analysis results. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The outlook of military cyber operations is changing due to the prospects of data generation and accessibility, continuous technological advancements and their (public) availability, technological and human (inter)connections increase, plus the dynamism, needs, diverse nature, perspectives, and skills of experts involved in their planning, execution, and assessment phases respecting (inter)national aims, demands, and trends. Such operations are daily conducted and recently empowered by AI to reach or protect their targets and deal with the unintended effects produced through their engagement on them and/or collateral entities. However, these operations are governed and surrounded by different uncertainty levels e.g., intended effects prediction, consideration of effective alternatives, and understanding new dimensions of possible (strategic) future(s). Hence, the legality and ethicality of such operations should be assured; particularly, in Offensive Military Cyber Operations (OMCO), the agents involved in their design/deployment should consider, develop, and propose proper (intelligent) measures/methods. Such mechanisms can be built embedding intelligent techniques based on hardware, software, and communication data plus expert-knowledge through novel systems like digital twins. While digital twins find themselves in their infancy in military, cyber, and AI academic research and discourses, they started to show their modelling and simulation potential and effective real-time decision support in different industry applications. Nevertheless, this research aims to (i) understand what digital twins mean in OMCO context while embedding explainable AI and responsible AI perspectives, and (ii) capture challenges and benefits of their development. Accordingly, a multidisciplinary stance is considered through extensive review in the domains involved packaged in a design framework meant to assist the agents involved in their development and deployment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the increasing number of software applications, evaluating code repositories is of paradigm importance for building elegant software systems. The quality of a code repository is dependent on the readability of the code and the easiness with which it can be understood by other developers. Code commenting is a key requirement to ensure that code is readable, reusable, and reproducible. While useful comments can help software developers write better software, irrelevant and ambiguous comments can be overwhelming and misguiding to developers. Automatic software maintenance can help evaluate code repository and associated comments to provide meaningful insight into code quality and also help improve code comprehension by flagging not useful comments and highlighting useful ones. This paper explores the task of identifying code comment usefulness using a pre-trained transformer-based language model. The data for evaluation has been sourced from FIRE 2022, December 9-13, 2022, Kolkata, India[1]. The paper tries to understand how pre-trained language models like BERT and GPT-2 trained on large text corpora including code repositories can help understand comment usefulness. Such a model can help identify the comment usefulness with a minimum requirement of feature engineering and thus be integrated into an automatic software maintenance system to generalize across code repositories. The proposed model achieves an F1-score 90.15% and accuracy of 91.21% in the test set with 90.12% precision and 90.47% recall. The paper also explores explainable AI techniques like LIME and Attention visualizer to understand how these transformer-based models are identifying comment usefulness and establishing a sense of trust for these black box language models to be used in building automated software maintenance technologies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Online data stream analysis is becoming more and more relevant, as the focus of daily life analyses shifts from offline processing to real-time acquisition and modeling of massive data from remote devices. In this paper, we focus our attention on the domain of telecommunications, in particular the video streaming services for moving devices (e.g., a passenger enjoying a movie during a car trip). Since the streaming service must provide a satisfactory level of quality of experience to the user, it is important to predict incoming problems on video quality. We used the well-known Hoeffding Decision Tree (HDT) for streaming data, tailored to regression problems, and we compared its performance with standard Regression Trees (RTs) to evaluate the potentiality of HDTs to forecast the quality of experience in terms of accuracy, time for learning, and memory used. Results show that, during the online learning process, the standard RT outperforms HDT in terms of accuracy, but is prone to under-performance in terms of timings and memory when applied to potentially massive data streaming scenarios. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - We propose a causal machine learning inference pipeline that combines a given predictive machine learning model with analytical estimations of average treatment effects. It enables to utilize any predictive model for causal inference, which makes it easy to adapt the approach to existing systems. By first estimating the average treatment effect of an intervention on predictors instead of the outcome variable, a causal relationship between an intervention and a wide range of variables is determined. Next, artificial samples are created that are evaluated using the given predictive model to link interventions and outcomes and also allows inferring measurements of uncertainty. Finally, simulations using again the given predictive model are performed to compute measurements of confidence and that allow to compare - according to the given predictive model - the effect of specific treatments. We furthermore demonstrate how this inference engine can be adapted to a privacy-preserving federated learning environment where training data is horizontally distributed across multiple datasets without compromising on our approach's accuracy. The approach has been evaluated on a use case with a predictive model for the quality of life score of cancer patients, to determine medical interventions to improve their individual quality of life score. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Agriculture is a major contributor to the Nation's economy since it is the most important component. It is common for plants to suffer from various kinds of diseases, which may be influenced by extreme climatic conditions and pests. This further lowers the quality of the harvest. In order to calculate the overall crop yield and productivity, early detection and accurate diagnosis of plant diseases are critical, which can significantly increase productivity and yield. Farmers have difficulty identifying diseases in plant leaves. Diagnosing diseases through traditional methods requires extensive field experience & expertise. The advancement of technology has allowed numerous strategies to be developed to identify plant diseases using Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning. To detect and classify various crop diseases, we propose two models, Inception V3 and ResNet-9, which are deployed on Plant Village Dataset and New Plant Disease Dataset. In addition to Deep Learning models, Explainable AI (XAI) tools such as LIME and Grad-CAM have been utilized for understanding the black-box nature of Deep Learning models. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Physiological signals obtained from wearable sensors has the potential to capture pedestrians' distress caused by physical disorders in the built environment, such as litter, abandoned houses, poorly maintained sidewalks, and graffiti. A limited amount of prior work has demonstrated the feasibility of deep learning models using physiological response data for tracking pedestrians' distress. Yet, the explain ability of such models estimating the distress in a time-continuous manner is not widely investigated. In this context, the objective of this paper is to examine an explainable machine learning algorithm for reliably identifying segments of physiological response data that contribute to the detection of physical disorders in the built environment. The data used in this study include a set of time series of electrodermal activity, electrocardiogram, heart rate, and skin temperature, collected from 67 participants walking on a pre-defined route in College Station, Texas, USA. Time continuous self-reports were recorded retrospectively for each participant over the span of the route. A long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network predicts reported stimuli of distress from participants. Next, the local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) algorithm was applied to the input time series of the LSTM model yielding an explanation of the corresponding distress label. Results from the model of the LIME algorithm are qualitatively evaluated, which indicate the presence of meaningful segments in the time series that have the greatest influence on the final distress prediction. Findings obtained by this research have the potential to advance our understanding about sources of pedestrians' distress, contributing to promoting urban walkability. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Bangladesh's garment industry is widely recognized and plays a significant role in the current global market. The nation's per capita income and citizens' living standards have risen significantly with the noteworthy hard work performed by the employees in this industry. The garment sector is more efficient once the target production can be achieved without any difficulties. But a frequent issue that comprises within this industry is, often the actual garment producing productivity of the people working there do not reach the previously determined target-productivity. The business suffers a significant loss when the productivity gap appears in this process. This approach seeks to address this issue by prediction of the actual productivity of the workers. To attain this goal, a machine learning approach is suggested for the productivity prediction of the employees, after experimentation with five machine learning models. The proposed approach displays a reassuring level of prediction accuracy, with a minimalist MAE (Mean Absolute Error) of 0.072, which is less than the existing Deep Learning model with a MAE of 0.086. This indicates that, application of this process can play a vital role in setting an accurate target production which might lead to more profit and production in the sector. Also, this work contains an explainable AI technique named SHAP for interpreting the model in order to see further information within it. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Hoax news can be defined as false information about events that tricks the readers into believing it as a genuine information. Explainable Artificial Intelligence or XAI is a simple algorithm that easy to understand. The example of XAI is Decision Tree. The methodology of this paper is Data Gathering to collect the data, preprocessing to give label to the parameters, Attribution Selection to determine which parameter to use by calculating the entropy and information gain result, then Decision Tree Construction using training datasets as a model for hoax detection, and calculating Evaluation Metric. This paper contains a total of 200 row of data (100 hoax and 100 fact). This research shows that the highest parameters for detecting hoax news are giving restless or panic emotion, containing hatred or angers, suggestion to share, and promising reward. By using 20% of the dataset for testing, the accuracy of this model is 82%. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Methods from explainable machine learning are increasingly applied. However, evaluation of these methods is often anecdotal and not systematic. Prior work has identified properties of explanation quality and we argue that evaluation should be based on them. In this position paper, we provide an evaluation process that follows the idea of property testing. The process acknowledges the central role of the human, yet argues for a quantitative approach for the evaluation. We find that properties can be divided into two groups, one to ensure trustworthiness, the other to assess comprehensibility. Options for quantitative property tests are discussed. Future research should focus on the standardization of testing procedures. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Vehicle category classification is an integral part of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). In this context, vision-based approaches are of increasing interest due to recent progress in camera hardware and machine learning algorithms. Currently, for vision-based classification an end-to-end approach based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is the state-of-the-art. However, their inherent black-box approach and the difficulty of modifying existing or adding new categories currently limit their application in ITS. Here, we present an alternative classification approach that partially removes these limitations. It consists of three parts: 1) a CNN-based detector for semantically strong vehicle parts provides the basis for 2) a feature construction step, followed by 3) the final classification based on a decision tree. Ultimately this approach will allow to keep the training-intensive part-detector fixed, once a sufficiently large set of vehicle parts has been trained. Modification of existing categories and addition of new ones are possible by changes to the feature construction and classification steps only. We illustrate the effectiveness of this approach through the extension of the vehicle classifier from 11 to 16 categories by adding an 'articulate' feature. In addition, the vehicle parts provide clear interpretability and the conceptually simple feature construction and decision tree classifier provide explainability of the approach. Nevertheless, the part-based classifier achieves comparable accuracy to an end-to-end CNN model trained on all 16 classes. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Multi-label classification (MLC) is an ML task of predictive modeling in which a data instance can simultaneously belong to multiple classes. MLC is increasingly gaining interest in different application domains such as text mining, computer vision, and bioinformatics. Several MLC algorithms have been proposed in the literature, resulting in a meta-optimization problem that the user needs to address: which MLC approach to select for a given dataset? To address this algorithm selection problem, we investigate in this work the quality of an automated approach that uses characteristics of the datasets - so-called features - and a trained algorithm selector to choose which algorithm to apply for a given task. For our empirical evaluation, we use a portfolio of 38 datasets. We consider eight MLC algorithms, whose quality we evaluate using six different performance metrics. We show that our automated algorithm selector outperforms any of the single MLC algorithms, and this is for all evaluated performance measures. Our selection approach is explainable, a characteristic that we exploit to investigate which meta-features have the largest influence on the decisions made by the algorithm selector. Finally, we also quantify the importance of the most significant meta-features for various domains. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The paper presents a new high-level object-oriented programming language L* which is a conservative extension of the p-complete logical programming language L. The p-complete language L was developed by us earlier within the framework of semantic programming theory based on PAG-theorem, p-iterative and conditional terms. Thus, L*-programs can be used to implement any algorithms of polynomial complexity in such areas as artificial intelligence, robotics and smart contracts. This is especially true of the so-called explainable artificial intelligence (or briefly XAI), where it is necessary not only to give out the result based on the obtained data, but also to explain this result in a human-understandable language. This requires a programming language based on the basic constructions of mathematical logic such as logical formulas and terms. Moreover, the syntax of language L* is as close as possible to the most popular programming languages such as C++, PHP, JavaScript. Which provides programmers with a quick entry into development. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Data farming is a simulation-based methodology used within the defense community to analyze complex systems and provide insights to decision makers. It can produce very large, multi-dimensional data sets that require sophisticated analysis tools, such as metamodeling. Advances in explainable artificial intelligence have expanded the types of metamodels that can be considered; however, constructing a well-fitting machine learning metamodel involves many tasks that can become time consuming for an analyst. Automated machine learning (autoML) can save an analyst time by automating metamodel training, tuning and testing. Using outputs of an agent-based simulation of a military ground-based air defense scenario, we compared the performance of metamodels trained using autoML and different experimental designs. We found that autoML can reasonably automate the construction of metamodels and adds robustness to the analysis by considering multiple types of metamodels; however, the type and size of experimental design can significantly impact metamodel performance. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper contributes to interpretable machine learning via visual knowledge discovery in general line coordinates (GLC). The concepts of hyperblocks as interpretable dataset units and general line coordinates are combined to create a visual self-service machine learning model. Dynamic Scaffolding Coordinates as lossless multidimensional coordinate systems are proposed, and their applications as visual models is shown. DSC1 and DSC2 can map multiple dataset attributes to a single two-dimensional (X, Y) Cartesian plane using a graph construction algorithm. The hyperblock analysis was used to determine visually appealing dataset attribute orders and to reduce line occlusion. It is shown that hyperblocks can generalize decision tree rules and a series of DSC1 or DSC2 plots can visualize a decision tree. The DSC1 and DSC2 plots were tested on benchmark datasets from the UCI ML repository. They allowed for visual classification of data. Additionally, areas of hyperblock impurity were discovered and used to establish dataset splits that highlight the upper estimate of worst-case model accuracy to guide model selection for high-risk decision-making. Major benefits of DSC1 and DSC2 is their highly interpretable nature. They allow domain experts to control or establish new machine learning models through visual pattern discovery. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Interpretable machine learning models have recently received a considerable attention for their capability to provide understandable explanations of predictions evoked from complex systems. In this paper a novel automatic interpretable classification scheme is introduced based on a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM). The proposed approach aims to address the problem of image classification using high-level features, extracted from a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The proposed FCM constitutes a fuzzy-graph structure for representing causal reasoning concerning semantic concepts of the real world, as these are depicted within different images. An advantage over current classifiers is that the proposed FCM embeds a mechanism for automatic determination of its structure from the datasets used in each experiment. More importantly, it provides interpretable classification results, whereas it is simple to implement. Experimental results using publicly available datasets show that the proposed approach efficiently extends the application of the traditional FCMs into image classification problem. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The fact that insecticidal pests impair significant agricultural productivity has become one of the main challenges in agriculture. Several prerequisites, however, exist for a high-performance automated system capable of detecting nuisance insects from massive amounts of visual data. We employed deep learning approaches to correctly identify insect species from large volumes of data in this study model and explainable AI to decide which part of the photos is used to categorize the insects from the data. We chose to deal with the large-scale IP102 dataset since we worked with a large dataset. There are almost 75,000 pictures in this collection, divided into 102 categories. We ran state-of-the-art tests on the unique IP102 data set to evaluate our proposed solution. We used five different Deep Neural Networks (DNN) models for image classification: VGG19, ResNet50, EfficientNetB5, DenseNet121, InceptionV3, and implemented the LIME-based XAI (Explainable Artificial Intelligence) framework. DenseNet121 outperformed all other networks, and we also implemented it to classify specific crop insect species. The classification accuracy ranged from 46.31 percent to 95.36 percent for eight crops. Moreover, we have compared our prediction to that of earlier articles to assess the efficacy of our research. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Model Interpretability is critical for analyzing the potential risks inherent to the utilization of black-box neural networks in the medical domain. The current methodologies for Parkinson's disease (PD) detection require expertise from medical professionals alongside an expensive and time-consuming procedure. AI-driven Deep Learning (DL) models have generated state-of-the-art performance and have the potential to improve the process of PD detection by leveraging the early stage symptom of vocal deterioration to enable early identification of the disease. However, the potential of DL for PD selection has remained untapped thus far because of the lack of model interpretability and the possibility of even an accurate model failing to capture the correct causal relationship between the input signal and the prediction. This work implements a neural network that contains vowel phonations. The model achieved a classification accuracy of 90.32% with a precision, recall and F1 Score of 0.91, 0.90 and 0.905. A novel model interpretation algorithm is proposed that divides the audio file into logical chunks and provides a category label identifying the productivity of each chunk towards correct inference. This is based on its interactions with every other audio region in the file, and the effective change of model performance and confidence with its inclusion. An audio instance within a clip is significant for desired output only in conjunction with other audio regions that together generate a meaningful pattern indicating the existence of PD. The algorithm also ranks all audio chunks in the order of their importance to the correct prediction by analyzing the degree in which their impact varies when combined with other audio regions. This paper demonstrates that DL can be leveraged to create a reliable, accurate, and efficient method for PD Detection and the model can be extended to provide interpretability to the inferences in a way that is scalable, and free from bias. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The tunnel lining process with segments is a labour-intensive task, for which the expertise of Tunnel Boring Machines’ operators is crucial. For this task, human expertise can be evaluated based on the average time of building a tunnel ring. Data-driven identification of the different levels of operators’ expertise can help to understand the causes of possible discrepancies. Consequently, bridging possibly existing gaps in expertise can be achieved through more training offered to less experienced operators or through support from user-assistance systems. In order to make the expertise more tangible, we trained deep learning models to classify expertise profiles of erector operators based on time series data accrued during the process. Afterwards, we investigate these with explainable artificial intelligence techniques to identify features with the highest influence on the performance prediction and derive regions of interest in ring-building sequences leading to specific performance classifications. Finally, we discuss how the observations from our study can contribute to designing assistance systems that support operators toward a more efficient ring-building process. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Quality control allows companies to verify the products' conformance to requirements and specifications and thus build customer satisfaction and the brand's reputation. Artificial Intelligence enables higher degrees of visual inspection automation, reducing inspection times while ensuring all products are evaluated under the same criteria. This research addresses the problem of an automated visual inspection setup complemented with a manual revision process to inspect manufactured pieces for which the model is most uncertain. We envision that such a visual inspection process can leverage active learning to continuously improve the classification models' quality based on newly labeled data. Our supervised classification model achieves an AUC ROC of 0,9894. We use probability calibration techniques to set a quality threshold and decide whether a given product must undergo manual revision or the model's prediction can be trusted. Finally, we explore using Explainable Artificial Intelligence, anomaly maps, and the nearest known labeled image to hint to the user about potential defects and reduce labeling errors while speeding up the labeling process. Considering a 99,90% probability threshold, we found that only 40% of the streamed images would be sent to manual revision. Furthermore, the best quality of manual revision was achieved by hinting the user with the closest known labeled image. Such setting increased the precision, recall, and F1 scores by at least 0,5 points compared to the annotation quality when images were displayed with the original class imbalance and without defect hinting. We performed the experiments on real-world data provided by Philips Consumer Lifestyle BV. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Over the last decade, the fintech industry has witnessed fast growth, where online or digital lending has appeared as an alternative and flexible form of financing in addition to popular forms of financing, such as term loans, and expedited the entire lending process. High-tech online platforms have provided better user experiences and attracted more consumers and SMBs (small and medium-sized businesses). Partnerships and collaborations have also been forged between financial startups and incumbents or traditional lending institutions to further differentiate products and services to niche markets and accelerate the way of innovations. With the evolving landscape of the fintech sector, risk management tools such as credit scoring have become essential to assess credit risks such as default or delinquency based on debtor credit history or status. Many fintech companies are relatively young and sometimes serve only a small portfolio with a relatively scarce delinquency history. How can they predict default risk when making financing decisions on new applications? In this paper, we document a framework of leveraging supplemental samples of consumer or business credit information from the credit bureau that can be augmented with fintech applications for credit scoring based on theoretical and empirical studies of credit application data from a Canadian online auto leasing corporation. We also provide and compare credit scoring modeling solutions utilizing interpretable AI and machine learning methods such as logistic regression, decision tree, neural network, and XBGoost. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Comparative analysis of quality and safety monitoring technology has always been the most sensitive topic in the food field. Quality and safety monitoring of liquor is the prerequisite for maintaining market stability and guaranteeing quality. Therefore, it is very important to judge the quality of liquor correctly. In this study, the XGBoost model was used to evaluate the liquor quality of 4899 liquor samples from the Vinho Verde white wine sample dataset in northern Portugal. The influence of 11 liquor characteristics such as volatile Acidity, alcohol, density, and free sulfur dioxide on liquor quality was explained by SHAP, PDP, and other interpretation techniques. The results showed that the XGBoost model had better evaluation performance than the general model. Among the 11 liquor characteristics studied in this paper, liquor quality was affected not only by alcohol content but also by volatile acid, density, and residual sugar. This study can not only provide an objective evaluation method for liquor quality but also make people a further intuitive understanding of the evaluation results, so as to produce better liquor quality. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper, the authors present a new architectural concept named as Internet-of-Explainable-Digital-Twins (IoxDT), that holistically integrates explainable AI (xAI) and digital twin (DT) in Industry 5.0 production processes. The authors present the architecture over a versatile production system (VPS) corn production plant, where processes are sensor-driven and monitored to minimize bias. The collaboration of DT and xAI leverages the robustness, predictability, and maintainability of VPS processes. In the proposed architecture, the VPS sensor-controlled inputs are sent to the DT controller. The controller is supplied with virtual inputs, which are replicas of real inputs, and the controller behaviour is monitored. The outputs are connected to an xAI module designed with Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) model, which generates the output predictability and dependence on inputs. The unsafe outputs are rejected. A case-study evaluation is carried out in terms of the mean and standard deviation of DT module creation, and SHAP predictability outputs, which shows an accuracy of 96% of unsafe inputs. The proposed results indicate the viability of the framework in real Industry 5.0 VPS setups. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study aims at providing a conceptualized framework for railway to realize the Digital Twin (DT) beyond traditional structural modeling or information systems. First, we deduce a generic formula that shows that DT estimates the future states and decides actions beforehand. Then, based on this formula, we design a generic framework called RailTwin. The framework combines the insight of current states, the foresight representing the prediction of the future states, and the oversight based on the current and future state to enable automation and actuation. The key enabler of this framework to obtain these states is Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, including Deep Learning, Transfer Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Explainable AI. We present a use case for asset health inspection and monitoring through the proposed framework. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This research tries to establish a communication bridge between the decision making of a practicing physician and a machine learning model. Machine learning has long been used to assist in diagnosing patients through deep learning and medical image analysis. However, in medical science, it is possible to have multiple right answers when treating patients. This leaves the practitioners room to exercise their judgement on what would be best for the patient. The machine learning model can be a communication tool to assist the practitioners in reach the final decision. In this paper, the machine learning model used for this experiment is XGBoost, a gradient boosted decision tree. Through the experiment with the real patient data, we show how decision tree constructions are easily readable for medical determination. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Feature selection (FS) has been a prominent research topic for a long time, not only in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification but also in other related fields. It has gained even more popularity recently, especially with the growing interest in explainable artificial intelligence (AI) studies. The literature on FS is extensively studied not only in remote sensing but also in the domain of computer science. However, most of the conventional approaches ignore information about the manifold structure of the data, which might be critical, especially for the analysis of hyperspectral data due to their complex nonlinear structure. This study introduces an FS approach based on graph embedding (GE) and global sensitivity analysis, utilizing the first-order terms of the high dimensional model representation (HDMR). The effectiveness of the proposed method is analyzed on four hyperspectral datasets utilizing some evaluation criteria, including classification accuracy and clustering quality, and compared to seven state-of-the-art FS methods. The results show that the proposed method typically outperforms the others and is notably more computationally efficient. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Anomaly detection techniques in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) are driving traditional industries towards an unprecedented level of efficiency, productivity and performance. They are typically developed based on supervised and unsupervised machine learning models. However, some machine learning models are facing 'black box' problems, namely the rationale behind the algorithm is not understandable. Recently, several models on explainable anomaly detection have emerged. The 'black box' problems have been studied by using such models. But few works focus on applications in the IIoT field, and there is no related review of explainable anomaly detection techniques. In this survey, we provide an overview of explainable anomaly detection techniques in IIoT. We propose a new taxonomy to classify the state-of-the-art explainable anomaly detection techniques into two categories, namely intrinsic based explainable anomaly detection and explainer based explainable anomaly detection. We further discuss the applications of explainable anomaly detection across various IIoT fields. Finally, we suggest future study options in this rapidly expanding subject. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: DNA methylation has a significant effect on gene expression and can be associated with various diseases. Meta-analysis of available DNA methylation datasets requires development of a specific workflow for joint data processing. Results: We propose a comprehensive approach of combined DNA methylation datasets to classify controls and patients. The solution includes data harmonization, construction of machine learning classification models, dimensionality reduction of models, imputation of missing values, and explanation of model predictions by explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) algorithms. We show that harmonization can improve classification accuracy by up to 20% when preprocessing methods of the training and test datasets are different. The best accuracy results were obtained with tree ensembles, reaching above 95% for Parkinson's disease. Dimensionality reduction can substantially decrease the number of features, without detriment to the classification accuracy. The best imputation methods achieve almost the same classification accuracy for data with missing values as for the original data. XAI approaches have allowed us to explain model predictions from both populational and individual perspectives. Conclusions: We propose a methodologically valid and comprehensive approach to the classification of healthy individuals and patients with various diseases based on whole-blood DNA methylation data using Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia as examples. The proposed algorithm works better for the former pathology, characterized by a complex set of symptoms. It allows to solve data harmonization problems for meta-analysis of many different datasets, impute missing values, and build classification models of small dimensionality. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Interpretability of DNN-based object detection has been a rising concern for the research community. The first step towards this goal is a saliency map that visualizes the importance (saliency) of pixels in an image for the object detected by a specific model. Black-box based methods generate a saliency map without the need to look into the internals of a model, thus applicable to all models without the need of adaptation. In addition, they provide more reliable evaluation on the saliency of pixels than white-box methods by means of the absence of these pixels from the image. However, with current black-box methods, the absence of pixels is produced by random image masks. Despite the need of a great number of random masks for sufficient coverage, the quality of the pixel saliency is not assured to be satisfactory. In this work, we propose a more effective black-box framework with hierarchical masking. In this framework, called GSM-HM, pixel saliency is evaluated at multiple levels, with each lower level performing a refinement on the saliency information of the upper level. This hierarchical framework significantly reduces the masking efforts on less valuable pixels, thus it can produce saliency maps with higher qualities. In our experiments, the quality of a generated saliency map is evaluated with four different metrics: deletion, insertion, convergence and RAM (the ratio of average to maximum). Compared with D-RISE, a recent black-block method, GSM-HM generates more accurate saliency maps evaluated by these metrics. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Numerous studies have established the capability of machine learning in detecting health misinformation, but none addresses model interpretability. We propose two approaches to visualization for a criteria-based system that automatically evaluates health news quality. The model's interpretability arises from providing sentence-level evidence to support the document-level automatic criterion evaluation outcome. The two approaches were both implemented and then evaluated on four unseen cases, for one of ten established criteria. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - During the last few decades, the quality of water has deteriorated significantly due to pollution and many other issues. As a consequence of this, there is a need for a model that can make accurate projections about water quality. This work shows the comparative analysis of different machine learning approaches like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest, Gradient Boost, and Ada Boost, used for the water quality classification. The model is trained on the Water Quality Index dataset available on Kaggle. Z-score is used to normalize the dataset before beginning the training process for the model. Because the given dataset is unbalanced, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) is used to balance the dataset. Experiments results depict that Random Forest and Gradient Boost give the highest accuracy of 81%. One of the major issues with the machine learning model is lack of transparency which makes it impossible to evaluate the results of the model. To address this issue, explainable AI (XAI) is used which assists us in determining which features are the most important. Within the context of this investigation, Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) is utilized to ascertain the significance of the features. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Recent work on explainability raises the question of what different types of explanations actually mean. One idea is that explanations can reveal information about the behaviour of the model on a subset of the input space. When this way of interpreting explanations is thought as an interactive process, inferences from explanations can be seen as a form of reasoning. In the case of case-based reasoning with abstract argumentation (AA-CBR), previous work has used arbitrated dispute trees as a methodology for explanation. Those are dispute trees where nodes are seen as losing or winning depending on the outcome for the new case under consideration. In this work we show how arbitrated dispute trees can be readapted for different inputs, which allows a broader interpretation of them, capturing more of the input-output behaviour of the model. We show this readaptation is correct by construction, and thus the resulting reasoning based on this reuse is monotonic and thus necessarily a faithful explanation. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - For highly sensitive products such as pharmaceuticals, quality is a decisive factor in ensuring the therapeutic benefit that consumers expect and not jeopardizing consumers' health. So far, the quality control of pharmaceuticals is largely performed manually by qualified individuals. However, this is a time-consuming, repetitive, and error-prone process subject to natural performance fluctuations. To contribute to addressing this issue, we present an automated quality control approach for pharmaceutical capsules using a transfer learning-based convolutional neural network with a balanced accuracy of 97.27%, outperforming all current benchmarks. To increase trust in the model predictions, we incorporated two explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods into our approach. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The steelmaking industry is one of the most energy-intensive industries and is responsible for 4% of the world's total greenhouse gas emissions. Solutions to improve operational efficiency can therefore bring major improvements to the overall environmental performance of the entire industry. This article proposes a novel steel quality prediction system based on gradient boosting trees that can be used to predict the quality of steel products during manufacturing. The prediction system enables the detection of possible surface defects in the early phase of the manufacturing process, thus avoiding costly and time-consuming manufacturing efforts to address defective products. In this study, we trained a prediction model with data collected from an SSAB Europe steelmaking plant in Raahe, Finland. From the 296 process parameters measured in the liquid steel stage of steelmaking, we selected 89 input features to train and test the prediction model. The model was then integrated into a quality monitoring tool (QMT) to utilize real-time manufacturing data in its predictions. The validation process showed that the prediction model can find more than 50% of defective steel products by marking only about 10% of the steel products as potentially at risk of surface defects in plate rolling. This can potentially save time in the quality control phase and improve process efficiency. To gain more insights into the model predictions, we used SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to find a potential connection between the process input parameters and surface defects. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence and Digital Twins play an integral role in driving innovation in the domain of intelligent driving. Long short-term memory (LSTM) is a leading driver in the field of lane change prediction for manoeuvre anticipation. However, the decision-making process of such models is complex and non-transparent, hence reducing the trustworthiness of the smart solution. This work presents an innovative approach and a technical implementation for explaining lane change predictions of layer normalized LSTMs using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). The core implementation includes consuming live data from a digital twin on a German highway, live predictions and explanations of lane changes by extending LRP to layer normalized LSTMs, and an interface for communicating and explaining the predictions to a human user. We aim to demonstrate faithful, understandable, and adaptable explanations of lane change prediction to increase the adoption and trustworthiness of AI systems that involve humans. Our research also emphases that explainability and state-of-the-art performance of ML models for manoeuvre anticipation go hand in hand without negatively affecting predictive effectiveness. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The Machine Learning applications in the medical field using omics data are countless and promising, highlighting the possibility of creating long-term predictive models for highly prevalent diseases. Nevertheless, to take advantage of the virtues of omics data and machine learning tools, we first need to perform adequate data pre-processing just as taking some considerations for the constructions of the models. The present paper is an example of how to face the main challenges encountered when constructing machine learning predictive models with multi-omics human data. Some topics covered in this work include a description of the main particularities of each omics data layer, the most appropriate pre-processing approaches for each source, and a collection of good practices and tips for applying machine learning to this kind of data with predictive purposes. Using real data examples (blood samples), we illustrate how some of the key issues are addressed in this kind of research (technical noise, biological heterogeneity, class imbalance, high dimensionality, and presence of missing values, among others). Additionally, we set the basis for future work incorporating some proposals to improve models, arguing their need according to encountered insights. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - We propose a method for explaining the results of black box image classifiers to domain experts and end users, combining two example-based explanatory approaches: Firstly, prototypes as representative data points for classes, and secondly, contrastive example comparisons in the form of near misses and near hits. A prototype globally explains the relevant characteristics for a entire class, whereas near hit and near miss explain the local decision boundary of a specific prediction. To combine both types of explanations within one framework is novel and we propose that presenting both types of explanations is especially helpful for domain experts in visual domains. To improve the faithfulness of the explanations, we investigated an unbiased, generic embedding and a model-related (model-specific) embedding for handling the images. The proposed approaches are evaluated regarding parameter selection and suitability on two different data sets – the well-known MNIST and a real-world industrial quality control data set. Finally, it is shown how global and local example-based explanation can be combined and realized within a demonstrator. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the rapid improvement of human standards, the development of urban centers has significantly contributed to water contamination and environmental pollution hence compromising the safety of drinking water for public health. The ecological safety and human health have continuously lowered due to hazardous pollution factors like chemicals and pathogens. Different algorithms and blackbox Machine Learning models have been used to develop water quality/safety criteria. This work presents an Explainable Artificial Intelligence method, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to transparently and explainably assess the most important metrics that these models use in determining water quality. The simulated results will provide theoretical support to policy makers on how to maintain water quality or safety within urban areas and improve pollution control, water and ecological management. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A popular approach to overcome the complexity of cybersecurity and sophistication of cyber attacks is implementing artificial intelligence (AI)-based security controls that integrate machine learning (ML) algorithms into security controls, such as intrusion and malware detection. These AI-based security controls are considered more effective than traditional signature-based and heuristics-based controls. However, the growing adoption of advanced ML algorithms is turning these AI-based security controls into black-box systems. We postulate that these black-box AI methods would make risk management and informed decision-making challenging. Using smart grid intrusion detection as our context, we illustrate our arguments by outlining a risk assessment plan to discuss the transparency and interpretability of an AI-based security control. We contribute to the literature by changing the focus from performance to explainability of algorithms, highlighting critical steps in explainability for integrating into risk assessment planning, and outlining the implications of explainability in AI-based intrusion detection systems. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Deep learning based methods hold state-of-the-art results in low-level image processing tasks, but remain difficult to interpret due to their black-box construction. Unrolled optimization networks present an interpretable alternative to constructing deep neural networks by deriving their architecture from classical iterative optimization methods without use of tricks from the standard deep learning tool-box. So far, such methods have demonstrated performance close to that of state-of-the-art models while using their interpretable construction to achieve a comparably low learned parameter count. In this work, we propose an unrolled convolutional dictionary learning network (CDLNet) and demonstrate its competitive denoising and joint denoising and demosaicing (JDD) performance both in low and high parameter count regimes. Specifically, we show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art fully convolutional denoising and JDD models when scaled to a similar parameter count. In addition, we leverage the model's interpretable construction to propose a noise-adaptive parameterization of thresholds in the network that enables state-of-the-art blind denoising performance, and near-perfect generalization on noise-levels unseen during training. Furthermore, we show that such performance extends to the JDD task and unsupervised learning. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Nowadays, Knowledge Graphs (KG) are among the most powerful mechanisms to represent knowledge and integrate data from multiple domains. However, most of the available data sources are still described in heterogeneous data structures, schemes, and formats. The conversion of these sources into the desirable KG requires manual and time-consuming tasks, such as programming translation scripts, defining declarative mapping rules, etc. In this vision paper, we analyze the trends regarding the automation of KG construction but also the use of mapping languages for the same process, and align the two by analyzing their tasks and a few exemplary tools. Our aim is not to have a complete study but to investigate if there is potential in this direction and, if so, to discuss what challenges we need to address to guarantee the maintainability, explainability, and reproducibility of the KG construction. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Advances in the development of AI and its application in many areas of society have given rise to an ever-increasing need for society’s members to understand at least to a certain degree how these technologies work. Where users are concerned, most approaches in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) assume a rather narrow view on the social process of explaining and show an undifferentiated assessment of explainees’ understanding, which mostly are considered passive recipients of information. The actual knowledge, motives, needs and challenges of (lay)users in algorithmic environments remain mostly missing. We argue for the consideration of explanation as a social practice in which explainer and explainee co-construct understanding jointly. Therefore, we seek to enable lay users to document, evaluate, and reflect on distinct AI interactions and correspondingly on how explainable AI actually is in their daily lives. With this contribution we want to discuss our methodological approach that enhances the documentary method by the implementation of ‘digital diaries’ via the mobile instant messaging app WhatsApp – the most used instant messaging service worldwide. Furthermore, from a theoretical stance, we examine the socio-cultural patterns of orientation that guide users’ interactions with AI and their imaginaries of the technologies – a sphere that is mostly obscured and hard to access for researchers. Finally, we complete our paper with empirical insights by referring to previous studies that point out the relevance of perspectives on explaining and understanding as a co-constructive social practice. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In situations like the coronavirus pandemic, colleges and universities are forced to limit their offline and regular academic activities. Extended postponement of high-stakes exams due to health risk hereby reduces productivity and progress in later years. Several countries decided to organize the exams online. Since many other countries with large education boards had an inadequate infrastructure and insufficient resources during the emergency, education policy experts considered a solution to simultaneously protect public health and fully resume high-stakes exams -by canceling offline exam and introducing a uniform assessment process to be followed across the states and education boards. This research proposes a novel system using an AI model to accomplish the complex task of evaluating all students across education boards with maximum level of fairness and analyzes the ability to fairly appraise exam grades in the context of high-stakes examinations during SARS-CoV-2 emergency. Basically, a logistic regression classifier on top of a deep neural network is used to output predictions that are as fair as possible for all learners. The predictions of the proposed grade-awarding system are explained by the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) framework. SHAP allowed to identify the features of the students' portfolios that contributed most to the predicted grades. In the setting of an empirical analysis in one of the largest education systems in the Global South, 81.85% of learners were assigned fair scores while 3.12% of the scores were significantly smaller than the actual grades, which would have had a detrimental effect if it had been applied for real. Furthermore, SHAP allows policy-makers to debug the predictive model by identifying and measuring the importance of the factors involved in the model's final decision and removing those features that should not play a role in the model's “reasoning” process. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the huge expansion of artificial intelligence in medical imaging, many clinical warehouses, medical centres and research communities, have organized patients’ data in well-structured datasets. These datasets are one of the key elements to train AI-enabled solutions. Additionally, the value of such datasets depends on the quality of the underlying data. To maintain the desired high-quality standard, these datasets are actively cleaned and continuously expanded. This labelling process is time-consuming and requires clinical expertise even when a simple classification task must be performed. Therefore, in this work, we propose to tackle this problem by developing a new pipeline for the modality classification of medical images. Our pipeline has the purpose to provide an initial step in organizing a large collection of data and grouping them by modality, thus reducing the involvement of costly human raters. In our experiments, we consider 4 popular deep neural networks as the core engine of the proposed system. The results show that when limited datasets are available simpler pre-trained networks achieved better results than more complex and sophisticated architectures. We demonstrate this by comparing the considered networks on the ADNI dataset and by exploiting explainable AI techniques that help us to understand our hypothesis. Still today, many medical imaging studies make use of limited datasets, therefore we believe that our contribution is particularly relevant to drive future developments of new medical imaging technologies when limited data are available. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Every year, maritime accidents cause severe damages not only to humans but also to maritime instruments like vessels. The authors of this work therefore propose a machine learning-based maritime accident prediction system that can be used to prevent maritime accidents from happening by predicting and interpreting the accidents. This work overcomes the limitations of the existing works that lack practicability in the sense that the ex-post analyses are conducted to suggest accident prevention strategies but maritime accidents are not analyzed holistically. Using extensive literature reviews and expert interviews, a large number of risk factors associated with maritime accidents are identified, and related data are collected and utilized in the work. Throughout variable selection, data retrieval, hot-spot identification, and the maritime accident prediction model construction process, various machine learning algorithms are exploited in order to construct an organized system. In addition, interpretations for the resulting accident predictions are given using interpretable machine learning algorithms so as to provide explainable results to users. Finally, the proposed system is evaluated using a SERVQUAL model and proves its effectiveness in real-world applications. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Seismic vulnerability assessment empowers decision-makers to develop effective earthquake mitigation strategies. In the past few decades, numerous empirical and analytical seismic vulnerability methods have been proposed; among which is the Hassan-Sozen Priority Index (PI). The PI is a very simple and popular metric for the seismic vulnerability of low-rise reinforced concrete buildings based on a linear combination of only the geometric dimensions of a building such as the floor area and the size of the lateral force resisting elements. This simplicity makes the PI a useful preliminary screening tool, but its accuracy and reliability are limited and questionable since the index oversimplifies the relationship between the dimensions of the building and its potential damage rating. Moreover, the performance of the PI has only been validated using a small set of post-earthquake reconnaissance data. State-of-the-art machine learning techniques make it possible to efficiently fit large and complex datasets which opens the door for the development of more advanced seismic vulnerability assessment methodologies. In this study, a large volume of post-earthquake reconnaissance data is gathered and an ensemble supervised learning approach (Random Forest) is implemented to develop a robust model that can relate the PI input parameters to building damage rating. Additionally, a Shapley Additive explanations (SHAP) method is exploited to validate and explain the models and conduct model transparency analysis. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - An essential component of the educational activity is rigorous examination and assessment of students' results, with a potential substantial influence on student growth. This paper offers a predictional model for student's success in secondary education using five classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, and Naive Bayes, where the data is gathered from two Portuguese school reports and surveys. The two core disciplines (Mathematics subject and Portuguese language) of the dataset were modeled around binary/five-level classification tasks which is imbalanced. The imbalanced dataset is also balanced by using K-Means SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) before classification. The test results reveal that obtaining the most outstanding accuracy value is 96.89% of Support Vector Machine (SVM) is superior to Logistic Regression, KNN, XG-Boost, and Naive Bayes. Therefore, it is essential to consider whether a model makes a particular prediction. Thus, we then train an interpretable LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) model for all the classifiers and the construction of explainable models can have a major advantage: the model can be confident, the transparency of the model helps to understand the underlying processes for working. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In contrast to the threats to urban human health, impacts of air pollutants on the ecosystem photosynthesis seem to be less concerned. The existence of aerosols could promote photosynthesis by increasing the ratio of diffuse to direct solar radiation; on the contrary, ozone (O3) could inhibit photosynthesis, as it is detrimental to leaf stomata. However, it is unknown whether these two opposite impacts worldwide cancel each other out. In the current mainstream methods, earth system models may show conflicts with in situ experimental results due to their relatively coarse resolution. In virtue of satellite remote sensing and a global eddy covariance (EC) network, we studied ten years of data to explore the impacts of aerosol and O3 on photosynthesis by fitting an explainable machine learning model. The impacts of aerosol on gross primary productivity (GPP) were positive in many cases, yet very weak. By means of the nitrogen dioxide (NO2) to formaldehyde (HCHO) ratio, O3 was seen with positive impacts on photosynthesis under the NOx-sensitive regime, but the apparent positive impacts correlated with the plant phenology. Under the volatile organic compound (VOC)-sensitive regime, the impacts of O3 on GPP were not obvious, which was likely due to the prioritized depletion of O3 by NO2 and VOCs. The impacts of air pollutants depended on many factors and results varied case by case, but the overall net impacts were negative. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Vision-based online defect recognition can provide insights for laser welding quality control systems. Although the visual signal contains richer quality information than the one-dimensional signal, the quality features contained in the visual signal are more abstract. To improve the explainability of current convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for laser welding defect recognition (LWDR), a class activation mapping method based on multi-scale fusion features (CAM-MSFF) is proposed. In addition, a multi-scale features adaptive fusion method is proposed with three steps of feature squeeze, feature mapping, and feature recalibrating. In order to facilitate the learning and utilization of multi-scale features by the proposed method, supervisory information is applied to multiple scales. The experimental results show that the proposed CAM-MSFF method has higher accuracy and convergence speed than the conventional model. The results of the explainability tests show that the proposed method can provide a more accurate and human-comprehensible explanation of the model's decision basis. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the most sought-after innovations in the financial industry. However, with its growing popularity, there also is the call for AI-based models to be understandable and transparent. However, understandably explaining the inner mechanism of the algorithms and their interpretation is entirely audience-dependent. The established literature fails to match the increasing number of explainable AI (XAI) methods with the different stakeholders’ explainability needs. This study addresses this gap by exploring how various stakeholders within the Swiss financial industry view explainability in their respective contexts. Based on a series of interviews with practitioners within the financial industry, we provide an in-depth review and discussion of their view on the potential and limitation of current XAI techniques needed to address the different requirements for explanations. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - We present a novel and computationally efficient method for the detection of meniscal tears in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data. Our method is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that operates on complete 3D MRI scans. Our approach detects the presence of meniscal tears in three anatomical sub-regions (anterior horn, body, posterior horn) for both the Medial Meniscus (MM) and the Lateral Meniscus (LM) individually. For optimal performance of our method, we investigate how to preprocess the MRI data and how to train the CNN such that only relevant information within a Region of Interest (RoI) of the data volume is taken into account for meniscal tear detection. We propose meniscal tear detection combined with a bounding box regressor in a multi-task deep learning framework to let the CNN implicitly consider the corresponding RoIs of the menisci. We evaluate the accuracy of our CNN-based meniscal tear detection approach on 2,399 Double Echo Steady-State (DESS) MRI scans from the Osteoarthritis Initiative database. In addition, to show that our method is capable of generalizing to other MRI sequences, we also adapt our model to Intermediate-Weighted Turbo Spin-Echo (IW TSE) MRI scans. To judge the quality of our approaches, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and Area Under the Curve (AUC) values are evaluated for both MRI sequences. For the detection of tears in DESS MRI, our method reaches AUC values of 0.94, 0.93, 0.93 (anterior horn, body, posterior horn) in MM and 0.96, 0.94, 0.91 in LM. For the detection of tears in IW TSE MRI data, our method yields AUC values of 0.84, 0.88, 0.86 in MM and 0.95, 0.91, 0.90 in LM. In conclusion, the presented method achieves high accuracy for detecting meniscal tears in both DESS and IW TSE MRI data. Furthermore, our method can be easily trained and applied to other MRI sequences. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The field of digital histopathology has seen incredible growth in recent years. Digital pathology is becoming a relevant tool in healthcare, industrial and research sectors to reduce the saturation of pathology departments and improve the productivity of pathologists by increasing diagnostic accuracy and reducing turnaround times. Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms may be used for the identification of relevant regions, extraction of features from a histological image and overall classification of images into specific classes. The combination of digital histopathology imaging and AI therefore presents a significant opportunity for the support of the pathologists' tasks and opens up a whole new world of computational analysis. In this paper, we have analysed the present, the challenges and the future of the computational pathology discussing the different existing strategies to overcome its main limitations and ensure the computational pathology acceptance. The lack of labelled data, which is the possibly largest challenge for all medical AI applications, is even more pronounced in computational pathology because of the multi-gigapixel nature of the images and high data heterogeneity. We consider the future of the computational pathology is the combination of weak label strategies with active learning and crowdsourcing scenarios since it would remove some of the workload from clinical experts and manual annotation obtaining clinically satisfactory performance with minimal annotation effort. In addition, we believe areas such as explainable AI, data fusion and secure role-based data sharing will be receiving increasing research attention in computational pathology in the close future. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The dynamic nature and increasing complexity of the construction industry have led to increased conflicts in construction projects. An accurate prediction of the outcome of a dispute resolution in courts could effectively reduce the number of disputes that would otherwise conclude by spending more money through litigation. This study aims to introduce a two-layered fuzzy logic model for predicting court decisions in construction contract disputes. 100 cases of construction contract disputes are selected from the courts of Iran. A questionnaire survey is then conducted to extract a set of fuzzy rules for identifying important decision parameters and expert knowledge. Accordingly, a two-layered fuzzy logic-based decision-making architecture is proposed for the prediction model. Furthermore, the fuzzy system is trained based on 10-fold cross-validation. Analysis of results indicates that 51 out of the 100 cases are filed after the dissolution and termination of the contract show a significant impact of these clauses as the root cause in construction contract disputes. Our results present a proposed hierarchical fuzzy system that can correctly predict nearly 60% of the test data. Also, we demonstrate a methodology of using argument before ML to establish interpretable AI models. Based on our findings, a fuzzy model with a hierarchical structure may be used as a simple and efficient method for predicting court decisions in construction contract disputes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Studies on manufacturing cost prediction based on deep learning have begun in recent years, but the cost prediction rationale cannot be explained because the models are still used as a black box. This study aims to propose a manufacturing cost prediction process for 3D computer-aided design (CAD) models using explainable artificial intelligence. The proposed process can visualize the machining features of the 3D CAD model that are influencing the increase in manufacturing costs. The proposed process consists of (1) data collection and pre-processing, (2) 3D deep learning architecture exploration, and (3) visualization to explain the prediction results. The proposed deep learning model shows high predictability of manufacturing cost for the computer numerical control (CNC) machined parts. In particular, using 3D gradient-weighted class activation mapping proves that the proposed model not only can detect the CNC machining features but also can differentiate the machining difficulty for the same feature. Using the proposed process, we can provide a design guidance to engineering designers in reducing manufacturing costs during the conceptual design phase. We can also provide real-time quotations and redesign proposals to online manufacturing platform customers. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Abstract: A large-scale review and analysis of the existing methods and approaches to extract rules from artificial neural networks, including deep learning neural networks, is carried out. A wide range of methods and approaches to extract rules and related approaches to develop explainable artificial intelligence (AI) systems are considered. The taxonomy and several directions in studies of explainable neural networks related to the extraction of rules from neural networks, which allow the user to get an idea of how the neural network uses the input data, and also, using rules, to reveal the hidden relationships of the input data and the results found, are explored. This review focuses on the relationship of the most common rule-based explanation systems in AI with the most powerful machine learning algorithms using neural networks. In addition to rule extraction, other methods of constructing explainable AI systems are considered based on the construction of special modules that interpret each step of changing the neural network’s weights. A comprehensive analysis of the existing research makes it possible to draw conclusions about the appropriateness of using certain approaches. The results of the analysis will allow us to get a detailed picture of the state of research in this area and create our own applications based on neural networks, the results of which can be studied in detail and their reliability evaluated. The development of such systems is necessary for the development of the digital economy in Russia and the creation of applications that allow making responsible and explainable management decisions in critical areas of the national economy. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This article demonstrates the use of data mining methods for evidence-based smart decision support in quality control. The data were collected in a measurement campaign which provided a new and potential quality measurement approach for manufacturing process planning and control. In this study, the machine learning prediction models and Explainable AI methods (XAI) serve as a base for the decision support system for smart manufacturing. The discovered information about the root causes behind the predicted failure can be used to improve the quality, and it also enables the definition of suitable security boundaries for better settings of the production parameters. The user’s need defines the given type of information. The developed method is applied to the monitoring of the surface roughness of the stainless steel strip, but the framework is not application dependent. The modeling analysis reveals that the parameters of the annealing and pickling line (RAP) have the best potential for real-time roughness improvement. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - By providing explanations for users and system designers to facilitate better understanding and decision making, explainable recommendation has been an important research problem. In this paper, we propose Counterfactual Explainable Recommendation (CountER), which takes the insights of counterfactual reasoning from causal inference for explainable recommendation. CountER is able to formulate the complexity and the strength of explanations, and it adopts a counterfactual learning framework to seek simple (low complexity) and effective (high strength) explanations for the model decision. Technically, for each item recommended to each user, CountER formulates a joint optimization problem to generate minimal changes on the item aspects so as to create a counterfactual item, such that the recommendation decision on the counterfactual item is reversed. These altered aspects constitute the explanation of why the original item is recommended. The counterfactual explanation helps both the users for better understanding and the system designers for better model debugging. Another contribution of the work is the evaluation of explainable recommendation, which has been a challenging task. Fortunately, counterfactual explanations are very suitable for standard quantitative evaluation. To measure the explanation quality, we design two types of evaluation metrics, one from user's perspective (i.e. why the user likes the item), and the other from model's perspective (i.e. why the item is recommended by the model). We apply our counterfactual learning algorithm on a black-box recommender system and evaluate the generated explanations on five real-world datasets. Results show that our model generates more accurate and effective explanations than state-of-the-art explainable recommendation models.

AB  - Following the emergence of cryptocurrencies, the field of digital assets experienced a sudden explosion of interest among institutional investors. However, regarding ICOs, there were a lot of scams involving the disappearance of firms after they had collected significant amounts of funds. We study how well one can predict if an offering will turn out to be a scam, doing so based on the characteristics known ex-ante. We therefore examine which of these characteristics are the most important predictors of a scam, and how they influence the probability of a scam. We use detailed data with 160 features from about 300 ICOs that took place before March 2018 and succeeded in raising most of their required capital. Various machine learning algorithms are applied together with novel XAI tools in order to identify the most important predictors of an offering’s failure and understand the shape of relationships. It turns out that based on the features known ex-ante, one can predict a scam with an accuracy of about 65–70%, and that nonlinear machine learning models perform better than traditional logistic regression and its regularized extensions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In the automotive industry, cost estimation of components to be purchased plays an important role for price negotiations with suppliers and, therefore, for cost control within the supply chain. While traditional bottom-up cost estimation is a very time consuming and know-how intensive process, intelligent machine learning methods have the potential to significantly reduce the effort in the cost estimation process. In this paper, a literature review on intelligent cost estimation methods for parts to be procured in the manufacturing industry is carried out by text mining. Following the results of this literature review, building blocks for an intelligent cost estimation system are outlined that comprise cost estimation methods, dimensionality reduction methods, methods for multi-level cost estimation, and methods for interpreting the results of the cost analysis. Regarding cost estimation methods, Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines outperform established linear regression algorithms. Dimensionality reduction methods like Correlation Analysis or Principal Component Analysis are rarely studied. Nevertheless, they contribute a lot to the reduction of expensively provided input parameters for cost estimation. Methods for multi-level cost estimation, that support cost prediction of parts and assemblies following the construction plan of a vehicle, and methods for interpretation of intelligent cost analytics cannot be found at all in literature. Consequently, in this paper corresponding approaches are derived from the areas of Multitask Learning and Explainable Machine Learning. Finally, a combination of methods considered most suitable for predictive analytics to estimate procurement costs is presented. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The sudden outbreak and uncontrolled spread of COVID-19 disease is one of the most important global problems today. In a short period of time, it has led to the development of many deep neural network models for COVID-19 detection with modules for explainability. In this work, we carry out a systematic analysis of various aspects of proposed models. Our analysis revealed numerous mistakes made at different stages of data acquisition, model development, and explanation construction. In this work, we overview the approaches proposed in the surveyed Machine Learning articles and indicate typical errors emerging from the lack of deep understanding of the radiography domain. We present the perspective of both: experts in the field - radiologists and deep learning engineers dealing with model explanations. The final result is a proposed checklist with the minimum conditions to be met by a reliable COVID-19 diagnostic model. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Organizations depend on heavy use of various cyber defense technologies, including intrusion detection and prevention systems, to monitor and protect networks and devices from malicious activities. However, large volumes of false alerts from such technologies challenge cybersecurity analysts in isolating credible alerts from false positives for further investigations. In this article, we propose a framework named FAIXID that leverages Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and data cleaning methods for improving the explainability and understandability of intrusion detection alerts, which in turn assist cyber analysts in making more informed decisions fueled by the quick elimination of false positives. We identified five functional modules in FAIXID: (1) the pre-modeling explainability module that improves the quality of network traffic’s data through data cleaning; (2) the modeling module that provides explanations of the AI models to help analysts make sense of the model internals; (3) the post-modeling explainability module that provides additional explanations to enhance the understandability of the results produced by the AI models; (4) the attribution module that selects the appropriate explanations for the analysts according to their needs; and (5) the evaluation module that evaluates the explanations and collects feedback from analysts. FAIXID has been implemented and evaluated using experiments with real-world datasets. Evaluation of results demonstrates that the utilization of data cleaning and AI explainability techniques provide quality explanations to analysts depending on their expertise and backgrounds. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With Artificial Intelligence becoming part of a rapidly increasing number of industrial applications, more and more requirements about their transparency and trustworthiness are being demanded to AI systems, especially in military, medical and financial domains, where decisions have a huge impact on lives. In this paper, we propose a novel model-agnostic Explainable AI (XAI) technique, named Cluster-aided Space Transformation for Local Explanation (CASTLE), able to provide rule-based explanations based on both the local and global model's workings, i.e. its detailed ”knowledge” in the neighborhood of the target instance and its general knowledge on the training dataset, respectively. The framework has been evaluated on six datasets in terms of temporal efficiency, cluster quality and model significance. Eventually, we asked 36 users to evaluate the explainability of the framework, getting as result an increase of interpretability of 6% with respect to another state-of-the-art technique, named Anchors. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In spite of enormous improvements in vehicle safety, roadway design, and operations, there is still an excessive amount of traffic crashes resulting in injuries and major productivity losses. Despite the many studies on factors of crash frequency and injury severity, there is still further research to be conducted. Tree and utility pole/other pole related (TUOP) crashes present approximately 12 to 15% of all roadway departure (RwD) fatal crashes in the U.S. The count of TUOP crashes comprise nearly 22% of all fatal crashes in Louisiana. From 2010 to 2016, there were 55,857 TUOP crashes reported in Louisiana. Individually examining each of these crash reports is not a realistic option to investigate crash factors. Therefore, this study employed text mining and interpretable machine learning (IML) techniques to analyze all TUOP crashes (with available crash narratives) that occurred in Louisiana from 2010 to 2016. This study has two major goals: 1) to develop a framework for applying machine learning models to classify injury levels from unstructured textual content, and 2) to apply an IML framework that provides probability measures of keywords and their association with the injury classification. The present study employed three machine learning algorithms in the classification of injury levels based on the crash narrative data. Of the used modeling techniques, the eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model shows better performance, with accuracy ranging from 0.70 to 24% for the training data and from 0.30% to 16% for the test data. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In a Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) system, images are retrieved based on the content of the images such as color, shapes and objects. However, often end users experience a semantic gap between the notion of similarity used by the ranking model versus the users' perception about image similarity. Explainable AI (XAI) is an emerging research field that attempts to provide transparency of 'black box' models, to make AI systems trustworthy and gain user trust. This work aims at building an I mage R etrieval system with T extual EX planations such as 'The (global) results are similar to the query by X% due to shape, Y% due to color'. Local explanations are generated using various methods such as comparing images with respect to overlap between low level features such as color, shape and regions (MPEG-7 features). Additionally, high level features such as background-foreground segmentation, deep learned features and major key-points, objects identified (SIFT features) are used to enrich the explanations. We evaluate the quality of rankings on benchmark data-sets such as PASCAL VOC. The XAI facet of user satisfaction and usefulness of the system is evaluated in a lab based user study. Our results show that the semantic gap is better bridged using high level features. While low level features might be better suited for re-ranking of the retrieved images. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The recent surge of interest in explainability in artificial intelligence (XAI) is propelled by not only technological advancements in machine learning but also by regulatory initiatives to foster transparency in algorithmic decision making. In this article, we revise the current concept of explainability and identify three limitations: passive explainee, narrow view on the social process, and undifferentiated assessment of explainee's understanding. In order to overcome these limitations, we present explanation as a social practice in which explainer and explainee co-construct understanding on the microlevel. We view the co-construction on a microlevel as embedded into a macrolevel, yielding expectations concerning, e.g., social roles or partner models: typically, the role of the explainer is to provide an explanation and to adapt it to the current level of explainee's understanding; the explainee, in turn, is expected to provide cues that direct the explainer. Building on explanations being a social practice, we present a conceptual framework that aims to guide future research in XAI. The framework relies on the key concepts of monitoring and scaffolding to capture the development of interaction. We relate our conceptual framework and our new perspective on explaining to transparency and autonomy as objectives considered for XAI. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A wide range of code intelligence (CI) tools, powered by deep neural networks, have been developed recently to improve programming productivity and perform program analysis. To reliably use such tools, developers often need to reason about the behavior of the underlying models and the factors that affect them. This is especially challenging for tools backed by deep neural networks. Various methods have tried to reduce this opacity in the vein of "transparent/interpretable-AI". However, these approaches are often specific to a particular set of network architectures, even requiring access to the network's parameters. This makes them difficult to use for the average programmer, which hinders the reliable adoption of neural CI systems. In this paper, we propose a simple, model-agnostic approach to identify critical input features for models in CI systems, by drawing on software debugging research, specifically delta debugging. Our approach, SIVAND, uses simplification techniques that reduce the size of input programs of a CI model while preserving the predictions of the model. We show that this approach yields remarkably small outputs and is broadly applicable across many model architectures and problem domains. We find that the models in our experiments often rely heavily on just a few syntactic features in input programs. We believe that SIVAND's extracted features may help understand neural CI systems' predictions and learned behavior. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper introduces a new high-performance machine learning tool named Silas, which is built to provide a more transparent, dependable and efficient data analytics service. We discuss the machine learning aspects of Silas and demonstrate the advantage of Silas in its predictive and computational performance. We show that several customised algorithms in Silas yield better predictions in a significantly shorter time compared to the state-of-the-art. Another focus of Silas is on providing a formal foundation of decision trees to support logical analysis and verification of learned prediction models. We illustrate the potential capabilities of the fusion of machine learning and logical reasoning by showcasing applications in three directions: formal verification of the prediction model against user specifications, training correct-by-construction models, and explaining the decision-making of predictions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - It has been long debated that eXplainable AI (XAI) is an important technology for model and data exploration, validation, and debugging. To deploy XAI into actual systems, an executable and comprehensive evaluation of the quality of generated explanation is highly in demand. In this paper, we briefly summarize the status quo of the quantitative metrics of different properties of XAI including evaluation on faithfulness, localization, sensitivity check, and stability. With an exhaustive experimental study based on them, we conclude that among all the typical methods we compare, no single explanation method dominates others in all metrics. Nonetheless, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and Randomly Input Sampling for Explanation (RISE) perform fairly well in most of the metrics. We further present a novel utilization of the evaluation results to diagnose the classification bases for models. Hopefully, this valuable work could serve as a guide for future research. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Decrease in crop yield and degradation in product quality due to plant diseases such as rust and blast in pearl millet is the cause of concern for farmers and the agriculture industry. The stipulation of expert advice for disease identification is also a challenge for the farmers. The traditional techniques adopted for plant disease detection require more human intervention, are unhandy for farmers, and have a high cost of deployment, operation, and maintenance. Therefore, there is a requirement for automating plant disease detection and classification. Deep learning and IoT-based solutions are proposed in the literature for plant disease detection and classification. However, there is a huge scope to develop low-cost systems by integrating these techniques for data collection, feature visualization, and disease detection. This research aims to develop the ‘Automatic and Intelligent Data Collector and Classifier’ framework by integrating IoT and deep learning. The framework automatically collects the imagery and parametric data from the pearl millet farmland at ICAR, Mysore, India. It automatically sends the collected data to the cloud server and the Raspberry Pi. The ‘Custom-Net’ model designed as a part of this research is deployed on the cloud server. It collaborates with the Raspberry Pi to precisely predict the blast and rust diseases in pearl millet. Moreover, the Grad-CAM is employed to visualize the features extracted by the ‘Custom-Net’. Furthermore, the impact of transfer learning on the ‘Custom-Net’ and state-of-the-art models viz. Inception ResNet-V2, Inception-V3, ResNet-50, VGG-16, and VGG-19 is shown in this manuscript. Based on the experimental results, and features visualization by Grad-CAM, it is observed that the ‘Custom-Net’ extracts the relevant features and the transfer learning improves the extraction of relevant features. Additionally, the ‘Custom-Net’ model reports a classification accuracy of 98.78% that is equivalent to state-of-the-art models viz. Inception ResNet-V2, Inception-V3, ResNet-50, VGG-16, and VGG-19. Although the classification of ‘Custom-Net’ is comparable to state-of-the-art models, it is effective in reducing the training time by 86.67%. It makes the model more suitable for automating disease detection. This proves that the proposed model is effective in providing a low-cost and handy tool for farmers to improve crop yield and product quality. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The logic of an artificial intelligence (AI) model derived from machine learning algorithms and domain-specific data is analogous to an expert's perception of a complex problem. Human insight based on know-how and experience also provides the best clue to verify such analytical models generalized from data. To facilitate the acceptance and implementation of AI by industry professionals, we explored the least complicated form of model that still is sufficient to represent the complexities of real-world problems. This research established a framework to apply the M5P model tree in the context of producing explainable AI for practical applications. The explanatory information derived from M5P (a decision tree with linear regressions at leaf nodes) is instrumental in explaining how the more complicated AI model reasons for the same problem, illuminating the sufficiency of problem definition and data quality, and distinguishing valid submodels from invalid ones in the obtained model tree. A steel fabrication labor cost-estimating case and a concrete strength development case were given for method validation and application demonstration. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Manufacturing quality control (QC) in plastic injection moulding is of the upmost importance since almost one third of plastic products are manufactured via the injection moulding process. Moreover, smart manufacturing technologies are enabling the generation of huge amounts of data in production lines. This data can be used for predicting the quality of manufactured plastic products using machine learning methods, allowing companies to save costs and improve their production efficiency. However, high-performance machine learning models are usually too complicated to be understood by human intuition. Therefore, we have introduced a rule-based explanations (RBE) framework that combines several machine learning interpretation methods to help to understand the decision mechanisms of accurate and complex predictive models – specifically tree ensemble models. These generated rules can be used to visually and easily understand the main factors that affect the quality in the manufacturing process. To demonstrate the applicability of RBE, we present two experiments with real industrial data gathered from a plastic injection moulding machine in a Singapore model factory. The collected datasets contain condition data for several manufacturing processes as well as the QC results for sink mark defects in the production of small plastic products. The experiments revealed that it is possible to extract meaningful explanations in the form of simple decision rules that are enhanced with partial dependence plots and feature importance rankings for a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms and data relationships of accurate tree ensembles. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Flat slabs, despite their aesthetic qualities and widespread use in construction, are susceptible to brittle shear failure. In addition, although design provisions are available, they are often associated with high bias and variance. This study evaluates the efficiency of machine learning-based approaches in establishing accurate prediction models for the punching shear strength of flat slabs without transverse reinforcement. To this end, 380 experimental results from various literature are assembled in this study. In addition to linear regression, seven machine learning methods as ridge regression, support vector regression, decision tree, K-nearest neighbors, random forest, adaptive boosting, and extreme gradient boosting—are considered in this study to obtain the best prediction model for the punching shear strength of flat slabs. Based on random assignment of the data into training and test sets and a performance evaluation of the test set, the extreme gradient boosting model is shown to have the highest coefficient of determination and lowest mean square error estimate. The superior performance of this machine learning model is further underscored through comparison of its shear strength predictions with those of existing code provisions and empirical models. It is noted that the extreme gradient boosting model has a coefficient of determination of 0.98, and the associated coefficient of variation is 0.09. This study also employs the SHapley Additive exPlanation method to explain the importance and contribution of the factors that influence the punching shear strength in the extreme gradient boosting model. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The results of evaluating explanations of the black-box model for prediction are presented. The XAI evaluation is realized through the different principles and characteristics between black-box model explanations and XAI labels. In the field of high-dimensional prediction, the black-box model represented by neural network and ensemble models can predict complex data sets more accurately than traditional linear regression and white-box models such as the decision tree model. However, an unexplainable characteristic not only hinders developers from debugging but also causes users mistrust. In the XAI field dedicated to 'opening' the black box model, effective evaluation methods are still being developed. Within the established XAI evaluation framework (MDMC) in this paper, explanation methods for the prediction can be effectively tested, and the identified explanation method with relatively higher quality can improve the accuracy, transparency, and reliability of prediction. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Many real-world applications involve data from multiple modalities and thus exhibit the view heterogeneity. For example, user modeling on social media might leverage both the topology of the underlying social network and the content of the users' posts; in the medical domain, multiple views could be X-ray images taken at different poses. To date, various techniques have been proposed to achieve promising results, such as canonical correlation analysis based methods, etc. In the meanwhile, it is critical for decision-makers to be able to understand the prediction results from these methods. For example, given the diagnostic result that a model provided based on the X-ray images of a patient at different poses, the doctor needs to know why the model made such a prediction. However, state-of-the-art techniques usually suffer from the inability to utilize the complementary information of each view and to explain the predictions in an interpretable manner. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a deep co-attention network for multi-view subspace learning, which aims to extract both the common information and the complementary information in an adversarial setting and provide robust interpretations behind the prediction to the end-users via the co-attention mechanism. In particular, it uses a novel cross reconstruction loss and leverages the label information to guide the construction of the latent representation by incorporating the classifier into our model. This improves the quality of latent representation and accelerates the convergence speed. Finally, we develop an efficient iterative algorithm to find the optimal encoders and discriminator, which are evaluated extensively on synthetic and real-world data sets. We also conduct a case study to demonstrate how the proposed method robustly interprets the predictions on an image data set. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this article, the authors construct a pipeline to benchmark hierarchical risk parity (HRP) relative to equal risk contribution (ERC) as examples of diversification strategies allocating to liquid multi-asset futures markets with dynamic leverage (volatility target). The authors use interpretable machine learning concepts (explainable AI) to compare the robustness of the strategies and to back out implicit rules for decision-making. The empirical dataset consists of 17 equity index, government bond, and commodity futures markets across 20 years. The two strategies are back tested for the empirical dataset and for about 100,000 bootstrapped datasets. XGBoost is used to regress the Calmar ratio spread between the two strategies against features of the bootstrapped datasets. Compared to ERC, HRP shows higher Calmar ratios and better matches the volatility target. Using Shapley values, the Calmar ratio spread can be attributed especially to univariate drawdown measures of the asset classes. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background and objective: Patients who survive sepsis in the intensive care unit (ICU) (sepsis survivors) have an increased risk of long-term mortality and ICU readmission. We aim to identify the risk factors for in-hospital mortality in sepsis survivors with later ICU readmission and visualize the quantitative relationship between the individual risk factors and mortality by applying machine learning (ML) algorithm. Methods: Data were obtained from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database for sepsis and non-sepsis ICU survivors who were later readmitted to the ICU. The data on the first day of ICU readmission and the in-hospital mortality was combined for the ML algorithm modeling and the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value of the correlation between the risk factors and the outcome. Results: Among the 2970 enrolled patients, in-hospital mortality during ICU readmission was significantly higher in sepsis survivors (n = 2228) than nonsepsis survivors (n = 742) (50.4% versus 30.7%, P<0.001). The ML algorithm identified 18 features that were associated with a risk of mortality in these groups; among these, BUN, age, weight, and minimum heart rate were shared by both groups, and the remaining mean systolic pressure, urine output, albumin, platelets, lactate, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), potassium, pCO2, pO2, respiration rate, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score for eye-opening, anion gap, sex and temperature were specific to previous sepsis survivors. The ML algorithm also calculated the quantitative contribution and noteworthy threshold of each factor to the risk of mortality in sepsis survivors. Conclusion: 14 specific parameters with corresponding thresholds were found to be associated with the in-hospital mortality of sepsis survivors during the ICU readmission. The construction of advanced ML techniques could support the analysis and development of predictive models that can be used to support the decisions and treatment strategies made in a clinical setting in critical care patients. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Data science (DS) projects often follow a lifecycle that consists of laborious tasks for data scientists and domain experts (e.g., data exploration, model training, etc.). Only till recently, machine learning(ML) researchers have developed promising automation techniques to aid data workers in these tasks. This paper introduces AutoDS, an automated machine learning (AutoML) system that aims to leverage the latest ML automation techniques to support data science projects. Data workers only need to upload their dataset, then the system can automatically suggest ML confgurations, preprocess data, select algorithm, and train the model. These suggestions are presented to the user via a web-based graphical user interface and a notebook-based programming user interface. Our goal is to offer a systematic investigation of user interaction and perceptions of using an AutoDS system in solving a data science task. We studied AutoDS with 30 professional data scientists, where one group used AutoDS, and the other did not, to complete a data science project. As expected, AutoDS improves productivity; Yet surprisingly, we fnd that the models produced by the AutoDS group have higher quality and less errors, but lower human confdence scores. We refect on the fndings by presenting design implications for incorporating automation techniques into human work in the data science lifecycle. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Learnersourcing is emerging as a viable learner-centred and pedagogically justified approach for harnessing the creativity and evaluation power of learners as experts-in-training. Despite the increasing adoption of learnersourcing in higher education, understanding students' behaviour while engaged in learnersourcing and best practices for the design and development of learnersourcing systems are still largely under-researched. This paper offers data-driven reflections and lessons learned from the development and deployment of a learnersourcing adaptive educational system called RiPPLE, which to date, has been used in more than 50-course offerings with over 12,000 students. Our reflections are categorised into examples and best practices on (1) assessing the quality of students' contributions using accurate, explainable and fair approaches to data analysis, (2) incentivising students to develop high-quality contributions and (3) empowering instructors with actionable and explainable insights to guide student learning. We discuss the implications of these findings and how they may contribute to the growing literature on the development of effective learnersourcing systems and more broadly technological educational solutions that support learner-centred learning at scale. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The broader ambition of this article is to popularize an approach for the fair distribution of the quantity of a system’s output to its subsystems while allowing for underlying complex subsystem level interactions. Particularly, we present the use of this framework on a very specific (but generalizable) application, interesting for a more general AI audience. We detail a data-driven approach to vehicle price modeling and its component price estimation by leveraging a combination of concepts from machine learning and game theory. We show an alternative to common teardown methodologies and surveying approaches for component and vehicle price estimation at the manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP) level that has the advantage of bypassing uncertainties involved in gathering teardown data, the need to perform expensive and biased surveying, and the need to perform retail price equivalent or indirect cost multiplier adjustments to mark up direct manufacturing costs to MSRP. This novel exercise not only provides accurate pricing of the technologies at the customer level, but also shows the, a priori known, large gaps in pricing strategies between manufacturers, vehicle classes, market segments, etc. There is also clear interaction between the price of technologies and other specifications present in vehicles. Those results are indication that old methods of manufacturer-level component costing, aggregation, and application of flat and rigid adjustment factors should be carefully examined. The findings are based on a database developed by Argonne, which includes over 64 000 vehicles covering MY1990 to MY2020 with hundreds of vehicle specs. Impact Statement—The U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Vehicle Technologies Office aims to develop sustainable, affordable, and efficient technologies for transportation of goods and people. Translating investments in advanced transportation technologies and powertrains to estimate vehicle-level fuel and cost savings potential is critical for understanding DOE’s impact. Because of the large number of advanced vehicle and powertrain technologies, researchers and automotive manufacturers have been relying on system simulation to quantify the impact of new technologies. The rapid evolution and introduction of technologies necessitate models and costs to be continuously updated. We explore a potential novel approach to update the current pricing methodologies to support future techno-economic analysis using a data-driven interpretable machine learning approach. Using an unusual top-down approach for vehicle and component pricing—from vehicle retail price estimation using machine learning techniques down to component price attributional effects on MSRP—by leveraging game theory concepts of coalition and cooperation. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A new round of scientific and technological change and industrial transformation is emerging. Based on deep learning and big data, a third achievement of artificial intelligence is represented by AlphaGo and other typical application scenarios. When dealing with complex dynamic objects, the traditional artificial intelligence based on statistical linear dynamic modeling experiences bottlenecks related to interpretability, generalization, and reproducibility. It is urgent that a new generation of artificial intelligence theory be established that is based on complexity and multi-scale analysis, which we refer to as refined intelligence. To deal with the non-linearity of complex systems, we constructed a systems learning theory of embedded domain knowledge and a mathematical physical mechanism that is accurate and intelligent at three performance levels: complex data perception, complex system refined construction, and complex intelligent behavior analysis. Specifically, we built a scientific data system with interpretability, including embedded spatiotemporal characteristics and mathematical laws, through complex data perception. We also built a multi-level, multi-scale, and interpretable artificial intelligence dynamic learning model that can deal with the nonlinear relationship of complex logic based on complex system-defined construction. We developed a new theory and method for interpreting and controlling the evolution of artificial intelligence- oriented behavior and global dynamic analysis based on complex intelligent-behavior analysis. We applied the above refined intelligence theory to the proposed method for crowd intelligence with crowd entropy, and found that it can measure complexity and provide effective guidance regarding system stimulation and aggregation behavior. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this article, the authors present a novel and highly flexible concept to simulate correlation matrixes of financial markets. It produces realistic outcomes regarding stylized facts of empirical correlation matrixes and requires no asset return input data. The matrix generation is based on a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm, so the authors call the approach matrix evolutions. It is suitable for parallel implementation and can be accelerated by graphics processing units and quantum-inspired algorithms. The approach is useful for backtesting, pricing, and hedging correlation-dependent investment strategies and financial products. Its potential is demonstrated in a machine learning case study for robust portfolio construction in a multi-asset universe: An explainable machine learning program links the synthetic matrixes to the portfolio volatility spread of hierarchical risk parity versus equal risk contribution. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In an ever-increasing interest for Machine Learning (ML) and a favorable data development context, we here propose an original methodology for data-based prediction of two-dimensional physical fields. Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE), widely used in the Uncertainty Quantification community (UQ), has long been employed as a robust representation for probabilistic input-to-output mapping. It has been recently tested in a pure ML context, and shown to be as powerful as classical ML techniques for point-wise prediction. Some advantages are inherent to the method, such as its explicitness and adaptability to small training sets, in addition to the associated probabilistic framework. Simultaneously, Dimensionality Reduction (DR) techniques are increasingly used for pattern recognition and data compression and have gained interest due to improved data quality. In this study, the interest of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) for the construction of a statistical predictive model is demonstrated. Both POD and PCE have amply proved their worth in their respective frameworks. The goal of the present paper was to combine them for a field-measurement-based forecasting. The described steps are also useful to analyze the data. Some challenging issues encountered when using multidimensional field measurements are addressed, for example when dealing with few data. The POD-PCE coupling methodology is presented, with particular focus on input data characteristics and training-set choice. A simple methodology for evaluating the importance of each physical parameter is proposed for the PCE model and extended to the POD-PCE coupling. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Ridesharing is critical for promoting transportation sustainability. As a new form of ridesharing services, ridesplitting has rarely been studied. Based on the Chicago ridesourcing trip data, this study explores how ridesplitting adoption rate (i.e., the proportion of ridesourcing trips with ridesharing authorization) varies across space and what factors are associated with these variations. We find large variations in ridesplitting adoption rates across neighborhoods (Census Tracts) and across origin–destination (Census-Tract-to-Census-Tract) pairs. Particularly, the ridesplitting adoption rate is low for airport rides. We further apply a random forest model to explore which factors are key predictors of ridesplitting adoption rate across O-D pairs and to explore their nonlinear associations. The results suggest that the socioeconomic and demographic variables collectively contribute to 68.60% of the predictive power of the model, but travel-cost variables and built-environment-related factors are also important. The most important variables associated with ridesplitting adoption are ethnic composition, median household income, education level, trip distance, and neighborhood density. We further examine the nonlinear association between neighborhood ridesplitting adoption rate and several key variables such as the percentage of white population, median household income, and neighborhood Walk Score. The revealed nonlinear patterns can help transportation professionals identify neighborhoods with the greatest potential to promote ridesplitting. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Evaluating local explanation methods is a difficult task due to the lack of a shared and universally accepted definition of explanation. In the literature, one of the most common ways to assess the performance of an explanation method is to measure the fidelity of the explanation with respect to the classification of a black box model adopted by an Artificial Intelligent system for making a decision. However, this kind of evaluation only measures the degree of adherence of the local explainer in reproducing the behavior of the black box classifier with respect to the final decision. Therefore, the explanation provided by the local explainer could be different in the content even though it leads to the same decision of the AI system. In this paper, we propose an approach that allows to measure to which extent the explanations returned by local explanation methods are correct with respect to a synthetic ground truth explanation. Indeed, the proposed methodology enables the generation of synthetic transparent classifiers for which the reason for the decision taken, i.e., a synthetic ground truth explanation, is available by design. Experimental results show how the proposed approach allows to easily evaluate local explanations on the ground truth and to characterize the quality of local explanation methods. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The wide adoption of Machine Learning (ML) technologies has created a growing demand for people who can train ML models. Some advocated the term "machine teacher'' to refer to the role of people who inject domain knowledge into ML models. This "teaching'' perspective emphasizes supporting the productivity and mental wellbeing of machine teachers through efficient learning algorithms and thoughtful design of human-AI interfaces. One promising learning paradigm is Active Learning (AL), by which the model intelligently selects instances to query a machine teacher for labels, so that the labeling workload could be largely reduced. However, in current AL settings, the human-AI interface remains minimal and opaque. A dearth of empirical studies further hinders us from developing teacher-friendly interfaces for AL algorithms. In this work, we begin considering AI explanations as a core element of the human-AI interface for teaching machines. When a human student learns, it is a common pattern to present one's own reasoning and solicit feedback from the teacher. When a ML model learns and still makes mistakes, the teacher ought to be able to understand the reasoning underlying its mistakes. When the model matures, the teacher should be able to recognize its progress in order to trust and feel confident about their teaching outcome. Toward this vision, we propose a novel paradigm of explainable active learning (XAL), by introducing techniques from the surging field of explainable AI (XAI) into an AL setting. We conducted an empirical study comparing the model learning outcomes, feedback content and experience with XAL, to that of traditional AL and coactive learning (providing the model's prediction without explanation). Our study shows benefits of AI explanation as interfaces for machine teaching - supporting trust calibration and enabling rich forms of teaching feedback, and potential drawbacks - anchoring effect with the model judgment and additional cognitive workload. Our study also reveals important individual factors that mediate a machine teacher's reception to AI explanations, including task knowledge, AI experience and Need for Cognition. By reflecting on the results, we suggest future directions and design implications for XAL, and more broadly, machine teaching through AI explanations. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Inventory represents the largest asset in pharmacy products distribution. Forecasting pharmacy purchases is essential to keep an effective stock balancing supply and demand besides minimizing costs. In this work, we investigate how to forecast product purchases for a pharmaceutical distributor. The data contains inventory sale histories for more than 10 thousand active products during the past 15 years. We discuss challenges on data preprocessing of the pharmacy data including cleaning, feature constructions and selections, as well as processing data during the COVID period. We experimented on different machine learning and deep learning neural network models to predict future purchases for each product, including classical Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA), Prophet from Facebook, linear regression, Random Forest, XGBoost and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). We demonstrate that a carefully designed SARIMA model outperformed the others on the task, and weekly prediction models perform better than daily predictions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) service costs are rapidly growing due to the higher resource utilization intensity. This in turn increases the healthcare costs for NICU patients besides the inaccessibility and unpreparedness of both NICU service providers and patient caretakers hence an increase in neonatal mortality and morbidity. There a lot of contributors to NICU admissions but the exiting methods consider very limited features to precisely predict NICU admissions. In this paper, we present a robust Explainable Artificial Intelligence approach that allows machines to interpretably learn from a pool of possible contributing features in order to predict an NICU admission. Our machine learning approach interpretably illustrates the thought process of admission prediction to the physician and patient. This provides transparent and trustable insights for the precise, proactive, personalized and participatory NICU medical diagnostics and treatment plans for the patient. We statistically and visually present Random Forest and Logistic Regression prediction explanations using SHAP, LIME and ELI5 techniques. This predictive technological approach can preventively increase success of maternal and neonatal monitoring and treatment plans. It can also enhance proactive management of NICU facilities (resources) by the responsible facility administrators most especially in resource constrained settings. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - There is an increasing demand for explainable models in various applications. We interleave here explanations generated both from black-box models and white-box models. To achieve this we employ (i) a local model-agnostic technique (LIME), (ii) a theoretic game approach (SHAP), (iii) an example-based explanation technique (ExMatchina), and (iv) a model-specific method (KTrain). The running scenario is to identify persons from images and to explain the algorithmic decision. First, we extract features from images in order to train a white-box model and deploy explanation methods that work with tabular data. Second, we take advantage of transfer learning and fine-tuning to train black-box models and deploy image-based explanations methods. We aim to increase the interpretability of the system by providing explanations. We use the results to determine whether or not decisions are valid or if explanations are viable. Although many explanations techniques have been developed, there are no appropriate performance metrics to evaluate them. We propose two metrics to evaluate explanations quality. Based on these metrics, we demonstrate that LIME is unstable as it generates different explanations for same instance at multiple runs. Advantages and disadvantages of explanations techniques are also discussed and a user-grounded evaluation is performed. The evaluation study reveals that several explanation techniques were pre-ferred by participants, followed by features listing, example-based explanations and pixels-based explanations. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In tunnel construction, heavy machinery like tunnel boring machines are used to increase the safety and efficiency of tunneling projects. Despite the fact that these machines are equipped with a variety of different sensors, human workers still operate both the advance and ring building phases of the machine. Due to the high complexity of handling segment erectors, the ring building phase in particular has a lot of room for improvement. In this work, a concept of a data-driven assistance system to support operators in the ring building process is proposed. Three approaches to extract human expertise from operational data of tunnel boring machines using machine learning and explainable artificial intelligence are presented and discussed. Furthermore, preliminary data preprocessing results verify that our approach of determining ring building times is more accurate compared to on-site measurements. This contribution highlights the untouched potential of ring building optimization using machine learning techniques based on real-world data. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The success of software engineering projects largely depends on complex decision-making. For example, which tasks should a developer do first, who should perform this task, is the software of high quality, is a software system reliable and resilient enough to deploy, etc. However, erroneous decision-making for these complex questions is costly in terms of money and reputation. Thus, Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) techniques have been widely used in software engineering for developing software analytics tools and techniques to improve decision-making, developer productivity, and software quality. However, the predictions of such AI/ML models for software engineering are still not practical (i.e., coarse-grained), not explainable, and not actionable. These concerns often hinder the adoption of AI/ML models in software engineering practices. In addition, many recent studies still focus on improving the accuracy, while a few of them focus on improving explainability. Are we moving in the right direction? How can we better improve the SE community (both research and education)?In this tutorial, we first provide a concise yet essential introduction to the most important aspects of Explainable AI and a hands-on tutorial of Explainable AI tools and techniques. Then, we introduce the fundamental knowledge of defect prediction (an example application of AI for Software Engineering). Finally, we demonstrate three successful case studies on how Explainable AI techniques can be used to address the aforementioned challenges by making the predictions of software defect prediction models more practical, explainable, and actionable.

AB  - Predictive maintenance is a prominent and active field for applications of machine learning in industry in recent years. The health and wear of equipment directly influences the productivity and quality of the production process. Especially in ultra-precision manufacturing, tool wear has a major impact on the achievable quality while the wear itself cannot be measured directly in-process. In this paper we present a machine learning-based classification of the tool wear in-process using acoustic emission sensors. To increase the interpretability of the process - to open the black box model - we apply a feature importance analysis and use the obtained feature importances to provide augmented data representations to the users. These representations increase the transparency of the model's decision process and assist the users in validating the model's decisions and gain new insight into the phenomenon of tool wear itself. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Vertical federated learning has a great potential of driving a great variety of business cooperation among enterprises in many fields. In machine learning, decision tree ensembles such as gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT) and random forest are widely applied powerful models with high interpretability and modeling efficiency. However, state-of-art framework for decision tree ensembles in vertical federated learning frameworks adapt anonymous features to avoid possible data breaches, makes the interpretability of the model compromised.To address this issue in the inference process, in this paper, we firstly make a problem analysis about the necessity of disclosure meanings of feature to Guest Party in vertical federated learning. We protect data privacy and allow the disclosure of feature meaning by concealing decision paths and adapt a communication-efficient secure computation method for inference outputs. The advantages of Fed-EINI will be demonstrated through both theoretical analysis and extensive numerical results. We improve the interpretability of the model by disclosing the meaning of features while ensuring efficiency and accuracy. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In many image-classification applications, understanding the reasons of model's prediction can be as critical as the prediction's accuracy itself. Various feature-based local explainers have been designed to provide explanations on the decision of complex classifiers. Nevertheless, there is no consensus on evaluating the quality of different explanations. In response to this lack of comprehensive evaluation, we introduce the c-Eval metric and its corresponding framework to quantify the feature-based local explanation's quality. Given a classifier's prediction and the corresponding explanation on that prediction, c-Eval is the minimum-distortion perturbation that successfully alters the prediction while keeping the explanation's features unchanged. To show that c-Eval captures the importance of input's features, we establish a connection between c-Eval and the features returned by explainers in affine and nearly-affine classifiers. We then introduce the c-Eval plot, which not only displays a strong connection between c-Eval and explainers' quality, but also helps automatically determine explainer's parameters. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Strategies based on Explainable Artificial Intelligence - XAI have emerged in computing to promote a better understanding of predictions made by black box models. Most XAI measures used today explain these types of models, generating attribute rankings aimed at explaining the model, that is, the analysis of Attribute Importance of Model. There is no consensus on which XAI measure generates an overall explainability rank. For this reason, several proposals for tools have emerged (Ciu, Dalex, Eli5, Lofo, Shap and Skater). An experimental benchmark of explainable AI techniques capable of producing global explainability ranks based on tabular data related to different problems and ensemble models are presented herein. Seeking to answer questions such as "Are the explanations generated by the different measures the same, similar or different?"and "How does data complexity play along model explainability?"The results from the construction of 82 computational models and 592 ranks shed some light on the other side of the problem of explainability: dataset complexity! © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, we proposed a novel Lexicon-based pseudo-labeling method utilizing explainable AI(XAI) approach. Existing approach have a fundamental limitation in their robustness because poor classifier leads to inaccurate soft-labeling, and it lead to poor classifier repetitively. Meanwhile, we generate the lexicon consists of sentiment word based on the explainability score. Then we calculate the confidence of unlabeled data with lexicon and add them into labeled dataset for the robust pseudo-labeling approach. Our proposed method has three contributions. First, the proposed methodology automatically generates a lexicon based on XAI and performs independent pseudo-labeling, thereby guaranteeing higher performance and robustness compared to the existing one. Second, since lexicon-based pseudo-labeling is performed without re-learning in most of models, time efficiency is considerably increased, and third, the generated high-quality lexicon can be available for sentiment analysis of data from similar domains. The effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method were verified through quantitative comparison with the existing pseudo-labeling method and qualitative review of the generated lexicon. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The Evaluation of Teaching Effect is an effective method to ensure the quality of classroom teaching, which is conducive to the control and improvement of teaching quality. There are various methods of teaching evaluation. Nowadays, with the continuous development of artificial intelligence technology and big data technology, machine learning algorithm has been applied to evaluate teaching effect, which improves the efficiency and level of evaluation. However, the working principle of machine learning algorithm is still unexplained. Therefore, this paper proposes a method of the Evaluation of teaching effect based on machine learning interpretability, which studies the overall change of teaching effect when an evaluation index changes, and considers the correlation of each evaluation index, so as to study the importance of each evaluation index and promote the improvement of the final teaching effect. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Lattice regression-based models are highly-constrainable and interpretable machine learning models used in applications such as query classification and path length prediction for maps. To improve their performance and better serve these models to millions of consumers, we accelerate them using field programmable gate arrays. We adopt a library-based approach using a high level hardware description language (HLHDL) to support the broad family of lattice models. HLHDLs improve productivity by providing both control abstraction such as looping, reductions, and memory hierarchies, as well as automatically handling low-level tasks such as retiming. However, these abstractions can lead to performance bottlenecks if not carefully used. We characterize these bottlenecks and implement a lattice regression library using a streaming tensor abstraction which avoids them. On a pair of models trained for network anomaly detection, we achieve a 166,-,256 × speedup over CPUs even with large batch sizes. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - It has been shown in previous papers that traditional approaches to feature selection can lead to learning a two-tier decision tree, which significantly loses in accuracy to a enumerate of all non-empty subsets of features containing no more than three features. In this paper, on a real, public dataset, we calculated how often such an accuracy loss can occur. It is shown that there is a statistically significant correlation between the coefficient of determination of a two-tier decision tree, constructed without any feature selection, and the magnitude of such a loss in accuracy. The characteristic values for the loss of accuracy in the construction of a two-tier tree without any feature selection, compared to a full enumeration of all nonempty subsets of features containing no more than three features, for a real dataset in some domain are calculated. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Predictive process analytics uses advanced machine learning techniques to accurately predict future states of running business processes. Given the complexity of these predictive models, explainable AI techniques are also required to enable informed decision-making. However, few studies evaluate the quality of explanations provided by existing methods to explain business process predictions. In this paper, we attempt to evaluate the consistency of explanations produced for process predictions by two popular explainable methods. We propose that methods and metrics to assess feature selection algorithms can be used to evaluate explanation stability. We use these metrics to assess explanations produced by LIME and SHAP. Our findings indicate that explanation stability may depend on dataset characteristics, feature construction methods and predictive model characteristics. In addition, we also find that, though stable explanations are needed for informed decision-making, unexpected behaviour in explanation stability can act as a diagnostic tool to determine model quality. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - We present a position paper about our concept for an artificial intelligence (AI) and data streaming platform for the agricultural sector. The goal of our project is to support agroecology in terms of carbon farming and biodiversity protection by providing an AI and data streaming platform called Gaia-AgStream that accelerates the adoption of AI in agriculture and is directly usable by farmers as well as agricultural companies in general. The technical innovations we propose focus on smart sensor networks, unified uncertainty management, explainable AI, root cause analysis and hybrid AI approaches. Our AI and data streaming platform concept contributes to the European open data infrastructure project Gaia-X in terms of interoperability for data and AI models as well as data sovereignty and AI infrastructure. Our envisioned platform and the developed AI components for carbon farming and biodiversity will enable farmers to adopt sustainable and resilient production methods while establishing new and diverse revenue streams by monetizing carbon sequestration and AI ready data streams. The open and federated platform concept allows to bring together research, industry, agricultural start-ups and farmers in order to form sustainable innovation networks. We describe core concepts and architecture of our proposed approach in these contexts, outline practical use cases for our platform and finally outline challenges and future prospects. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In automated planning, the need for explanations arises when there is a mismatch between a proposed plan and the user's expectation. We frame Explainable AI Planning as an iterative plan exploration process, in which the user asks a succession of contrastive questions that lead to the generation and solution of hypothetical planning problems that are restrictions of the original problem. The object of the exploration is for the user to understand the constraints that govern the original plan and, ultimately, to arrive at a satisfactory plan. We present the results of a user study that demonstrates that when users ask questions about plans, those questions are usually contrastive, i.e. “why A rather than B?”. We use the data from this study to construct a taxonomy of user questions that often arise during plan exploration. Our approach to iterative plan exploration is a process of successive model restriction. Each contrastive user question imposes a set of constraints on the planning problem, leading to the construction of a new hypothetical planning problem as a restriction of the original. Solving this restricted problem results in a plan that can be compared with the original plan, admitting a contrastive explanation. We formally define model-based compilations in PDDL2.1 for each type of constraint derived from a contrastive user question in the taxonomy, and empirically evaluate the compilations in terms of computational complexity. The compilations were implemented as part of an explanation framework supporting iterative model restriction. We demonstrate its benefits in a second user study. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - As an emerging field in Machine Learning, Explainable AI (XAI) has been offering remarkable performance in interpreting the decisions made by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). To achieve visual explanations for CNNs, methods based on class activation mapping and randomized input sampling have gained great popularity. However, the attribution methods based on these techniques provide low-resolution and blurry explanation maps that limit their explanation ability. To circumvent this issue, visualization based on various layers is sought. In this work, we collect visualization maps from multiple layers of the model based on an attribution-based input sampling technique and aggregate them to reach a fine-grained and complete explanation. We also propose a layer selection strategy that applies to the whole family of CNN-based models, based on which our extraction framework is applied to visualize the last layers of each convolutional block of the model. Moreover, we perform an empirical analysis of the efficacy of derived lower-level information to enhance the represented attributions. Comprehensive experiments conducted on shallow and deep models trained on natural and industrial datasets, using both ground-truth and model-truth based evaluation metrics validate our proposed algorithm by meeting or outperforming the state-of-the-art methods in terms of explanation ability and visual quality, demonstrating that our method shows stability regardless of the size of objects or instances to be explained. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents a deep learning toolbox, DEEPPLACER, to assist designers during the layout design of analog integrated circuits. DEEPPLACER relies on a simple pairwise device interaction circuit description, i.e., the circuits’ topological constraints, to propose valid floorplan solutions for block-level structures, including topologies and deep technology nodes not used for its training, at push-button speed. Despite its automatic functionalities, the toolbox is focused on explainable artificial intelligence, involving the designer in the synthesis flow via filtering and editing options over the candidate floorplan solutions. This constant state of human-machine feedback environment turns the designer aware of the impact of each device’s position change and inherent tradeoffs while suggesting subsequent moves, ultimately increasing the designers’ productivity in this time-consuming and iterative task. Finally, DEEPPLACER is shown to instantly generate a floorplan with 61% better constraint fulfilment than a human designed solution. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

Explanations must not only suit developers of models, but also domain experts as well as end users. Thus, in order to satisfy different stakeholders, explanation methods need to be combined. While multi-modal explanations have been used to make model predictions more transparent, less research has focused on treating explanation as a process, where users can ask for information according to the level of understanding gained at a certain point in time. Consequently, an opportunity to explore explanations on different levels of abstraction should be provided besides multi-modal explanations. We present a process-based approach that combines multi-level and multi-modal explanations. The user can ask for textual explanations or visualizations through conversational interaction in a drill-down manner. We use Inductive Logic Programming, an interpretable machine learning approach, to learn a comprehensible model. Further, we present an algorithm that creates an explanatory tree for each example for which a classifier decision is to be explained. The explanatory tree can be navigated by the user to get answers of different levels of detail. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation for concepts induced from a semantic net about living beings. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper, we study how to explain to end-users the inference results of possibilistic rule-based systems. We formulate a necessary and sufficient condition for justifying by a relevant subset of rule premises the possibility degree of each output attribute value. We apply functions to reduce the selected premises, in order to form two kinds of explanations: the justification and the unexpectedness of the possibility degree of an output attribute value. The justification is composed of possibilistic expressions that are sufficient to justify the possibility degree of the output attribute value. The unexpectedness is a set of possible or certain possibilistic expressions, which are not involved in the determination of the considered inference result although there may appear to be a potential incompatibility between them and the considered inference result. We then define a representation of explanations of possibilistic inference decisions that relies on conceptual graphs and may be the input of natural language generation systems. Our extracted justification and unexpectedness are represented by nested conceptual graphs. All our constructions are illustrated with an example of a possibilistic rule-based system that controls the blood sugar level of a patient with type 1 diabetes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Many systems in the Edge Cloud, the Internet-of-Things or Cyber-Physical Systems are built for processing data, which is delivered from sensors and devices, transported, processed and consumed locally by actuators. This, given the regularly high volume of data, permits Artificial Intelligence (AI) strategies like Machine Learning (ML) to be used to generate the application and management functions needed. The quality of both source data and machine learning model is here unavoidably of high significance, yet has not been explored sufficiently as an explicit connection of the ML model quality that are created through ML procedures to the quality of data that the model functions consume in their construction. Here, we investigated the link between input data quality for ML function construction and the quality of these functions in data-driven software systems towards explainable model construction through an experimental approach with IoT Data using decision trees. We have 3 objectives in this research: 1. Search for indicators that influence data quality such as correctness and completeness and model construction factors on accuracy, precision and recall. 2. Estimate the impact of variations in model construction and data quality. 3. Identify change patterns that can be attributed to specific input changes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - 'One person's data or experience is another person's information' this has become the golden rule of the 21st century which has resulted in a massive reservoir of data and immense amounts of information generation. However, there is no control over the source of this information, accessibility of this information, or the quality of it, which has given rise to the presence of 'misinformation.' The research community has reacted by proposing frameworks and difficulties, which are helpful for (different subtasks of) recognizing misinformation. Most of these frameworks, however, fail to consider all the aspects that can contribute to making information 'credible'. Furthermore, a valid explanation for each considered feature's contribution to the model's decision stands missing in most work. With this in mind, the authors have attempted to produce a system that yields highly accurate decisions, thus effectively separating credible health blogs from their non-credible counterparts while providing valid user-friendly explanations. The study proposes an Explainable AI-assisted Multimodal Credibility Assessment System that examines the credibility of the platform where the blog is hosted, the credibility of the author of the blog and the credibility of the images that contribute to the blog. This novel framework contributes to the existing body of knowledge by assessing the credibility of misleading beauty blogs using multiple crucial modalities which would lead to an insightful information consumption by the users. The proposed pipeline was successfully implemented on multiple carefully curated datasets and correctly identified 274 non credible blogs out of 321 blogs with an accuracy of 97.5%, Precision of 0.973 F1score of 0.986. Further, the Explainable AI model, with the help of several visualizations displayed the feature contributions for each blog it's impact and magnitude in a concise comprehensible format. The framework can be further customized and applied to various domains where presence of misinformation is of high concern such as pharmaceutical drug information, pandemic management, financial advisories, online healthcare services and cyber frauds. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Explainable AI (XAI) has emerged in recent years as a set of techniques and methodologies to interpret and explain machine learning (ML) predictors. To date, many initiatives have been proposed. Nevertheless, current research efforts mainly focus on methods tailored to specific ML tasks and algorithms, such as image classification and sentiment analysis. However, explanation techniques are still embryotic, and they mainly target ML experts rather than heterogeneous end-users. Furthermore, existing solutions assume data to be centralised, homogeneous, and fully/continuously accessible—circumstances seldom found altogether in practice. Arguably, a system-wide perspective is currently missing. The project named “Personalized Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Decentralized Agents with Heterogeneous Knowledge ” (Expectation) aims at overcoming such limitations. This manuscript presents the overall objectives and approach of the Expectation project, focusing on the theoretical and practical advance of the state of the art of XAI towards the construction of personalised explanations in spite of decentralisation and heterogeneity of knowledge, agents, and explainees (both humans or virtual). To tackle the challenges posed by personalisation, decentralisation, and heterogeneity, the project fruitfully combines abstractions, methods, and approaches from the multi-agent systems, knowledge extraction/injection, negotiation, argumentation, and symbolic reasoning communities. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Experts rely on fraud detection and decision support systems to analyze fraud cases, a growing problem in digital retailing and banking. With the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for decision support, those experts face the black-box problem and lack trust in AI predictions for fraud. Such an issue has been tackled by employing Explainable AI (XAI) to provide experts with explained AI predictions through various explanation methods. However, fraud detection studies supported by XAI lack a user-centric perspective and discussion on how principles are deployed, both important requirements for experts to choose an appropriate explanation method. On the other hand, recent research in Information Systems (IS) and Human-Computer Interaction highlights the need for understanding user requirements to develop tailored design principles for decision support systems. In this research, we adopt a design science research methodology and IS theoretical lens to develop and evaluate design principles, which align fraud expert’s tasks with explanation methods for Explainable AI decision support. We evaluate the utility of these principles using an information quality framework to interview experts in banking fraud, plus a simulation. The results show that the principles are an useful tool for designing decision support systems for fraud detection with embedded user-centric Explainable AI. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Experimental data is often given as bit vectors, with vectors corresponding to observations, and coordinates to attributes, with a bit being true if the corresponding attribute was observed. Observations are usually grouped, e.g. into positive and negative samples. Among the essential tasks on such data, we have compression, the construction of classifiers for assigning new data, and information extraction. Our system, MCP, approaches these tasks by propositional logic. For each group of observations, MCP constructs a (usually small) conjunctive formula that is true for the observations of the group, and false for the others. Depending on the settings, the formula consists of Horn, dual-Horn, bijunctive or general clauses. To reduce its size, only relevant subsets of the attributes are considered. The formula is a (lossy) representation of the original data and generalizes the observations, as it is usually satisfied by more bit vectors than just the observations. It thus may serve as a classifier for new data. Moreover, (dual-)Horn clauses, when read as if-then rules, make dependencies between attributes explicit. They can be regarded as an explanation for classification decisions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems are increasingly utilizing image analysis and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, due to their high accuracy in several medical imaging fields, including the detection of Acute Lymphoblastic (or Lymphocytic) Leukemia (ALL) from peripheral blood samples. However, no method in the literature has specifically analyzed the focus quality of ALL images or proposed a technique for sharpening the samples in an adaptive way for the purpose of classification. To address this issue, in this paper we propose the first machine learning-based approach able to enhance blood sample images by an adaptive unsharpening method. The method uses image processing techniques and DL to normalize the radius of the cell, estimate the focus quality, adaptively improve the sharpness of the images, and then perform the classification. We evaluated the methodology on a public database of ALL images, considering several state-of-the-art CNNs to perform the classification, with results showing the validity of the proposed approach.

AB  - One of the main problems in the final stage of the production line of ornamental stone tiles is the process of quality control and product classification. Successful classification of natural stone tiles based on their aesthetical value can raise profitability. Machine learning is a technology with the capability to fulfil this task with a higher speed than conventional human expert based methods. This paper examines the performance of 15 convolutional neural networks in sorting dolomitic stone tiles as far as models' accuracy and interpretability are concerned. For the first time, these two performance indices of deep learning models are studied massively for the industrial application of machine vision based marbles sorting. The experiments revealed that the examined convolutional neural networks are able to predict the quality of the marble tiles in an industrial environment accurately in an interpretable way. Furthermore, the DenseNet201 model showed the best accuracy of 83.24%, a performance, which is supported by the consideration of the appropriate quality patterns from the marble tiles' surface. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - We present an explainable document search system (ExDocS), based on a re-ranking approach, that uses textual and visual explanations to explain document rankings to non-expert users. ExDocS attempts to answer questions such as “Why is document X ranked at Y for a given query?”, “How do we compare multiple documents to understand their relative rankings?”. The contribution of this work is on re-ranking methods based on various interpretable facets of evidence such as term statistics, contextual words, and citation-based popularity. Contribution from the user interface perspective consists of providing intuitive accessible explanations such as: “document X is at rank Y because of matches found like Z” along with visual elements designed to compare the evidence and thereby explain the rankings. The quality of our re-ranking approach is evaluated on benchmark data sets in an ad-hoc retrieval setting. Due to the absence of ground truth of explanations, we evaluate the aspects of interpretability and completeness of explanations in a user study. ExDocS is compared with a recent baseline - explainable search system (EXS), that uses a popular posthoc explanation method called LIME. In line with the “no free lunch” theorem, we find statistically significant results showing that ExDocS provides an explanation for rankings that are understandable and complete but the explanation comes at the cost of a drop in ranking quality. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In the last years many Machine Learning-based systems have achieved an extraordinary performance in a wide range of fields, especially Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. The construction of appropriate and meaningful explanations for the decisions of those systems, which are in may cases considered black boxes, is a hot research topic. Most of the state-of-the-art explanation systems in the field rely on generating synthetic instances to test them on the black box, analyse the results and build an interpretable model, which is then used to provide an understandable explanation. In this paper we focus on this generation process and propose Guided-LORE, a variant of the well-known LORE method. We conceptualise the problem of neighbourhood generation as a search and solve it using the Uniform Cost Search algorithm. The experimental results on four datasets reveal the effectiveness of our method when compared with the most relevant related works. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - We present a characterization about argumentation and proof in logic. Indeed, we show that proof for a claim α from a set of premises Φ can be deemed as a structured form of an argument for that claim. Due to the expressivity of classical propositional logic (PL), this work considers that the knowledge-base is represented in PL, in which the semantics and proof systems for individual arguments are studied and utilized. We show that natural deduction (ND) can be used as a basis of proof for an argument and also for modeling counterarguments in the form of canonical undercut. We reveal that ND does not merely enable for the construction of arguments but also paves the way naturally for a human-understandable form of argumentative reasoning. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach gives the feasibility of developing explainable artificial intelligence systems that can offer human-friendly explanations to the users. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The vehicle damage assessment includes classifying damage and estimating its repair cost and is an essential process in vehicle leasing and insurance industries. It contributes heavily to the actual cost the customer has to pay. The standard practices follow manual identification of damages and cost estimation of repairs, resulting in noisy images of the damaged parts, inconsistent categorization of damage types, and high variance in repair costs estimation between two appraisers. We employ explainable machine learning to highlight how the standard ML models and their training protocols fail when dealing with a dataset acquired without a standard procedure. In this paper, we present a multi-task image regression model for the leasing vehicle return assessment that leverages the car configuration to reduce the cost of repair assessment. Our solution achieves a 50% error reduction in the repair cost estimates. Furthermore, we present remedies base on hierarchical taxonomy and cost-sensitive loss to improve the damage classification accuracy. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Credit scoring has become an important risk management tool for money lending institutions. Over the years, statistical and classical machine learning models have been the most researched risk management tools in credit scoring literature, and recently the focus has turned to deep learning models. This transition is due to better performances that are shown by deep learning models in different domains. Despite deep learning models' superior performances, there is still a need for explaining how these models make their predictions. The non-transparency nature of deep learning models has created a bottleneck for their use in credit scoring. Explanations of decisions are important for lending institutions since it is a requirement for automated decisions that are generated by non-transparent models to be explained. The other issue in using deep learning models, specifically 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), in credit scoring is the need to have the data in image format. We propose an explainable deep learning model for credit scoring which can harness the performance benefits offered by deep learning and yet comply with the legislation requirements for the automated decision-making processes. The proposed method converts tabular datasets into images and thus allowing the application of 2D CNNs in credit scoring. Each pixel of the image corresponds to a feature bin of the tabular dataset. The predictions from the 2D CNNs were explained using state-of-the-art explanation methods. Furthermore, explanations were evaluated using a sanity check methodology and also performances of the explanation methods were compared quantitatively. The proposed explainable deep learning model outperforms the other credit scoring methods on publicly available credit scoring datasets. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The inevitable rise and development of artificial intelligence (AI) was not a sudden occurrence. The greater the effect that AI has on humans, the more pressing the need is for us to understand it. This paper addresses research on the use of AI to evaluate new design methods and tools that can be leveraged to advance AI research, education, policy, and practice to improve the human condition. AI has the potential to educate, train, and improve the performance of humans, making them better at their tasks and activities. The use of AI can enhance human welfare in numerous respects, such as through improving the productivity of food, health, water, education, and energy services. However, the misuse of AI due to algorithm bias and a lack of governance could inhibit human rights and result in employment, gender, and racial inequality. We envision that AI can evolve into human-centered AI (HAI), which refers to approaching AI from a human perspective by considering human conditions and contexts. Most current discussions on AI technology focus on how AI can enable human performance. However, we explore AI can also inhibit the human condition and advocate for an in-depth dialog between technology- and humanity-based researchers to improve understanding of HAI from various perspectives. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The empirical success of the Artificial Intelligence (AI), has enhanced importance of the transparency in black box Machine Learning (ML) models. This study pioneers in developing an explainable and interpretable Deep Neural Network (DNN) model for a Guideless Irregular Dew Point Cooler (GIDPC). The game theory based SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method is used to interpret contribution of the operating conditions on performance parameters. Furthermore, in a response to the endeavours in developing more efficient metaheuristic optimisation algorithms for the energy systems, two Evolutionary Optimisation (EO) algorithms including a novel bio-inspired algorithm i.e., Slime Mould Algorithm (SMA), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), are employed to simultaneously maximise the cooling efficiency and minimise the construction cost of the GIDPC. Additionally, performance of the optimised GIDPCs are compared in both statistical and deterministic way. The comparisons are carried out in diverse climates in 2020 and 2050 in which the hourly future weather data are projected using a high-emission scenario defined by Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC). The results revealed that the hourly COP of the optimised systems outperform the base design. Although power consumption of all systems increases from 2020 to 2050, owing to more operating hours as a result of global warming, but power savings of up to 72%, 69.49%, 63.24%, and 69.21% in hot summer continental, Arid, tropical rainforest and Mediterranean hot summer climates respectively, can be achieved when the systems run optimally. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The paper proposes an explainable Artificial Intelligence model that can be used in credit risk management and, in particular, in measuring the risks that arise when credit is borrowed employing peer to peer lending platforms. The model applies correlation networks to Shapley values so that Artificial Intelligence predictions are grouped according to the similarity in the underlying explanations. The empirical analysis of 15,000 small and medium companies asking for credit reveals that both risky and not risky borrowers can be grouped according to a set of similar financial characteristics, which can be employed to explain their credit score and, therefore, to predict their future behaviour. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The approximation and emulation of first principles based deterministic models are important problems in many disciplines, like physical and natural sciences, as well as in engineering (industrial design, creation of digital twins and other tasks). Typically they involve complex systems, described by partial differential or integral equations which must be solved for a variety of space and time boundary conditions. Finding these solutions is usually costly in terms of both computational resources and time. Surrogate models are an effective way of building approximations that may replace the use of the compled/costly original models, expediting and speeding operations. Computational intelligence techniques have proven suitable for surrogating purposes and this paper explores the characterization of a relatively simple deterministic system described by a partial differential equation, using white as well as black box approaches for direct supervised mappings (inverse mappings are explored elsewhere). In addition, unsupervised methods are used for gaining insight into the properties of the input and output state spaces. White-box ML techniques exposed the nature of the inter-dependencies and the importance of the predictor variables. Individually, support vector regression outperformed all other models for the fixed-location, fixed time and also for the fixedlocation, time dependent scenario. However, performance-wise, the ensemble composed of white-box techniques outperformed the one integrated by black-box methods from the point of view of error and correlation measures. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Finding a reliable and cost-effective approach to monitor the activities of the New Austrian Tunneling Method (NATM) tunnel construction automatically is a challenging yet important task. This study presents an interpretable artificial intelligence (AI) framework that automatically identifies NATM construction works using low-cost site surveillance images. The framework adopts the Bayesian statistics to combine the prior NATM construction knowledge with the visual evidence extracted by deep learning (DL) based computer vision models. The analysis results of Site CCTV surveillance videos of four NATM tunneling projects are presented to demonstrate its ability (i) to label NATM work cycles from the work timeline, (ii) to identify NATM work categories inside each work cycle, and (iii) to estimate the degree of plan-work deviation at the construction cycle level. The proposed framework yields promising results on a real NATM tunneling project. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Clinical decision support systems have the potential to improve work flows of experts in practice (e.g. Therapist's evidence-based rehabilitation assessment). However, the adoption of these systems is challenging, and the gains of these systems have not fully demonstrated yet. In this paper, we identified the needs of therapists to assess patient's functional abilities (e.g. alternative perspectives with quantitative information on patient's exercise motions). As a result, we co-designed and developed an intelligent decision support system that automatically identifies salient features of assessment using reinforcement learning to assess the quality of motion and generate patient-specific analysis. We evaluated this system with seven therapists using the dataset from 15 patients performing three exercises. The results show that therapists have higher usage intent on our system than a traditional system without patient-specific analysis ($p < 0.05$). While presenting richer information ($p < 0.10$), our system significantly reduces therapists' effort on assessment ($p < 0.10$) and improves their agreement on assessment from 0.66 to 0.71 F1-scores ($p < 0.01$). This work discusses the importance of human centered design and development of a machine learning-based decision support system that presents contextually relevant information and salient explanations on its prediction for better adoption in practice. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Deep Learning models such as Convolutional Neural Nets (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Nets (RNNs) are routinely used due to their utility and benefits in various practical applications such as e.g., natural language processing and image recognition. However, despite such adoption, these techniques typically present opaqueness of their internal workings to users. The current black box approach to deep learning makes models difficult to understand and fine-tune, and the related lack of information directly influences productivity and hinders innovations in reliable and consistent model development. In this paper, we present a novel web-based, graphical approach to visualizing CNNs and RNNs to address the above adoption challenges. Our approach features an interactive graphical user interface, where the user can view the overarching network architecture and data flow, the weights and corresponding input processing at each layer, and some interpretable aspects of the model as a whole. We show the effectiveness of our visualization techniques on the MNIST dataset corresponding to an image recognition application. Our work contributes to the effective graphical visualization approaches for complex neural networks and thus makes it easier to manage, manipulate, and increase the performance of these networks. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - We examine “conversational receptiveness” – the use of language to communicate one's willingness to thoughtfully engage with opposing views. We develop an interpretable machine-learning algorithm to identify the linguistic profile of receptiveness (Studies 1A-B). We then show that in contentious policy discussions, government executives who were rated as more receptive - according to our algorithm and their partners, but not their own self-evaluations - were considered better teammates, advisors, and workplace representatives (Study 2). Furthermore, using field data from a setting where conflict management is endemic to productivity, we show that conversational receptiveness at the beginning of a conversation forestalls conflict escalation at the end. Specifically, Wikipedia editors who write more receptive posts are less prone to receiving personal attacks from disagreeing editors (Study 3). We develop a “receptiveness recipe” intervention based on our algorithm. We find that writers who follow the recipe are seen as more desirable partners for future collaboration and their messages are seen as more persuasive (Study 4). Overall, we find that conversational receptiveness is reliably measurable, has meaningful relational consequences, and can be substantially improved using our intervention (183 words). © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The negative impact of absenteeism on organizations' productivity and profitability is well established. To decrease absenteeism, it is imperative to understand its underlying causes and to identify susceptible employee subgroups. Most research studies apply hypotheses testing and regression models to identify features that are correlated with absenteeism-typically, these models are limited to finding simple correlations. We illustrate the use of interpretable classification algorithms for uncovering subgroups of employees with common characteristics and a similar level of absenteeism. This process may assist human resource managers in understanding the underlying reasons for absenteeism, which, in turn, could stimulate measures to decrease it. Our proposed methodology makes use of an objective-based information gain measure in conjunction with an ordinal CART model. Our results indicate that the ordinal CART model outperforms conventional classifiers and, more importantly, identifies patterns in the data that have not been revealed by other models. We demonstrate the importance of interpretability for human resource management through three examples. The main contributions of this research are (1) the development of an information-based ordinal classifier for a published absenteeism dataset and (2) the illustration of an interpretable approach that could be of considerable value in supporting human resource management decision-making. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) reveals new opportunities in Industry 4.0 environments. However, the lack of appropriate data and the requirements for trustworthiness pose significant challenges in the applicability and the effectiveness of AI systems in manufacturing environments. On the other hand, Industry 4.0 enables new types of interactions between humans and AI, but also between digital and physical worlds in the context of Cyber Physical Systems (CPS). In this paper, a Human Cyber Physical System (HCPS) framework for Operator 4.0 – Artificial Intelligence Symbiosis is proposed and its main architectural building blocks are described. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is enjoying unprecedented success and is dramatically transforming the landscape of the financial services industry. However, there is a strong need to develop an accountability and explainability framework for AI in financial services, based on a risk-based assessment of appropriate explainability levels and techniques by use case and domain.This paper proposes a risk management framework for the implementation of AI in banking with consideration of explainability and outlines the implementation requirements to enable AI to achieve positive outcomes for financial institutions and the customers, markets and societies they serve. The work presents the evaluation of three algorithmic approaches (Neural Networks, Logistic Regression and Type 2 Fuzzy Logic with evolutionary optimisation) for nine banking use cases. We review the emerging regulatory and industry guidance on ethical and safe adoption of AI from key markets worldwide and compare leading AI explainability techniques.We will show that the Type-2 Fuzzy Logic models deliver very good performance which is comparable to or lagging marginally behind the Neural Network models in terms of accuracy, but outperform all models for explainability, thus they are recommended as a suitable machine learning approach for use cases in financial services from an explainability perspective. This research is important for several reasons: (i) there is limited knowledge and understanding of the potential for Type-2 Fuzzy Logic as a highly adaptable, high performing, explainable AI technique; (ii) there is limited cross discipline understanding between financial services and AI expertise and this work aims to bridge that gap; (iii) regulatory thinking is evolving with limited guidance worldwide and this work aims to support that thinking; (iv) it is important that banks retain customer trust and maintain market stability as adoption of AI increases. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Decision support systems (DSS) help users to make more informed and more effective decisions. In recent years, many intelligent DSS (IDSS) in business contexts involve machine learning (ML) methods, which make them inherently hard to explain and comprehend logically. Incomprehensible predictions, however, might violate the users' expectations. While explanations can help with this, prior research also shows that providing explanations in all situations may negatively impact trust and adherence, especially for users experienced in the decision task at hand. We used a human-centered design approach with domain experts to design a DSS for funds management in the construction industry and identified a strong need for control, personal involvement, and adequate data. To create an adequate level of trust and reliance, we contrasted the system's predictions with the values derived from an analytic hierarchical process (AHP), which makes the relative importance of our users' decision-making criteria explicit. We developed a prototype and evaluated its acceptance with 7 construction industry experts. By identifying situations in which the ML prediction and the domain expert potentially disagree, the DSS can identify a persuasion gap and use explanations more selectively. Our evaluation showed promising results and we plan to generalize our approach to a wider range of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) problems, e.g., to provide explanations with arguments tailored to the user. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The research on the interpretability of deep learning is closely related to various disciplines such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, logic and cognitive psychology. It has important theoretical research significance and practical application value in too many fields, such as information push, medical research, finance, and information security. In the past few years, there were a lot of well studied work in this field, but we are still facing various issues. In this paper, we clearly review the history of deep learning interpretability research and related work. Firstly, we introduce the history of interpretable deep learning from following three aspects: origin of interpretable deep learning, research exploration stage and model construction stage. Then, the research situation is presented from three aspects, namely visual analysis, robust perturbation analysis and sensitivity analysis. The research on the construction of interpretable deep learning model is introduced following four aspects: model agent, logical reasoning, network node association analysis and traditional machine learning model. Moreover, the limitations of current research are analyzed and discussed in this paper. At last, we list the typical applications of the interpretable deep learning and forecast the possible future research directions of this field along with reasonable and suitable suggestions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this work, we provide some insights and develop some ideas, with few technical details, about the role of explanations in Data Quality in the context of data-based machine learning models (ML). In this direction, there are, as expected, roles for causality, and explainable artificial intelligence. The latter area not only sheds light on the models, but also on the data that support model construction. There is also room for defining, identifying, and explaining errors in data, in particular, in ML, and also for suggesting repair actions. More generally, explanations can be used as a basis for defining dirty data in the context of ML, and measuring or quantifying them. We think dirtiness as relative to the ML task at hand, e.g., classification. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The paper proposes an explainable AI model that can be used in fintech risk management and, in particular, in measuring the risks that arise when credit is borrowed employing peer to peer lending platforms. The model employs Shapley values, so that AI predictions are interpreted according to the underlying explanatory variables. The empirical analysis of 15,000 small and medium companies asking for peer to peer lending credit reveals that both risky and not risky borrowers can be grouped according to a set of similar financial characteristics, which can be employed to explain and understand their credit score and, therefore, to predict their future behavior. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Currently, the diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is dependent upon a subjective, time-consuming evaluation of behavioral tests by an expert clinician. Non-invasive functional MRI (fMRI) characterizes brain connectivity and may be used to inform diagnoses and democratize medicine. However, successful construction of predictive models, such as deep learning models, from fMRI requires addressing key choices about the model's architecture, including the number of layers and number of neurons per layer. Meanwhile, deriving functional connectivity (FC) features from fMRI requires choosing an atlas with an appropriate level of granularity. Once an accurate diagnostic model has been built, it is vital to determine which features are predictive of ASD and if similar features are learned across atlas granularity levels. Identifying new important features extends our understanding of the biological underpinnings of ASD, while identifying features that corroborate past findings and extend across atlas levels instills model confidence. To identify aptly suited architectural configurations, probability distributions of the configurations of high versus low performing models are compared. To determine the effect of atlas granularity, connectivity features are derived from atlases with 3 levels of granularity and important features are ranked with permutation feature importance. Results show the highest performing models use between 2-4 hidden layers and 16-64 neurons per layer, granularity dependent. Connectivity features identified as important across all 3 atlas granularity levels include FC to the supplementary motor gyrus and language association cortex, regions whose abnormal development are associated with deficits in social and sensory processing common in ASD. Importantly, the cerebellum, often not included in functional analyses, is also identified as a region whose abnormal connectivity is highly predictive of ASD. Results of this study identify important regions to include in future studies of ASD, help assist in the selection of network architectures, and help identify appropriate levels of granularity to facilitate the development of accurate diagnostic models of ASD. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Deep-Fakes have sparked concerns throughout the world because of their potentially explosive consequences. A dystopian future where all forms of digital media are potentially compromised and public trust in Government is scarce doesn't seem far off. If not dealt with the requisite seriousness, the situation could easily spiral out of control. Current methods of Deep-Fake detection aim to accurately solve the issue at hand but may fail to convince a lay-person of its reliability and thus, lack the trust of the general public. Since the fundamental issue revolves around earning the trust of human agents, the construction of interpretable and also easily explainable models is imperative. We propose a framework to detect these Deep-Fake videos using a Deep Learning Approach: we have trained a Convolutional Neural Network architecture on a database of extracted faces from FaceForensics' DeepFakeDetection Dataset. Furthermore, we have tested the model on various Explainable AI techniques such as LRP and LIME to provide crisp visualizations of the salient regions of the image focused on by the model. The prospective and elusive goal is to localize the facial manipulations caused by Faceswaps. We hope to use this approach to build trust between AI and Human agents and to demonstrate the applicability of XAI in various real-life scenarios. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Feature construction can substantially improve the accuracy of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Genetic Programming (GP) has been proven to be effective at this task by evolving non-linear combinations of input features. GP additionally has the potential to improve ML explainability since explicit expressions are evolved. Yet, in most GP works the complexity of evolved features is not explicitly bound or minimized though this is arguably key for explainability. In this article, we assess to what extent GP still performs favorably at feature construction when constructing features that are (1) Of small-enough number, to enable visualization of the behavior of the ML model; (2) Of small-enough size, to enable interpretability of the features themselves; (3) Of sufficient informative power, to retain or even improve the performance of the ML algorithm. We consider a simple feature construction scheme using three different GP algorithms, as well as random search, to evolve features for five ML algorithms, including support vector machines and random forest. Our results on 21 datasets pertaining to classification and regression problems show that constructing only two compact features can be sufficient to rival the use of the entire original feature set. We further find that a modern GP algorithm, GP-GOMEA, performs best overall. These results, combined with examples that we provide of readable constructed features and of 2D visualizations of ML behavior, lead us to positively conclude that GP-based feature construction still works well when explicitly searching for compact features, making it extremely helpful to explain ML models. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The explainable AI literature contains multiple notions of what an explanation is and what desiderata explanations should satisfy. One implicit source of disagreement is how far the explanations should reflect real patterns in the data or the world. This disagreement underlies debates about other desiderata, such as how robust explanations are to slight perturbations in the input data. I argue that robustness is desirable to the extent that we're concerned about finding real patterns in the world. The import of real patterns differs according to the problem context. In some contexts, non-robust explanations can constitute a moral hazard. By being clear about the extent to which we care about capturing real patterns, we can also determine whether the Rashomon Effect is a boon or a bane. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - An Augmented AI approach has been developed to optimize completion design parameters and access the full potential of unconventional assets by leveraging big data sculpting, domain-induced feature engineering, and robust and explainable machine learning models with quantified uncertainty. This method unlocks the full potential of a well using completion design parameters optimization that considers all the factors that impact well performance, geological characteristics, well trajectory, spacing, etc. By leveraging basin-level knowledge captured by big data sculpting with the use of uncertainty quantification, Augmented AI can provide quick and science-based answers for completion optimization, and also assess the full potential of an asset in unconventional reservoirs. By leveraging computer vision and natural language processing techniques, unstructured data from various sources were deciphered, combined and organized into a structured database. Imputation techniques were used to fill the gaps of missing data. With the Augmented AI approach, the median accuracies of IP and EUR predictions for new drills is around 90%, which often outperforms industry-standard type curving methods. With the explainable machine learning (ML) model, the direct impact of completion design parameters on well performance is deconvoluted among other parameters, such as engineering and geological attributes. The prediction also comes with an 80% confidence interval to quantify the prediction uncertainties, which allows for better risk management and confident business decision making. With the ML model and given economic inputs and metrics, many sensitivity analyses are performed to evaluate optimized completion design parameters. The proposed Augmented AI approach has been deployed to Eagle Ford wells. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The rapid technology development related to machine learning and data-driven models for autonomous and unmanned vessels continues. Also manned vessels can make use of this technology, for example to enhance situational awareness of an on board navigator. Potentially, this can contribute to increase safety and to optimize operations by transferring tasks and functions to where they are most effectively handled, ashore and on board. However, the introduction of decision support systems and functionality to enhance situational awareness can have detrimental consequences, due to for example misunderstandings, wrong use of the functionality, malfunctioning user-interface, as well as bad or wrong decision proposals. This can be the case, even when manning levels are kept unchanged. To ensure safety, we argue that the system must be rigorously tested, and the system's limitations, uncertainties and capabilities must be correctly conveyed to its users. Based on current regulations, including the International Maritime Organization (IMO) resolution Principles of minimum safe manning, we investigate how minimum safe manning of a vessel should be established considering relevant factors, including the ship's level of automation and shore support. We also discuss challenges related to lack of specification, which is an inherent challenge to decision support systems based on object detection and image classification since these tasks rely on perception of the environment, which can only partially be specified using rules. Furthermore, challenges related to lack of explainability are discussed, and potential benefits of using methods for black-box explanation during operation and during testing are investigated. We emphasize the importance of testing and verification of the dataset used to train the models, ensuring that it sufficiently covers relevant scenarios. We also discuss challenges related to human factors, and emphasize the importance of safety management systems used to identify risks, responsibilities, resources and competencies ensuring compliance with rules and regulations. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The emerging research field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) addresses the problem that users do not trust or blindly follow AI systems that act as black boxes. XAI research to date is often criticized for not putting the user at the center of attention. Against this background, we design a process to systematically guide the instantiation, calibration, and quality control of XAI systems such that they foster human agency and enable appropriate trust in AI systems. The process can be applied independent of the XAI method, application domain, and target user group. It incorporates the principles of user-centric design, insights into explanations from the social sciences, and established XAI evaluation scenarios. Following the Design Science methodology, we demonstrate the practical applicability of our artifact and evaluate its efficacy in a realistic setting. Our work contributes to the design of user-centric XAI systems and the quest for human agency in AI. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Decision tree optimization is notoriously difficult from a computational perspective but essential for the field of interpretable machine learning. Despite efforts over the past 40 years, only recently have optimization breakthroughs been made that have allowed practical algorithms to find optimal decision trees. These new techniques have the potential to trigger a paradigm shift where it is possible to construct sparse decision trees to efficiently optimize a variety of objective functions without relying on greedy splitting and pruning heuristics that often lead to suboptimal solutions. The contribution in this work is to provide a general framework for decision tree optimization that addresses the two significant open problems in the area: treatment of imbalanced data and fully optimizing over continuous variables. We present techniques that produce optimal decision trees over a variety of objectives including F-score, AUC, and partial area under the ROC convex hull. We also introduce a scalable algorithm that produces provably optimal results in the presence of continuous variables and speeds up decision tree construction by several orders of magnitude relative to the stateof- the art. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Explaining deep models is desirable especially for improving the user trust and experience. Much progress has been done recently towards visually and semantically explaining deep models. However, establishing the most effective explanation is often human-dependent, which suffers from the bias of the annotators. To address this issue, we propose a multitask learning network (MTL-Net) that generates saliency-based visual explanation as well as attribute-based semantic explanation. Via an integrated evaluation mechanism, our model quantitatively evaluates the quality of the generated explanations. First, we introduce attributes to the image classification process and rank the attribute contribution with gradient weighted mapping, then generate semantic explanations with those attributes. Second, we propose a fusion classification mechanism (FCM) to evaluate three recent saliency-based visual explanation methods by their influence on the classification. Third, we conduct user studies, quantitative and qualitative evaluations. According to our results on three benchmark datasets with varying size and granularity, our attribute-based semantic explanations are not only helpful to the user but they also improve the classification accuracy of the model, and our ranking framework detects the best performing visual explanation method in agreement with the users. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning is a recently proposed online planning algorithm which makes use of Monte Carlo Tree Search to solve Partially Observable Monte Carlo Decision Processes. This solver is very successful because of its capability to scale to large uncertain environments, a very important property for current real-world planning problems. In this work we propose three main contributions related to POMCP usage and interpretability. First, we introduce a new planning problem related to mobile robot collision avoidance in paths with uncertain segment difficulties, and we show how POMCP performance in this context can take advantage of prior knowledge about segment difficulty relationships. This problem has direct real-world applications, such as, safety management in industrial environments where human-robot interaction is a crucial issue. Then, we present an experimental analysis about the relationships between prior knowledge provided to the algorithm and performance improvement, showing that in our case study prior knowledge affects two main properties, namely, the distance between the belief and the real state, and the mutual information between segment difficulty and action taken in the segment. This analysis aims to improve POMCP explainability, following the line of recently proposed eXplainable AI and, in particular, eXplainable planning. Finally, we analyze results on a synthetic case study and show how the proposed measures can improve the understanding about internal planning mechanisms. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Clinical reasoning, involving abstraction, abduction, deduction, and induction, is the primary tool that physicians use when making clinical decisions. To support them, we focus on the creation of an AI system that is able to emulate clinical reasoning. We leverage Semantic Web technologies to perform a set of AI tasks involving the various forms of inference associated with clinical reasoning strategies. In particular, for the scope of this work, we focus on clinical problems that require differential diagnosis techniques. For a given clinical scenario, overlapping reasoning types and strategies may be employed by a physician in conjunction, signifying the need for our AI system to perform hybrid reasoning. Therefore, we consider the construction of a hybrid reasoner that is compatible with description logics. For medical scenarios where description logics may not have some needed expressivity, we consider possible extensions that will allow for the representation of such a scenario. The reasoning system, clinical rule representation, and the resulting recommendations will be evaluated based on domain expert consultation in order to determine whether the recommendation aligns with what the expert would recommend. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In the healthcare domain, Artificial Intelligence (AI) based systems are being increasingly adopted with applications ranging from surgical robots to automated medical diagnostics. While a Machine Learning (ML) engineer might be interested in the parameters related to the performance and accuracy of these AI-based systems, it is postulated that a medical practitioner would be more concerned with the applicability, and utility of these systems in the medical setting. However, medical practitioners are unlikely to have the prerequisite skills to enable reasonable interpretation of an AI-based system. This is a concern for two reasons. Firstly, it inhibits the adoption of systems capable of automating routine analysis work and prevents the associated productivity gains. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, it reduces the scope of expertise available to assist in the validation, iteration, and improvement of AI-based systems in providing healthcare solutions. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a domain focused on techniques and approaches that facilitate the understanding and interpretation of the operation of ML models. Research interest in the domain of XAI is becoming more widespread due to the increasing adoption of AI-based solutions and the associated regulatory requirements [1]. Providing an understanding of ML models is typically approached from a Computer Science (CS) perspective [2] with a limited research emphasis being placed on supporting alternate domains [3]. In this paper, a simple, yet powerful solution for increasing the explainability of AI-based solutions to individuals from non-CS domains (such as medical practitioners), is presented. The proposed solution enables the explainability of ML models and the underlying workflows to be readily integrated into a standard ML workflow. Central to this solution are feature importance techniques that measure the impact of individual features on the outcomes of AI-based systems. It is envisaged that feature importance can enable a high-level understanding of a ML model and the workflow used to train the model. This could aid medical practitioners in comprehending AI-based systems and enhance their understanding of ML models' applicability and utility. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - We propose an unprecedented approach to post-hoc interpretable machine learning. Facing a complex phenomenon, rather than fully capturing its mechanisms through a universal learner, albeit structured in modular building blocks, we train a robust neural network, no matter its complexity, to use as an oracle. Then we approximate its behavior via a linear combination of simple, explicit functions of its input. Simplicity is achieved by (i) marginal functions mapping individual inputs to the network output, (ii) the same consisting of univariate polynomials with a low degree,(iii) a small number of polynomials being involved in the linear combination, whose input is properly granulated. With this contrivance, we handle various real-world learning scenarios arising from expertise and experimental frameworks’ composition. They range from cooperative training instances to transfer learning. Concise theoretical considerations and comparative numerical experiments further detail and support the proposed approach . © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: This concise review aims to explore the potential for the clinical implemen-tation of artificial intelligence (AI) strategies for detecting glaucoma and monitoring glaucoma progression. Methods: Nonsystematic literature review using the search combinations “Artifi-cial Intelligence,” “Deep Learning,” “Machine Learning,” “Neural Networks,” “Bayesian Networks,” “Glaucoma Diagnosis,” and “Glaucoma Progression.” Information on sensitivity and specificity regarding glaucoma diagnosis and progression analysis as well as methodological details were extracted. Results: Numerous AI strategies provide promising levels of specificity and sensitivity for structural (e.g. optical coherence tomography [OCT] imaging, fundus photogra-phy) and functional (visual field [VF] testing) test modalities used for the detection of glaucoma. Area under receiver operating curve (AROC) values of > 0.90 were achieved with every modality. Combining structural and functional inputs has been shown to even more improve the diagnostic ability. Regarding glaucoma progression, AI strategies can detect progression earlier than conventional methods or potentially from one single VF test. Conclusions: AI algorithms applied to fundus photographs for screening purposes may provide good results using a simple and widely accessible test. However, for patients who are likely to have glaucoma more sophisticated methods should be used including data from OCT and perimetry. Outputs may serve as an adjunct to assist clinical decision making, whereas also enhancing the efficiency, productivity, and quality of the delivery of glaucoma care. Patients with diagnosed glaucoma may benefit from future algorithms to evaluate their risk of progression. Challenges are yet to be overcome, including the external validity of AI strategies, a move from a “black box” toward “explainable AI,” and likely regulatory hurdles. However, it is clear that AI can enhance the role of specialist clinicians and will inevitably shape the future of the delivery of glaucoma care to the next generation. Translational Relevance: The promising levels of diagnostic accuracy reported by AI strategies across the modalities used in clinical practice for glaucoma detection can pave the way for the development of reliable models appropriate for their translation into clinical practice. Future incorporation of AI into healthcare models may help address the current limitations of access and timely management of patients with glaucoma across the world. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Learning from complex real-life networks is a lively research area, with recent advances in learning information-rich, low-dimensional network node representations. However, state-of-the-art methods are not necessarily interpretable and are therefore not fully applicable to sensitive settings in biomedical or user profiling tasks, where explicit bias detection is highly relevant. The proposed SNoRe (Symbolic Node Representations) algorithm is capable of learning symbolic, human-understandable representations of individual network nodes, based on the similarity of neighborhood hashes which serve as features. SNoRe's interpretable features are suitable for direct explanation of individual predictions, which we demonstrate by coupling it with the widely used instance explanation tool SHAP to obtain nomograms representing the relevance of individual features for a given classification. To our knowledge, this is one of the first such attempts in a structural node embedding setting. In the experimental evaluation on eleven real-life datasets, SNoRe proved to be competitive to strong baselines, such as variational graph autoencoders, node2vec and LINE. The vectorized implementation of SNoRe scales to large networks, making it suitable for contemporary network learning and analysis tasks. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In many machine learning applications, interpretable models are necessary for the sake of trust or for further understanding the patterns in the data. In particular, scientists often want models that elucidate knowledge and therefore may lead to new discoveries. Currently, Generalized Additive Models (GAM) are gaining interest in other application domains because of their ability to fit the data well while at the same time being intelligible. Moreover, prior domain-specific knowledge is often valuable to guide the learning. In this work, extensions and generalizations of GAM are proposed to incorporate prior knowledge during the learning phase. Specifically, the fitting method for GAM is modified so that it can fit the data with bitonic functions. In physics for instance, the most discriminative variables often present specific distributions with respect to the target variable, especially peaking (i.e. bitonic) distributions. An algorithm is also described to build automatically bitonic high-level features to be used in the GAM terms. Experiments on three physics datasets are used to validate these ideas in conjunction with physics scientists. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - We present a framework for an explainable and statistically validated ensemble clustering model applied to Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). The objective of our analysis is to identify patient injury severity subgroups and key phenotypes that delineate these subgroups using varied clinical and computed tomography data. Explainable and statistically-validated models are essential because a data-driven identification of subgroups is an inherently multidisciplinary undertaking. In our case, this procedure yielded six distinct patient subgroups with respect to mechanism of injury, severity of presentation, anatomy, psychometric, and functional outcome. This framework for ensemble cluster analysis fully integrates statistical methods at several stages of analysis to enhance the quality and the explainability of results. This methodology is applicable to other clinical data sets that exhibit significant heterogeneity as well as other diverse data science applications in biomedicine and elsewhere. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - During the analysis of neurobiological signals acquired during neurosurgical procedures such as Deep Brain Stimulation, one focuses mainly on the signal’s background and spiking activity. Spikes, the electrical impulses generated by neuron cells, are events lasting about 1.5 ms with voltage typically well below 200 V. As the shape of spike derives from the physical construction of the neuron’s cell membrane and its distance from the recording point, one can infer that spikes of different shapes were generated by different neuron cells. This information can be beneficial during the analysis of the acquired signals, and the procedure of grouping spikes according to their shapes, is called spike sorting. Typically in this procedure, there are defined various attributes characterizing spike shape, and subsequently, the standard clustering method is used to produce groups of spikes of different shapes. This may cause some difficulties that arise both from the definition of good discriminating attributes as well as from the fact that one does not know beforehand how many clusters of shapes to expect. The approach presented in this paper is different, using the fully unsupervised and explainable AI, it generates groups of spike shapes in a fully automatic way. No attributes have to be defined nor the expected number of shape clusters provided. Spike waveforms are fed into the autoencoder that has defined additional constraints on its latent layers. After training, data obtained from those layers can be used for the purpose of spike shape clustering. Beside shape class, one also receives information on how much given spike shape differs from the mean shape of its class. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The development of theory, frameworks and tools for Explainable AI (XAI) is a very active area of research these days, and articulating any kind of coherence on a vision and challenges is itself a challenge. At least two sometimes complementary and colliding threads have emerged. The first focuses on the development of pragmatic tools for increasing the transparency of automatically learned prediction models, as for instance by deep or reinforcement learning. The second is aimed at anticipating the negative impact of opaque models with the desire to regulate or control impactful consequences of incorrect predictions, especially in sensitive areas like medicine and law. The formulation of methods to augment the construction of predictive models with domain knowledge can provide support for producing human understandable explanations for predictions. This runs in parallel with AI regulatory concerns, like the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, which sets standards for the production of explanations from automated or semi-automated decision making. Despite the fact that all this research activity is the growing acknowledgement that the topic of explainability is essential, it is important to recall that it is also among the oldest fields of computer science. In fact, early AI was re-traceable, interpretable, thus understandable by and explainable to humans. The goal of this research is to articulate the big picture ideas and their role in advancing the development of XAI systems, to acknowledge their historical roots, and to emphasise the biggest challenges to moving forward. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being integrated into different areas of our lives. AI has the potential to increase productivity and relieve workload on staff in high-pressure jobs such as healthcare. However, most AI healthcare tools have failed. For AI to be effective, it is vital that users can understand how the system is processing data. Explainable AI (XAI) moves away from the traditional ‘black box’ approach, aiming to make the processes behind the system more transparent. This experimental study uses real healthcare data – and combines a computer science and psychological approach – to investigate user trust and understanding of three popular XAI algorithms (Decision Trees, Logistic Regression and Neural Networks). The results question the contribution of understanding towards user trust; Suggesting that understanding and explainability are not the only factors contributing to trust in AI. Users also show biases in trust and understanding – with a particular bias towards malignant results. This raises important issues around how humans can be encouraged to make more accurate judgements when using XAI systems. These findings have implications in relation to ethics, future XAI design, healthcare and further research. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The main objective in this proposal is to orchestrate an ecosystem of manipulation of reliable and safe data, applied to the field of health, specifically lung cancer, by introducing the creation of digital twins for personalised healthcare about the behaviour of this disease on patients. Digital twins is a very popular and novel approach in digitisation units in industry which will be used by both kind of experts: (i) data analysts, who will design expert recommender systems and extract knowledge – explainable Artificial Intelligence (AI); and (ii) professionals in medicine, who will consume that knowledge generated with their research for better diagnosis. This knowledge generation/extraction process will work in the form of a lifelong learning system by iterative and continuous use. The produced software platform will be abstracted so it can be applied like a general purpose service tool in other domains of knowledge, specially health and industry. Furthermore, a rule extraction module will be made available for explainability issues. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper deals with an AI implementation that uses knowledge in an original Construction Grammar (CG) format for deep understanding of text. CG is a means of processing knowledge pieces-aka constructions-that describe the form and meaning of text parts. Understanding consists in automatically finding in the text the knowledge that constructions contain and in creating knowledge networks that reflect the text information structure. Deeper understanding is achieved by propagating knowledge within the network, i.e. some constructions can share with others information about syntax, semantics, pragmatics and other text properties. A shortcoming of this information-rich method is limited coverage: only text for which a CG database is available can be understood; that database due to its complexity most often needs to be made up manually. The author attempts to increase the coverage by implementing automatic acquisition of word knowledge from sources such as an external (non-CG) knowledge base and formatting the knowledge as CG constructions. The resulting CG database has been used in evaluation experiments to understand the Winograd Schema (WS)-a test for AI. A 28% increase in accurate coverage and opportunities for further improvement are observed. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This work develops a methodology for creating and updating data-driven physics-based digital twins, and demonstrates the approach through the development of a structural digital twin for a 12ft wingspan unmanned aerial vehicle. The digital twin is built from a library of component-based reduced-order models that are derived from high-fidelity finite element simulations of the vehicle in a range of pristine and damaged states. In contrast with traditional monolithic techniques for model reduction, the component-based approach scales efficiently to large complex systems, and provides a flexible and expressive framework for rapid model adaptation—both critical features in the digital twin context. The digital twin is deployed and updated using interpretable machine learning. Specifically, we use optimal trees—a recently developed scalable machine learning method—to train an interpretable data-driven classifier. In operation, the classifier takes as input vehicle sensor data, and then infers which physics-based reduced models in the model library are the best candidates to compose an updated digital twin. In our example use case, the data-driven digital twin enables the aircraft to dynamically replan a safe mission in response to structural damage or degradation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - As an expert in decision support systems development, I have been promoting transparency and self-explanatory systems to close the plan-do-check-act cycle. AI adoption has tripled in 2018, moving AI towards the Gartner-hype-cycle peak. As AI is getting more mainstream, more conservative companies have good reasons to enter this arena. My impression is that the journey is starting all over again as organizations start using AI technology as black box systems. I think that eventually these companies will also start asking for methods that result in more reliable project outcomes and integrated business systems. The idea that explainable AI is at the expense of accuracy is deeply rooted in the AI community. Unfortunately, this has hampered research into good explainable models and indicates that the human factor in AI is underestimated. Driven by governments asking for transparency, a public asking for unbiased decision making and compliance requirements on business and industry, a new trend and research area is emerging. This talk will explain why explainable artificial intelligence is needed, what makes an explanation good and how ontologies, rule-based systems and knowledge representation may contribute to the research area named XAI. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This is paper proposes a knowledge construction system. The key objective of the system is to extract knowledge from structured data which is generally available in the form of electronic medical records (EMR). In this regard, the main focus of the research is to design and develop a domain-independent system that is capable of assisting the domain expert(s) in gaining non-trivial insights from the underlying EMR data. It is important to note that most of the research in the domain of cost-sensitive feature selection relies on black-box models which only provide a prediction of a final class label. Whereas, the goal of this research is to acquire insights for domain experts such as chronic kidney disease classification. This goal is achieved by designing and developing a knowledge construction system that is based on a two-stage methodology. Stage one deals with identifying salient cost-sensitive features in the EMR data, whereas, stage-two deals with consolidating knowledge (i.e. in the form of production rules) from a set of interpretable machine learning models. Finally, in order to demonstrate the efficacy of the system a chronic kidney disease case study is adopted. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A new challenge for knowledge graph reasoning started in 2018. Deep learning has promoted the application of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to a wide variety of social problems. Accordingly, being able to explain the reason for an AI decision is becoming important to ensure the secure and safe use of AI techniques. Thus, we, the Special Interest Group on Semantic Web and Ontology of the Japanese Society for AI, organized a challenge calling for techniques that reason and/or estimate which characters are criminals while providing a reasonable explanation based on an open knowledge graph of a well-known Sherlock Holmes mystery story. This paper presents a summary report of the first challenge held in 2018, including the knowledge graph construction, the techniques proposed for reasoning and/or estimation, the evaluation metrics, and the results. The first prize went to an approach that formalized the problem as a constraint satisfaction problem and solved it using a lightweight formal method; the second prize went to an approach that used SPARQL and rules; the best resource prize went to a submission that constructed word embedding of characters from all sentences of Sherlock Holmes novels; and the best idea prize went to a discussion multi-agents model. We conclude this paper with the plans and issues for the next challenge in 2019. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - As serious public health problems require complex responses, health interventions often involve multiple components implemented by groups including policy experts, social workers, and health practitioners. The success or failure of an intervention depends on many different factors, ranging from available resources to characteristics of the targeted public health issue and community to the complex mechanics relating cause and effects of the actions performed. In this paper, we present a novel formal methodology to evaluate public health interventions, policies, and programs. Our method uses the theory of change (TOC) approach along with logic models that define the intervention under consideration to generate a causal diagram and an ontology-based inference model for causal description. The resulting causal diagram will then be compared to existing knowledge and data to determine whether the intervention is coherent, internally consistent and its goals are achievable in the allotted time with the resources provided. The contextual knowledge and semantics provided by the ontology will generate a more explainable, understandable, and trustworthy approach to compare and assess different interventions based on their shared goals. Depending upon the quality and quantity of data available we perform a mix of qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the interventions. This study uses smoking cessation interventions to showcase the proposed methodology in action. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The progress in the field of Machine Learning (ML) has enabled the automation of tasks that were considered impossible to program until recently. These advancements today have incited firms to seek intelligent solutions as part of their enterprise software stack. Even governments across the globe are motivating firms through policies to tape into ML arena as it promises opportunities for growth, productivity and efficiency. In reflex, many firms embark on ML without knowing what it entails. The outcomes so far are not as expected because the ML, as hyped by tech firms, is not the silver bullet. However, whatever ML offers, firms urge to capitalise it for their competitive advantage. Applying ML to real-life construction industry problems goes beyond just prototyping predictive models. It entails intensive activities which, in addition to training robust ML models, provides a comprehensive framework for answering questions asked by construction folks when intelligent solutions are getting deployed at their premises to substitute or facilitate their decision-making tasks. Existing ML guidelines used in the IT industry are vastly restricted to training ML models. This paper presents guidelines for Applied Machine Learning (AML) in the construction industry from training to operationalising models, which are drawn from our experience of working with construction folks to deliver Construction Simulation Tool (CST). The unique aspect of these guidelines lies not only in providing a novel framework for training models but also answering critical questions related to model confidence, trust, interpretability, bias, feature importance and model extrapolation capabilities. Generally, ML models are presumed black boxes; hence argued that nobody knows what a model learns and how it generates predictions. Even very few ML folks barely know approaches to answer questions asked by the end users. Without explaining the competence of ML, the broader adoption of intelligent solutions in the construction industry cannot be attained. This paper proposed a detailed process for AML to develop intelligent solutions in the construction industry. Most discussions in the study are elaborated in the context of profit margin estimation for new projects. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Feature engineering and data-driven classification models are at the forefront of analysis of large temporal sensor data from the built environment. In previous efforts, temporal features were engineered from the whole building hourly electrical meter data from 507 non-residential buildings. These features fall within the three general categories of statistics, model, and pattern-based and can be used to identify various behavior in the structure of the whole building electrical meter data. In this paper, a deeper investigation is made of exactly what types of behavior are most important in the context of two classification scenarios: the primary use of a building and the level of performance the building has when compared to its peers. The highly comparative time-series analysis (hctsa) toolkit is used to analyze the most important temporal features for the classification of various building performance attributes. In the first analysis, a comparison is made to distinguish the behavior between university dormitories (70 buildings) and laboratories (95 buildings) as an example of interpreting the classification of the primary-use-type of a building. In the second analysis, a comparison of buildings with high (165 buildings) versus low (169 buildings) consumption is used to extract and understand the behavior that indicates the level of the energy performance of a building. These two case study examples provide a foundation for further explainable machine learning techniques in both classification and prediction as applied to buildings. This effort is the first example of machine learning with an explicit focus on the interpretability of classification for smart meter data from non-residential buildings. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The main aim of this short position paper is to introduce a proposal to orchestrate an ecosystem of manipulation of reliable and safe data, applied to the field of health, proposing the creation of digital twins for personalised healthcare. These will be used by both kind of experts: (i) data analysts, who will design expert recommender systems and extract knowledge (explainable AI); and (ii) professionals in medicine, who will consume that knowledge generated with their research for better diagnosis. Knowledge generation / extraction processes will work in the form of a lifelong learning system by iterative and continuous use. The produced platform would be abstracted so it can be applied like a general purpose service tool in other domains. A rule extraction module would be also made available. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Requirements classification is a traditional application of machine learning (ML) to RE that helps handle large requirements datasets. A prime example of an RE classification problem is the distinction between functional and non-functional (quality) requirements. State-of-the-art classifiers build their effectiveness on a large set of word features like text n-grams or POS n-grams, which do not fully capture the essence of a requirement. As a result, it is arduous for human analysts to interpret the classification results by exploring the classifier's inner workings. We propose the use of more general linguistic features, such as dependency types, for the construction of interpretable ML classifiers for RE. Through a feature engineering effort, in which we are assisted by modern introspection tools that reveal the hidden inner workings of ML classifiers, we derive a set of 17 linguistic features. While classifiers that use our proposed features fit the training set slightly worse than those that use high-dimensional feature sets, our approach performs generally better on validation datasets and it is more interpretable. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Our interest in this paper is in the construction of symbolic explanations for predictions made by a deep neural network. We will focus attention on deep relational machines (DRMs: A term introduced in Lodhi (2013)). A DRM is a deep network in which the input layer consists of Boolean-valued functions (features) that are defined in terms of relations provided as domain, or background, knowledge. Our DRMs differ from those in Lodhi (2013), which uses an Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) engine to first select features (we use random selections from a space of features that satisfies some approximate constraints on logical relevance and non-redundancy). But why do the DRMs predict what they do? One way of answering this was provided in recent work Ribeiro et al. (2016), by constructing readable proxies for a black-box predictor. The proxies are intended only to model the predictions of the black-box in local regions of the instance-space. But readability alone may not be enough: To be understandable, the local models must use relevant concepts in an meaningful manner. We investigate the use of a Bayes-like approach to identify logical proxies for local predictions of a DRM. As a preliminary step, we show that DRM's with our randomised propositionalization method achieve predictive performance that is comparable to the best reports in the ILP literature. Our principal results on logical explanations show: (a) Models in first-order logic can approximate the DRM's prediction closely in a small local region; and (b) Expert-provided relevance information can play the role of a prior to distinguish between logical explanations that perform equivalently on prediction alone. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The recent years have witnessed a growing anticipation for the positive transformation of industries which adopt Artificial Intelligence (AI) for the core areas of their business activities. However, the effectiveness and reliability of such AI systems must comprise the ability to explain their data acquisition, the underlying algorithms operations and the final decisions to stakeholders, including regulators, risk managers, supervisors and end-users among others. There are plenty of areas where Explainable AI (XAI) holds the promise to be a major disruptor. Particularly, in Telecommunication Service Providers (TSPs) which is a core business activity relating to the workforce allocation domain, which, involves costly and time-consuming scheduling processes. This paper focuses on the construction of an XAI framework to assist workforce allocation based on a big bang- big crunch interval type-2 fuzzy logic system (BB-BC IT2FLS) for modelling and scaling goal-driven simulation (GDS) problems, specifically within the telecommunications industry. The obtained results reported the proposed XAI system produces similar results to opaque box models like Neural Networks (NNs) and LSTM Recurrent NNs while being able to explain the decision and operation of the employed system. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Intensive-care units (ICUs) treat the most critically ill patients, which is complicated by the heterogeneity of the diseases that they encounter. Severity scores based mainly on acute physiology measures collected at ICU admission are used to predict mortality, but are non-specific, and predictions for individual patients can be inaccurate. We investigated whether inclusion of long-term disease history before ICU admission improves mortality predictions. Methods: Registry data for long-term disease histories for more than 230 000 Danish ICU patients were used in a neural network to develop an ICU mortality prediction model. Long-term disease histories and acute physiology measures were aggregated to predict mortality risk for patients for whom both registry and ICU electronic patient record data were available. We compared mortality predictions with admission scores on the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II, the Acute Physiologic Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II, and the best available multimorbidity score, the Multimorbidity Index. An external validation set from an additional hospital was acquired after model construction to confirm the validity of our model. During initial model development data were split into a training set (85%) and an independent test set (15%), and a five-fold cross-validation was done during training to avoid overfitting. Neural networks were trained for datasets with disease history of 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2·5 years, 5 years, 7·5 years, 10 years, and 23 years before ICU admission. Findings: Mortality predictions with a model based solely on disease history outperformed the Multimorbidity Index (Matthews correlation coefficient 0·265 vs 0·065), and performed similarly to SAPS II and APACHE II (Matthews correlation coefficient with disease history, age, and sex 0·326 vs 0·347 and 0·300 for SAPS II and APACHE II, respectively). Diagnoses up to 10 years before ICU admission affected current mortality prediction. Aggregation of previous disease history and acute physiology measures in a neural network yielded the most precise predictions of in-hospital mortality (Matthews correlation coefficient 0·391 for in-hospital mortality compared with 0·347 with SAPS II and 0·300 with APACHE II). These results for the aggregated model were validated in an external independent dataset of 1528 patients (Matthews correlation coefficient for prediction of in-hospital mortality 0·341). Interpretation: Longitudinal disease-spectrum-wide data available before ICU admission are useful for mortality prediction. Disease history can be used to differentiate mortality risk between patients with similar vital signs with more precision than SAPS II and APACHE II scores. Machine learning models can be deconvoluted to generate novel understandings of how ICU patient features from long-term and short-term events interact with each other. Explainable machine learning models are key in clinical settings, and our results emphasise how to progress towards the transformation of advanced models into actionable, transparent, and trustworthy clinical tools.

AB  - As predictive models increasingly assist human experts (e.g., doctors) in day-to-day decision making, it is crucial for experts to be able to explore and understand how such models behave in different feature subspaces in order to know if and when to trust them. To this end, we propose Model Understanding through Subspace Explanations (MUSE), a novel model agnostic framework which facilitates understanding of a given black box model by explaining how it behaves in subspaces characterized by certain features of interest. Our framework provides end users (e.g., doctors) with the flexibility of customizing the model explanations by allowing them to input the features of interest. The construction of explanations is guided by a novel objective function that we propose to simultaneously optimize for fidelity to the original model, unambiguity and interpretability of the explanation. More specifically, our objective allows us to learn, with optimality guarantees, a small number of compact decision sets each of which captures the behavior of a given black box model in unambiguous, well-defined regions of the feature space. Experimental evaluation with real-world datasets and user studies demonstrate that our approach can generate customizable, highly compact, easy-to-understand, yet accurate explanations of various kinds of predictive models compared to state-of-the-art baselines. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In the paper, fuzzy recommender systems are proposed based on the novel method for nominal attribute coding. Several flexibility parameters - subjects to learning - are incorporated to their construction, allowing systems to better represent patterns encoded in data. The learning process does not affect the initial interpretable form of fuzzy recommenders rules. Using the Akaike Information Criterion allows evaluating the trade-off between a number of rules and interpretability which is crucial to provide proper explanations for users. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Argument detection and its representation through ontologies are important parts of today’s attempt in automated recognition and processing of useful information in the vast amount of constantly produced data. However, due to the highly complex nature of an argument and its characteristics, its automated recognition is hard to implement. Given this overall challenge, as part of the objectives of the RecomRatio project, we are interested in the traceable, automated stance detection of arguments, to enable the construction of explainable pro/con argument ontologies. In our research, we design and evaluate an explainable machine learning based classifier, trained on two publicly available data sets. The evaluation results proved that explainable argument stance recognition is possible with up to .96 F1 when working within the same set of topics and .6 F1 when working with entirely different topics. This informed our hypothesis, that there are two sets of features in argument stance recognition: General features and topic specific features. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A Systems Engineer’s Virtual Assistant (SEVA) is a novel attempt to bridge the gap between Natural Language Processing (NLP), Knowledge Base (KB) Construction research, and NASA’s Systems Engineering domain. In this work, we propose the design of an explainable, human-in-the-loop, and interactive personal assistant system. The assistant will help a Systems Engineer in their daily work environment through complex information management and high-level question-answering to augment their problem-solving abilities. We describe the fundamental characteristics of the assistant by understanding operational, functional, and system requirements from Systems Engineers and NASA’s Systems Engineering Handbook. The assistant is designed to act as a workbench to manage dynamic information about projects and analyze hypothetical scenarios. It is also designed to make logical inferences and perform temporal reasoning by handling domain information and information related to schedule and resources. In addition, the system learns new information over time by interacting with its user and can perform case-based reasoning from previous experiences. The knowledge base design describes a novel hybrid approach to build a domain-independent common-sense framework with which domain-specific engineers can attune it and build their projects. Using these specific objectives and constraints, the architecture of a personal assistant is proposed. Main contributions of this design paper are Systems Engineering (SE) domain analysis, a survey of existing research, preliminary experiments using the state-of-the-art systems to explore the feasibility, a proposal of a complete architecture with component level detail, and identification of areas that require further research and development. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Machine learning (ML) models are often considered “blackboxes” as their internal representations fail to align with human understanding. While recent work attempted to expose the inner workings of ML models they do not allow users to interact directly with the model. This is especially problematic in domains where labeled data is limited as such the generalizability of ML models becomes questionable. We argue that the fundamental problem of general-izibility could be addressed by making ML models explainable in abstractions and expressions that make sense to users and by allowing them to interact with the model to assess, select, and build on. By involving humans in the process this way, we argue that the co-created models will be more generalizable as they extrapolate what ML learns from few data when expressed in higher level abstractions that humans can verify, update, and expand based on their domain expertise. In this paper, we introduce RulesLearner that expresses ML model as rules on top of semantic linguistic structures in disjunctive normal form. RulesLearner allows users to interact with the patterns learned by the ML model, e.g. add and remove predicates, examine precision and recall, and construct a trusted set of rules. We conducted a preliminary user study which suggests that (1) rules learned by ML are explainable and (2) co-created model is more generalizable (3) providing rules to experts improves overall productivity, with fewer people involved, with less expertise. Our findings link explainability and interactivity to generalizability, as such suggest that hybrid intelligence (human-AI) methods offer great potential. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Defeasible argumentation has advanced as a solid theoretical research discipline for inference under uncertainty. Scholars have predominantly focused on the construction of argument-based models for demonstrating non-monotonic reasoning adopting the notions of arguments and conflicts. However, they have marginally attempted to examine the degree of explainability that this approach can offer to explain inferences to humans in real-world applications. Model explanations are extremely important in areas such as medical diagnosis because they can increase human trustworthiness towards automatic inferences. In this research, the inferential processes of defeasible argumentation and non-monotonic fuzzy reasoning are meticulously described, exploited and qualitatively compared. A number of properties have been selected for such a comparison including understandability, simulatability, algorithmic transparency, post-hoc interpretability, computational complexity and extensibility. Findings show how defeasible argumentation can lead to the construction of inferential non-monotonic models with a higher degree of explainability compared to those built with fuzzy reasoning. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Planning is a classic problem in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Recently, the need for creating “Explainable AI” has been recognised and voiced by many researchers. Leveraging on the strength of argumentation, in particular, the Related Admissible semantics for generating explanations, this work makes an initial step towards “explainable planning”. We illustrate (1) how plan generation can be equated to constructing acceptable arguments and (2) how explanations for both “planning solutions” as well as “invalid plans” can be obtained by extracting information from an arguing process. We present an argumentation-based model which takes plans written in a STRIPS-like language as its inputs and returns Assumption-based Argumentation (ABA) frameworks as its outputs. The presented plan construction mapping is both sound and complete in that the planning problem has a solution if and only if its corresponding ABA framework has a set of Related Admissible arguments with the planning goal as its topic. We use the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle as our case study and demonstrate how ABA can be used to solve this planning puzzle while giving explanations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper addresses the issues of explainability of case-based support systems, particularly structural CBR systems dominated by knowledge-rich comprehensive cases and domain models. We show how explanation patterns and contextually enriched explanations of retrieval results can provide human-understandable insights on the system behavior, justify the shown results, and recommend the best cases to be considered for further use. We applied and implemented our approach as an agent-based system module within a case-based assistance framework for support of the early conceptual phases in architectural design, taking a single floor plan as a case with a high number of attributes. For the retrieval phase, a semantic search pattern structure, Semantic Fingerprint, was applied, whereas the explanation generation phase is controlled by a number of explanation patterns adapted from already existing explanation goals. Rulesets, case bases, and natural language generation are used for construction and automatic revision of explanation expressions. A contextualization feature categorizes the results into different context classes and includes this information into the explanation. A user study we conducted after the implementation of the explanation algorithm resulted in good acceptance by the representatives of the architectural domain, a quantitative experiment revealed a high rate of valid generated explanations and a reasonable distribution of patterns and contexts. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Acute myocardial infarction is a major cause of hospitalization and mortality in China, where ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is more severe and has a higher mortality rate. Accurate and interpretable prediction of in-hospital mortality is critical for STEMI patient clinical decision making. In this study, we used interpretable machine learning approaches to build in-hospital mortality prediction models for STEMI patients from Chinese Acute Myocardial Infarction (CAMI) registry data. We first performed cohort construction and feature engineering on CAMI data to generate an available dataset and identify potential predictors. Then several supervised learning methods with good interpretability, including generalized linear models, decision tree models, and Bayes models, were applied to build prediction models. The experimental results show that our models achieve higher prediction performance (A UC = 0.80∼0.85) than the previous in-hospital mortality prediction STEMI models and are also easily interpretable for clinical decision support. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The South East Asia Community Access Programme (SEACAP) aimed to identify cost-effective, community-oriented approaches for improving year-round access to remote rural areas. The program promoted low-cost and local resource-based improvements to roads. In 2007, trial surfacing sections were constructed on seven low-volume rural roads (LVRRs) near Houay Xai in Bokeo Province, northwest Laos. The surfaces included concrete, bituminous seals, stone, and gravel. The research sites were monitored after construction in 2007 and once more in 2009. However, after 2009 no funding was available to continue the monitoring and there was a risk of valuable knowledge being 'ost. To avoid that outcome, the African Community Access Programme (AFCAP) funded a third monitoring visit, which took place in October 2012. The objective was to assess the performance of the trial sections after they had been trafficked for S years. The information will be used ,0 supplement knowledge gathered from a project in Tanzania, where demonstration sections have also been constructed and are being monitored. A separate paper on their performance has also been prepared. The present paper outlines the main findings from the monitoring pro-cess in Laos and makes some recommendations on the basis or these findings, particularly in relation to surfacing and pavement choice for LVRRS.

AB  - Many real world complex problems can be viewed as networks with arc capacities, for example, rail networks, or supply chains, in which system throughput needs to be maximized. Arcs in such a network represent important components of the corresponding system, the condition of which may degrade over time. Maintenance of these components (arcs of the network) is important to maintain their productivity. But every maintenance activity incurs some loss of productivity as the arc will be unavailable during its maintenance. To obtain maximum throughput, it is important to select the schedule that leads to minimum loss of flow. In this paper we discuss optimization models for scheduling arc maintenance so as to maximize the throughput of the network, and focus on the case in which each maintenance task requires a single period and the network has a single transshipment node. We note that even this case is strongly NP-hard. Mathematically the problem is defined over a network N = (V, A, s, t, u) with node set V , arc set A, source s ∈ V , sink t ∈ V and nonnegative integral capacity vector u = (u<inf>a</inf>)<inf>a</inf>∈A. We permit parallel arcs, i.e. there may exist more than one arc in A having the same start and end node. By δ−(v) and δ+(v) we denote the set of incoming and outgoing arcs of node v, respectively. We consider this network over a set of T time periods indexed by the set [T]:= {1, 2, . . ., T}, and our objective is to maximize the total flow from s to t. In addition, we are given a subset J ⊆ A of arcs that have to be shut down for exactly one time period in the time horizon. In other words, there is a set of maintenance jobs, one for each arc in J, each with unit processing time. Our optimization problem is to choose these outage time periods in such a way that the total flow from s to t is maximized. More formally, this can be written as a mixed binary program as follows: (Equation presented) where x<inf>ai</inf> ≥ 0 for a ∈ A and i ∈ [T] denotes the flow on arc a in time period i, and y<inf>ai</inf> ∈ {0, 1} for a ∈ J and i ∈ [T] indicates when the arc a is not shut down for maintenance in time period i. We present a branch-and-bound algorithm called the “Partial-State algorithm” to solve the problem for single transhipment node networks i.e. networks with |V | = 3. Unit processing time of each job leads to formation of symmetries in the solution space. We include powerful symmetry breaking rules in the algorithm to make it more efficient. We provide an easily-computer combinatorial expression that is proved to give the value of LP-relaxation of the problem at each node of the branch-and-bound tree. We also provide another upper bound which is even stronger than the LP value at each node of the tree, and show how this improves the run time of the algorithm. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
