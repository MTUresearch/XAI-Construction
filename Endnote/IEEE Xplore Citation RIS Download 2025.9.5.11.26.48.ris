AB  - Industrial maintenance is crucial for companies due to its significant impact on operational costs and efficiency. Many industrial firms find that a substantial portion of their expenses stems from equipment breakdowns, failures, or suboptimal performance over time. These costs can sometimes account for up to 50% of overall expenditures. Additionally, companies face various losses, including downtime from breakdowns, challenges in inventory and purchase management, and potential risks of injuries. The objective of this writing is to investigate how Predive maintenance is a footstep towards industry 5.0 where automation of predictive maintenance is evolved to autonomy in maintenance. In addition to it various machine learning algorithms are suggested to identify between healthy and poor data of a machine which is first step in Predictive maintenance then Deep learning algorithms to construct XAI (Explainable artificial Intelligence). Predictive maintenance, production scheduling, problem detection, predictive quality, and increased energy efficiency are highlighted in the typical use cases of the selected AI applications. Data from the real environment is transmitted to be virtually recreated. Efficient industrial maintenance helps mitigate these costs by reducing downtime, improving equipment reliability, and lowering the need for emergency repairs. By implementing a well-designed and optimized maintenance strategy, production plants can ensure their equipment operates as reliably as possible, minimizing disruptions and enhancing overall operational efficiency. Machine Learning (ML) methods have been appeared as a crucial tool in Predictive Maintenance (PdM) applications to prevent failures in equipment that make up the production lines. However, the performance of PdM applications depends on the appropriate choice of the ML method. To save expenses, find inefficiencies, duplicate tool tracking systems, and do other tasks, Digital Twin evaluates material utilization. Manufacturers create a digital duplicate of any product or system, set of tools and equipment, proprietary goods or processes, or anything else. Their goal is to make the factory floor better. sensors and additional devices that gather real-time.

AB  - In this study, we analyzed environmental elements and the photovoltaic (PV) output utilizing the power generation data from a PV facility in 2021 and concurrent environmental observation data. The outcomes of the environmental factors analysis reveal that the PV output power and solar irradiance exhibit a similar trend, fluctuating in accordance with solar irradiance. Both demonstrate daily variations with single-peak fluctuations, peaking at midday. Although the variations in PV output power align with environmental temperature and wind speed changes, a notable distinction emerges in June-July. While daily changes in environmental temperature and wind speed also manifest single-peak fluctuations, there exists a time lag between these fluctuations and those in PV output power. Interestingly, the PV output power exhibits an inverse relationship with ambient relative humidity, which follows a "U" type fluctuation pattern. The impact of environmental factors on PV output power underscores that solar irradiance and scattered radiation exert the most significant influence, followed by environmental temperature and average wind speed, both exhibiting positive correlations. Conversely, environmental humidity negatively affects power generation.

AB  - Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a fast-progressing blood cancer marked by uncontrolled proliferation of immature lymphoid cells. Although modern treatment options such as chemotherapy and immunotherapy have increased survival rates, recurrence and drug resistance remain critical challenges. In this study, we present a novel explainable deep learning framework for predicting protein-ligand interactions and identifying repositionable drugs for this disease. Among the five tested architectures, a regularized Bi-LSTM + Bi-LSTM ensemble achieved the best performance, with a test mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.041 and a test loss of 0.210, outperforming other models. Explainability techniques such as Integrated Gradients and LIME revealed key sequence features in both SMILES and protein data contributing to predictions. Molecular docking validation using PandaDock confirmed strong binding affinities for selected ligands, such as Copanlisib (-207.11 kcal/mol) and Dutasteride (-171.17 kcal/mol), in alignment with model outputs. Literature-based evidence further supported the therapeutic relevance of identified compounds. This study demonstrates that explainable deep learning combined with molecular docking provides a robust strategy for drug repositioning in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

AB  - Market trend research is essential for taking advantage of the best investing opportunities to maximize profits and the quickest way to minimize losses, because stock forecasting is complex and fraught with dangers and uncertainties. All five of the following stock-market trends—upward, downward, double-top, and rounded-top—can be predicted using our proposed deep learning model. Average accuracy for the suggested model is $94.9 \%$, which is higher than common benchmarks like logistic-regression (53.41%), random-forest ($85.14 \%$), and support-vector-machine (62.56). In addition, across four real-world heterogeneous datasets, the suggested model outperforms the competition in terms of F1-score, with a performance of $94.85 \%$. In comparison, RF achieved $77.95 \%$, SVM $21.02 \%$, and LR $46.23 \%$. In order to make the forecasts more understandable to stakeholders, we also use SHAP and LIME, two XAI approaches, to improve interpretability. By identifying the ten most significant characteristics, the SHAP analysis allows for feature reduction without sacrificing performance. This study's findings show promise for real-world use in financial decision-making by helping investors with risk management and long-term planning through a combination of interpretability and predictive power.

AB  - Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA’s) have been employed by botnet orchestrators for controlling infected hosts (bots), while evading detection by performing multiple DNS requests, mostly for non-existing domain names. With blacklists ineffective, modern DGA filtering methods rely on Machine Learning (ML). Emerging needs for higher intrusion detection accuracy lead to complex, non-interpretable black-box classifiers, thus requiring eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques. In this paper, we utilize SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) to derive model-agnostic, post-hoc interpretations on DGA name classifiers. This method is applied to binary supervised tree-based classifiers (e.g. eXtreme Gradient Boosting - XGBoost) and deep neural networks (Multi-Layer Perceptron - MLP) to assess domain name feature importance. SHAP visualization tools (summary, dependence, force plots) are used to rank features, investigate their effect on model decisions and determine their interactions. Specific interpretations are detailed for identifying names belonging to common DGA families pertaining to arithmetic, wordlist, hash and permutation based schemes. Learning and interpretations are based on up-to-date datasets, such as Tranco for benign and DGArchive for malicious names. Domain name features are extracted from dataset instances, thus limiting time-consuming and privacy-invasive database operations on historical data. Our experimental results demonstrate that SHAP enables explanations of XGBoost (the most accurate tree-based model) and MLP classifiers and indicates the characteristics of specific DGA schemes, commonly employed in attacks. In conclusion, we envision that XAI methods will expedite ML deployment in networking environments where justifications for black-box models are required.

AB  - In recent years, industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPS) have advanced rapidly, resulting in sophisticated and intelligent networks of industrial devices and systems. These networks, while offering increased efficiency and interconnectivity, have become susceptible to sophisticated cyber threats. Traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) fall short of effectively identifying and mitigating these challenges due to the multifaceted nature of modern attacks and the complexity of ICPS. This paper introduces an explainable AI-based intrusion detection system (XAI-IDS), specifically designed to enhance security in ICPS. The purpose of this study is to propose an ensemble-based filter feature selection method (EFFS) for selecting the most relevant features and then use Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) to evaluate the impact of the different features on the prediction. Additionally, we utilise an optimised classifier based on GRULSTM to determine intrusions into the ICPS network and classify attacks efficiently. We use Bayesian optimisation as the hyperparameter optimizer to fine-tune the GRU-LSTM model. Furthermore, our approach improves previous systems in attack detection accuracy, false-positive rate, and computational complexity.

AB  - The science of data mining has contributed considerably to the education sector. However, most educational data mining (EDM) studies have focused on predicting the future performance of students and detecting at-risk students to provide early targeted interventions. A few studies used machine learning techniques to predict the future academic pathways for degree students. However, there are limited studies that use the datasets of high school students to predict future pathways. Moreover, such studies are yet to be conducted using datasets produced in Saudi high schools. Therefore, researchers that work in the education sector have focused on EDM and are eager to apply advanced computer science methods to upgrade old administrative systems. Furthermore, the education sector is a rich field with data that can be exploited to improve and enhance educational management systems and accelerate digital transformation. In this study, we explore the applications of EDM and review the algorithms used by other researchers in this field. We applied supervised machine learning classifiers to educational datasets collected from high schools in Saudi to predict the future academic pathways of students and identify the essential factors that affect them. This study contributes to the literature by developing a predictive model for students in Saudi high schools and detecting critical features that affect future academic careers of the students. Furthermore, we used explainable artificial intelligence to interpret the best model and enhance its transparency.

AB  - The advent of widespread AI in the field of corporate planning has sparked a revolutionary shift, ushering in previously unimaginable possibilities for efficacy and data-driven decision-making. This evolution, however, is not without of moral consequences. Our increasingly AI-powered environment has elevated the need of considering the ethical implications of AI application in company strategy. Incorporating sophisticated fairness criteria, bias reduction strategies, transparency evaluations, and legal framework compliance, this study examines the varied terrain of AI ethics.The research shows that achieving justice and openness in AI systems requires constant juggling, with model accuracy typically taking a backseat. Concerns about potentially unfair AI-driven conclusions are met with effective solutions for bias reduction, such as reweighing and resampling. Improving AI model interpretability by feature-level transparency evaluation using SHAP values. Also, AI has been shown to be ethically and legally compliant, as shown by its high compliance ratings with legislation like the General Data Protection Regulation and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s requirements.These results provide useful insights for corporate executives, legislators, and the general public as they pertain to using AI in an ethical manner. The full potential of AI may be realized by enterprises while maintaining ethical standards if the correct balance is struck between fairness and openness, investment is made in bias prevention, and regulatory compliance is encouraged. In this study, we focus on how artificial intelligence might be reimagined from its current state as a potentially biased and opaque planning tool to one that drives ethical excellence in corporate strategy.This study acts as a catalyst for change by advocating for ethical and responsible AI deployment, which in turn creates a climate in which judgments influenced by AI are more fair, open, and lawful. These findings will serve as a springboard for other studies and activities that will push for more ethical AI development and use in company strategy.

AB  - Modern agriculture faces critical challenges, including climate change induced water shortage, inefficient resource utilization, and reducing soil health which reduce sustainability and reduce crop yields. Traditional farming methods, dependent on manual observation and generalized practices, often lack the precision needed to address these growing issues. To meet these demands, this study presents an artificial intelligence (AI) powered smart agriculture system that integrates deep learning (DL), Internet of Things (IoT), and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to enable intelligent, data-driven farming. This study addresses key challenges such as ineffective soil management, poor irrigation practices, and the absence of personalized crop and fertilizer recommendations. IoT-based sensors provide real-time soil analysis, measuring critical parameters such as nutrient levels, moisture, and temperature. Advanced DL models were employed for various tasks in the AI-Driven Smart Agriculture System. The Transformer-based Tabular Learning (TTL) model for irrigation advice gives an accuracy of 99.13%. For soil analysis, the TabNet regressor achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.51 and an R2 score of 98.7%, while XAI techniques were used to explain and interpret its predictions. The Sparse Weighted Fusion Transformer (SwiFT) model for crop recommendation gives an accuracy of 98.75%. For fertilizer recommendation, the TabNet classifier achieved an accuracy of 99.3%, with XAI techniques applied to explain the reasoning behind its predictions. These results demonstrate that the system delivers precise and actionable insights. A weather Application Programming Interface (API) is integrated to support timely irrigation decisions through accurate forecasting. A chatbot interface is also added which enhances system usability, accessibility and user-friendliness for farmers. The proposed model improves crop productivity, optimizes resource use, and supports adaptation to environmental changes. By leveraging AI and IoT technologies, the proposed model gives a solution which helps in sustainable agriculture, environmental resilience, and global food security, thus benefiting stakeholders ranging from individual farmers to large-scale agricultural business. Future work will explore real-time adaptive control mechanisms and expand model generalization across diverse geographical region.

AB  - Classification of carrot variety is a very important task in agriculture, which is used for crop management optimization, quality control, and breeding program improvement. Like many other methods of classification, traditional methods rely on manual inspection which is laborious and prone to human error. To address these challenges, this research proposes a hybrid deep learning (DL) model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction with a Random Forest (RF) classifier for accurate and interpretable classification of four carrot varieties: Pusa Kesar Pusa Meghali Pusa Yamdagni, Pusa Rudhira. We collected and preprocessed a dataset of 8000 carrot images of which each variety has 2000 images. To assure generalization to real-world conditions, data augmentation techniques were performed to make the model more robust. Assuming accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, the hybrid CNN-RF model was trained and evaluated using it. All carrot varieties were scored with very high accuracy and recall using the model, with an overall accuracy of 92.6%. The model balanced between false positives and false negatives resulting in F1 scores between 91.8% and 93.2%. Furthermore, the hybrid model had higher classification accuracy when compared to some state-of-the-art techniques, namely standalone CNN, support vector machine (SVM), and k -k-nearest neighbors (k-NN).

AB  - For highly sensitive products such as pharmaceuticals, quality is a decisive factor in ensuring the therapeutic benefit that consumers expect and not jeopardizing consumers' health. So far, the quality control of pharmaceuticals is largely performed manually by qualified individuals. However, this is a time-consuming, repetitive, and error-prone process subject to natural performance fluctuations. To contribute to addressing this issue, we present an automated quality control approach for pharmaceutical capsules using a transfer learning-based convolutional neural network with a balanced accuracy of 97.27%, outperforming all current benchmarks. To increase trust in the model predictions, we incorporated two explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods into our approach.

AB  - This study aims at providing a conceptualized framework for railway to realize the Digital Twin (DT) beyond traditional structural modeling or information systems. First, we deduce a generic formula that shows that DT estimates the future states and decides actions beforehand. Then, based on this formula, we design a generic framework called RailTwin. The framework combines the insight of current states, the foresight representing the prediction of the future states, and the oversight based on the current and future state to enable automation and actuation. The key enabler of this framework to obtain these states is Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, including Deep Learning, Transfer Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Explainable AI. We present a use case for asset health inspection and monitoring through the proposed framework.

Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is concerned with the development of intelligent systems and robots that can explain and justify their actions, decisions, recommendations, and so on. However, the cooperative construction of explanations remains a key but under-explored issue. This short paper proposes an architecture for intelligent systems that promotes a co-constructive and interactive approach to explanation generation. By outlining its basic components and their specific roles, we aim to contribute to the advancement of XAI computational frameworks that actively engage users in the explanation process.

AB  - This paper presents an interpretable machine-learning model for anomaly detection in door locks using torque data. The model aims to replace the human tactile sense in the quality control process, reducing repetitive tasks and improving reliability. The model achieved an accuracy of 96%, however, to gain social acceptance and operators' trust, interpretability of the model is crucial. The purpose of this study was to evaluate an approach that can improve interpretability of anomalous classifications obtained from an anomaly detection model. We evaluate four instance-based counterfactual explanators, three of which, employ optimization techniques and one uses, a less complex, weighted nearest neighbor approach, which serve as our baseline. The former approaches, leverage a latent representation of the data, using a weighted principal component analysis, improving plausibility of the counter factual explanations and reduces computational cost. The explanations are presented together with the 5-50-95th percentile range of the training data, acting as a frame of reference to improve interpretability. All approaches successfully presented valid and plausible counterfactual explanations. However, instance-based approaches employing optimization techniques yielded explanations with greater similarity to the observations and was therefore concluded to be preferable despite the higher execution times (4-16s) compared to the baseline approach (0.1s). The findings of this study hold significant value for the lock industry and can potentially be extended to other industrial settings using timeseries data, serving as a valuable point of departure for further research.

AB  - Thermal comfort is a key consideration in smart buildings and a number of comfort models are available nowadays to evaluate the comfort level of occupants. However, the models are often complex and hardly interpretable for the developers and operators. Indeed, the model interpretations are beneficial in multifold such as for system inspection and optimization. In this article, we propose an interpretable thermal comfort system to introduce interpretability to any black-box comfort models. First, we focus on the relationship between a model’s input features and output comfort level. The feature impact on comfort is investigated and the impact patterns are shown to be diverse for different features. Second, we unveil the model mechanisms about the data processing inside the model by building the model surrogates based on the interpretable machine learning algorithms. The surrogates offer outstanding fidelity for simulating the actual model mechanisms and the interpretations based on the surrogates are intuitive and informative. Our interpretable comfort system can be integrated with the existing building management systems. Accordingly, we can ease building owner’s concerns about adopting new black-box technologies and enable various smart building applications like smart energy management.

AB  - This research expounds on the efficacy and impact of a machine learning-based approach in managing the investment services projects of the International Finance Corporation (IFC). It is achieved by focusing on the impact of financial interventions and project completion. We used a detailed dataset to assess trends in project status over time. The details about the growth of completed and active projects and the fluctuations in pending stages, like signing, disbursement, and approval are available in the dataset. We experimented with the ML models, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, SVC, and Decision Tree, to predict project outcomes. These models are evaluated with the metrics such as, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC. After rigorous experiments, we observed that Gradient Boosting achieved the highest accuracy (90.76%) and Random Forest closely followed (90.43%). We identified significant trends that include a high success rate in project completion, an incremental growth in active projects, and a low occurrence of hold and pending approval statuses. We also performed statistical analysis and observed that loans dominate IFC's financial support and risk management and guarantees see less use. Additionally, correlations between total investments and other financial products highlight a diversified investment strategy. The findings emphasize opportunities for improving project approval efficiency, managing bottlenecks, and implementing data-driven decision-making to optimize investment strategies and enhance sustainable development outcomes. This research offers actionable insights for policymakers, demonstrating how ML can improve project management processes and maximize the impact of IFC investments in developing economies.

AB  - Schizophrenia exists as a challenging neurological condition that produces major effects on mental health and intellectual ability. The current diagnostic methods display low accuracy levels combined with poor interpretability so deep learning methods must be developed for proper risk assessment. The proposed model combines CNNs with Transformers and implements SHAP values and attention maps for improving model interpretability. A combination of EEG MRI and genetic biomarkers made up the schizophrenia dataset that served for both model training and testing operations. The experimental findings showed 92.4% accuracy together with 91.2% precision while recall reached 90.7% under tests that produced an AUC-ROC value of 95.8% which exceeded existing benchmark models. Through this framework, healthcare professionals obtain clinically meaningful explanations regarding biomarkers that affect schizophrenia diagnosis determination. The proposed method demonstrates better diagnostic reliability and transparency than standard deep learning techniques operate today. It indicates explainable AI systems help close the gap between deep learning approaches and clinical decisions leading to better understanding and effective application of schizophrenia risk assessment by medical personnel.

AB  - Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic condition that, if not addressed, can be lethal. AI is immensely benefiting the healthcare industry. When identified early, diabetes can save countless lives. Generating decisions, identifying diabetes, and generating predictions about it have all been more popular in recent years. Diabetes prediction has been the subject of many publications, and new information and techniques are constantly being developed.The application of ML and DL techniques to diabetes research has recently received interest. Nonetheless, very few studies provide a comprehensive view of the knowledge generating ecosystem in this sector. To address this, scientific mapping was carried out utilising bibliometric methodology, which is based on procedures for estimating, quantifying, tracking, and assessing scientific publications published between 2014 and 2024 to identify worldwide research trends and networks, as well as to highlight the most notable nations, institutions, journals, articles, and major themes in this sector.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming pervasive in most engineering domains, and railway transport is no exception. However, due to the plethora of different new terms and meanings associated with them, there is a risk that railway practitioners, as several other categories, will get lost in those ambiguities and fuzzy boundaries, and hence fail to catch the real opportunities and potential of machine learning, artificial vision, and big data analytics, just to name a few of the most promising approaches connected to AI. The scope of this paper is to introduce the basic concepts and possible applications of AI to railway academics and practitioners. To that aim, this paper presents a structured taxonomy to guide researchers and practitioners to understand AI techniques, research fields, disciplines, and applications, both in general terms and in close connection with railway applications such as autonomous driving, maintenance, and traffic management. The important aspects of ethics and explainability of AI in railways are also introduced. The connection between AI concepts and railway subdomains has been supported by relevant research addressing existing and planned applications in order to provide some pointers to promising directions.

AB  - English Language-Based Virtual Assistants (ELB-VAs) are AI-powered systems designed to comprehend and respond to user queries in the English language, exemplified by virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa. The need for balancing transparency and user privacy in ELB-VAs is paramount due to their pervasive integration into daily life. Ensuring transparency imbues user trust, while safeguarding privacy addresses ethical concerns associated with personal data. Existing methods involve clear privacy policies, user-controlled data sharing settings, and encryption. However, drawbacks include user confusion and potential biases. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel approach.

AB  - In fields like Ayurvedic medicine, where the quality and purity of leaves have a direct impact on the effectiveness of medicinal formulations, the quality and appropriate sorting of leaves are crucial. Large-scale operations cannot use manual sorting techniques since they are frequently laborintensive, time-consuming, and prone to errors. The Ayurvedic Leaf Classification and Segregation System uses Internet of Things (IoT) technology to provide an automated, effective, and accurate solution to these constraints. Based on their current state of health, the technology automatically classifies and separates Ayurvedic leaves. Real-time photos of leaves are taken by a conveyor belt equipped with a camera. These images are then evaluated and contrasted with an existing dataset that includes information on healthy, afflicted, and non-Ayurvedic leaves. A Raspberry Pi processes and transmits the data for verification, and the system's IoT-based design allows for real-time monitoring and decision-making, greatly reducing manual effort while ensuring higher accuracy. The system's design directs healthy leaves to a dedicated storage area, while non-Ayurvedic and affected leaves are automatically removed and collected in a tray attached to the system stand. The system's efficiency and consistency modernize traditional practices, benefiting the agricultural and Ayurvedic medicine industries.

AB  - Point-cloud data are nowadays one of the major data sources for describing our environment. Recently, deep architectures have been proposed as a key step in understanding and retrieving semantic information. Despite the great contribution of deep learning in this field, the explainability of these models for 3-D data is still fairly unexplored. Explainability, identified as a potential weakness of deep neural networks (DNNs), can help researchers against skepticism, considering that these models are far from being self-explanatory. Although literature provides many examples on the exploitation of explainable artificial intelligence approaches with 2-D data, only a few studies have attempted to investigate it for 3-D DNNs. To overcome these limitations, BubblEX is proposed here, a novel multimodal fusion framework to learn the 3-D point features. BubblEX framework comprises two stages: “Visualization Module” for the visualization of features learned from the network in its hidden layers and “Interpretability Module,” which aims at describing how the neighbor points are involved in the feature extraction. For our experiments, dynamic graph convolutional neural network has been used, trained on Modelnet40 dataset. The developed framework extends a method for obtaining saliency maps from image data, to deal with 3-D point-cloud data, allowing the analysis, comparison, and contrasting of multiple features. Besides, it permits the generation of visual explanations from any DNN-based network for 3-D point-cloud classification without requiring architectural changes or retraining. Our findings will be extremely useful for both scientists and nonexperts in understanding and improving future AI-based models.

AB  - Numerous trucks and container cargo are shifting in port areas, and special attention is required for safety management to prevent accidents. Particularly, in ‘port terminal’, the severity of the accident can be high in terms of human damage. Previous studies attempt to predict and detect port accidents, however, research on deriving major factors influencing port-accident severity and developing accident severity prediction models in port areas are rare. Therefore, to prepare safety management strategies, it is necessary to derive risk factors that affect the accident severity in each port area. This study developed an accident severity model using both statistical and machine learning techniques, including the Multilevel Bayesian logit model, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). In data preparation, oversampling and clustering techniques are applied, which can augment data and separate accident risk situations to any characteristics of port accident data. As a consequence, port-accident severity models are developed with heterogeneous accident data. In this process, a severity model suitable for the characteristics of Korean ports was established by considering the heterogeneity of accident data. After developing the severity model, an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) was used to find key variables affecting port-accident occurrence.

AB  - Credit risk assessment is an essential element of financial stability, impacting banking institutions, governmental financial entities, and individual creditworthiness. This paper presents a machine learning-based credit score model aimed at improving the precision of financial risk evaluations through the use of predictive analytics. The model employs sophisticated algorithms, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks, to categorize individuals into credit risk classifications based on their transaction histories, loan repayment patterns, and income stability. Explainable AI methodologies, such as Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), enhance transparency in decision-making, hence augmenting trust in credit assessments. The research analyzes the effects of economic volatility and regulatory modifications on credit risk evaluation, specifically in Kazakhstan, where there has been a notable increase in consumer loans. Empirical study and thorough experimentation reveal that machine learning models surpass traditional statistical methods, enhancing predicted accuracy and reducing biases in credit assessment. The proposed approach improves financial inclusion by offering a scalable and transparent method for real-time evaluations of creditworthiness. This research advances the creation of adaptable and robust credit risk models that respond to changing financial environments.

AB  - Additive manufacturing (AM), particularly with Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF), excels in fabricating intricate geometries and custom components through layer-by-layer deposition. However, precise control over melt pool geometry is crucial for ensuring high quality and performance. This study uses Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) regression techniques to manage melt pool geometry in AM processes. The primary goal is to evaluate these models' effectiveness in predicting and optimizing melt pool depth, width, and length using extensive datasets of process parameters and material properties. The models produced promising results. The best performance was for melt pool length, with an MSE of 0.0036, RMSE of 0.0600, MAE of 0.0300, and an R-squared score of 0.9456. Integrating these models into Multi-Objective Optimization Using Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) enhances real-time monitoring, control, and optimization of melt pool geometry during production. This approach leverages IoT-enabled capabilities within Industry 4.0 frameworks, improving decision-making and operational efficiency in AM. By providing interpretable AI predictions, this study aims to enhance the quality, reliability, and efficiency of AM processes, contributing to optimized production outcomes in digital manufacturing environments.

AB  - In chemical reactors, motor failures like belt breakage can disrupt production. Traditional methods for detecting motor abnormalities, such as manual inspections and monitoring control room currents, lack effectiveness. This study introduces a T2-LSTM algorithm combined with motor vibration sensors to predict motor quality and establish an early warning system. Statistical Process Control (SPC) techniques determine warning thresholds, while the ISO 10816-1 standard categorizes motor states as Good, Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory, or Unacceptable. Tested with 150 data points in a real-world scenario, the system achieved a 98% prediction accuracy (147/150), with 146 predictions within the normal range and only one unsatisfactory point among the four that exceeded the threshold.

AB  - There is a growing concern about the high degree of non-technical losses (NTL) in developing countries especially sub-saharan Africa. Whereas several studies have employed artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze NTL, a major drawback in these studies is the focus on customer data only without considering the possible contribution of electricity distribution staff to NTL. This study introduces a novel approach to NTL reduction by analyzing a combined dataset of staff operational processes and customer consumption data. A deep-learning architecture called non-technical losses convolutional neural network (NTLCONVNET) was developed which consists of a series of three one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D-CNN) with different depths combined with several fully connected layers. Furthermore, limited or no research has studied the decision rationale influencing how AI models interpret the significance of features in predicting NTL. To achieve the explainability of the model, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) kernel and tree-based explainers were used for the deep and ensemble learning models respectively to determine the relative importance of the variables and how they contribute to the overall model prediction. A novel ranking framework was used to compute the holistic ranking of the variables across multiple models. The finding suggests that the staff-related variables omitted in the extant literature are significant predictors of NTL. The NTLCONVNET was compared with 5 ensemble learning algorithms and the results show that the NTLCONVNET significantly surpasses all other models, scoring 0.844, 0.838, 0.836 and 0.836 on weighted average Precision, Recall, f1 and accuracy respectively. This study suggests a policy outcome of introducing human resource metrics into NTL reduction strategies.

AB  - The ever-increasing need for energy has caused the field of industrial electrical engineering to place a greater emphasis on designs that save energy. This is done with the intention of lowering carbon emissions as well as overall consumption. Transformers, which are essential parts of power supply and distribution systems, may be designed with an energy-efficient layout, which is one of the significant aspects of this phenomenon. This study makes use of Explainable AI (XAI) to investigate power loss in transformers, describe technical factors, determine the number of transformers, and optimize economic functioning using XAI algorithms. In order to attain superior results than those obtained via the use of conventional methods, the energy-saving design approach that was created in this research makes use of IoT sensors and XAI. Experiments that were carried out on a five-star hotel in the province of Jilin revealed a 9.8 and 43.5% decrease in complete power loss for two substations, respectively, when compared to the original design. This resulted in considerable cost reductions in yearly and entire life loss energy expenses. The research provides conclusive evidence that XAI is an efficient tool for generating cost savings and energy efficiency for industrial electrical applications.

AB  - Anomaly detection techniques in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) are driving traditional industries towards an unprecedented level of efficiency, productivity and performance. They are typically developed based on supervised and unsupervised machine learning models. However, some machine learning models are facing “black box” problems, namely the rationale behind the algorithm is not understandable. Recently, several models on explainable anomaly detection have emerged. The “black box” problems have been studied by using such models. But few works focus on applications in the IIoT field, and there is no related review of explainable anomaly detection techniques. In this survey, we provide an overview of explainable anomaly detection techniques in IIoT. We propose a new taxonomy to classify the state-of-the-art explainable anomaly detection techniques into two categories, namely intrinsic based explainable anomaly detection and explainer based explainable anomaly detection. We further discuss the applications of explainable anomaly detection across various IIoT fields. Finally, we suggest future study options in this rapidly expanding subject.

The authors present the architecture over a versatile production system (VPS) corn production plant, where processes are sensor-driven and monitored to minimize bias. The collaboration of DT and xAI leverages the robustness, predictability, and maintainability of VPS processes. In the proposed architecture, the VPS sensor-controlled inputs are sent to the DT controller. The controller is supplied with virtual inputs, which are replicas of real inputs, and the controller behaviour is monitored. The outputs are connected to an xAI module designed with Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) model, which generates the output predictability and dependence on inputs. The unsafe outputs are rejected. A case-study evaluation is carried out in terms of the mean and standard deviation of DT module creation, and SHAP predictability outputs, which shows an accuracy of 96% of unsafe inputs. The proposed results indicate the viability of the framework in real Industry 5.0 VPS setups.

AB  - While AI's accuracy is impressive, it often operates opaquely, leaving users puzzled by its decisions. Explainable AI (XAI) seeks to demystify these processes, yet it encounters usability hurdles, often favouring developers over end-users. This paper introduces EXPERT-DUO, a flexible framework for Explainable Object Classification. While demonstrated in the domain of surgical tool classification, EXPERT-DUO is a versatile system applicable across domains. Operating as an assistant system for the users, the framework accommodates varying levels of domain knowledge and provides understandable decisions through a hierarchical methodology.

AB  - Partial discharges, mainly caused by an insufficient drying processes or different types of contamination, reduce the lifetime of a transformer, and thus lead to expensive rework costs. Herein, a decision support system for partial discharges of transformers occurring in oven and filling processes is introduced. Based on machine learning (ML), partial discharge results are evaluated in dependency of various manufacturing parameters and an automated prediction tool to guide the production with preventive actions is developed. The required data, obtained from sensors and manufacturing sources, is used to train supervised learning algorithms that aim to predict and classify partial discharges. To achieve adequate accuracy and reliability, multiple ML and data mining techniques are applied, including feature engineering, clustering, and final evaluation of performance by cost factors. The evaluation results show that the introduced ML models effectively detect and classify early test failures in oven and filling processes, resulting in a successful identification of key factors and consequently to more efficient action derivation. Overall, the potential of decision support systems as a valuable tool in the field of transformers is emphasized.

AB  - Despite AI transforming algorithmic trading, the lack of transparency in these systems, sometimes referred to as “black boxes,” hinders wider confidence and acceptance. This proposed research presents a novel approach to uncovering the decision-making process of AI-driven trading strategies. It utilizes Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to produce visual explanations that are easy to understand. This methodology surpasses conventional methods of explain ability by transforming the intricate, data-derived understandings of a Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement-learning agent into easily understandable visual representations. More precisely, we utilize saliency maps to emphasize the crucial market elements that affect the agent's actions, offering an unparalleled level of understanding of its operational reasoning. Our assessment highlights the effectiveness of these visualizations in improving human comprehension, thus closing the gap between advanced AI capabilities and practical financial experience. This work not only promotes increased clarity and trust in algorithmic trading but also establishes a standard for using visual explanations in intricate AI systems. This has ramifications for adhering to regulations, creating algorithms, and involving stakeholders in the financial sector.

AB  - Agriculturalists can greatly benefit from techniques that forecast the kinds of illnesses that plants will encounter during their lives. This article provides information on these methods through a thorough survey that included a range of image-based plant leaf diseases. These illnesses often cause great harm and can affect any section of the plant. These illnesses cause enormous cumulative losses that lower output and raise financial losses in agriculture. The agriculture sector must persevere through these challenges and grow as a result to be very lucrative. This study examined the diagnosis of plant diseases using machine learning algorithms and general image processing methods that may be applied at various stages of a plant's life cycle. Numerous techniques based on automation or computer vision concepts are currently in place for identifying plant diseases. However, they lack precision and are hard to interpret. Furthermore, no single method can detect all conditions. For cultivation to be effective, the plant's status must be monitored at every growth stage.

AB  - Machine Learning (ML) models are increasingly applied to Learning Management System (LMS) data to predict student engagement and performance. LMS data often contain missing values that can be informative. However, existing modeling approaches in education remove or impute missing values, which can lead to inaccurate or biased models. In this paper, we propose the use of digital twins to model students’ engagement based on their learning activities on LMS while preserving the missingness patterns. We leveraged synthetic data generators such as Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network (CTGAN), Tabular Variational Autoencoder (TVAE), and RealTabFormer with reversible data transformations to create a virtual replica of students’ data. The CTGAN and TVAE generated balanced synthetic data that accurately captured the meaningful patterns of the real data. Moreover, XGBoost trained on a balanced virtual replica of the students’ learning activities data obtained an F1-score of above 80% in predicting the students’ engagement levels when evaluated on real data with both complete and incomplete entries. Our findings demonstrate how digital twins can be used to address the complexities of data in the education sector, improve the generalization of models, and reduce bias in real-world performance.

AB  - The boom of research topics such as AI literacy and explainable AI (XAI) intensified political discussions about the right for meaningful explanations of the logic involved leave no doubt about the necessity of AI education. However, technologies that we find in our every lives often hide architectural aspects to make their benefits accessible for everyone. Additionally, performance seems to trade-off for explainability, leading to a black-box system not understandable for users and sometimes even experts. To address this issue this paper introduces a workshop framework designed to enhance interactions with large language models (LLMs) - in particular ChatGPT. With emphasis on observation, analysis and hands-on interaction, the workshop framework pursues three different goals: (1) as an event for scientific research, (2) as a learning event and (3) as science communication work to integrate the public more closely into research. Pre-post-test data suggests a shift in participants' interaction patterns when using ChatGPT. Participants not only questioned the AI's responses but also reflected on their own understanding, asking follow-up questions or offering suggestions on how to better explain concepts to the AI.

AB  - Energy consumption at the various steps of the Machine Learning (ML) model life cycle, as a constituent application of Artificial Intelligence (AI), is infrequently reported. While the Explainable AI (XAI) or Explainable ML (XML) movement has focused upon more explainable ML models, the AI Energy Consumption (AEC) facet has not progressed as rapidly and still remains quite translucent. For example, even the AEC ratios of the key AI stages (e.g., pre-training, fine-tuning, and inferencing) have not always accompanied the releases of new ML models. This lack of data has, perhaps, contributed to the dearth of analyses on effective compute (e.g., algorithmic efficiency versus hardware efficiency) for the newer models, and in modern times, AEC may be skewing to the inferencing side. This may necessitate revised architectures, particularly amidst the findings that generalized ML models for specific tasks have a much higher AEC when contrasted against task-specific ML models. It has also been reported that, within those same models, a higher number of parameters segues to a higher AEC. Higher accuracies also beget higher AECs, and “advanced anomaly detection” necessitates tasks that have an even higher AEC. Moreover, as it is now customary to run numerous instances of a pre-trained model over various instances in an ensemble fashion, the AEC is multiplied accordingly. Yet, there are opportunities to reduce AEC at the Metaheuristic Algorithm (MA) level (e.g., at the convolutional layer), and certain versatile constructs (that scale well across the AI stages) are amenable to such optimizations; furthermore, performance metric comparisons in the literature have, traditionally, been artificially constrained to a “fixed number of allowed function calls,” and this might have led to misinterpretations of MA performance in Real World Scenario (RWS) paradigms. These misinterpretations can skew research directions, particularly for RWS Multiple Objective Large Scale Nonlinear Programming Problems (MOLSNLP) and may also lead to an underestimation of the involved AEC. This paper presents a promising RWS-oriented Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based MA with concomitant Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) AECs.

AB  - The development of diseases in plants can significantly affect production in agriculture. Deep Learning in recent years has proved to be a promising technique to develop an automatic system for disease diagnosis in plants. The current manuscript focuses on how fine-tuning the state-of-the-art convolution neural network models can be performed for image-based plant disease diagnosis. The models fine-tuned involve VGG-16, Inception V3, ResNet 50, ResNet 101, ResNet 152, MobileNet, NasNet Mobile, and DenseNet 121. In our experiments, both fine-tuned VGG-16 and ResNet-50 were able to classify the diseases more unambiguously than the other models in the case of the PlantVillage dataset. The VGG-16 and ResNet 50 models obtained a test accuracy score of 97.18% and 97.90% respectively. The Inception v3 and the MobileNet models performed best on the maize leaf dataset with a test score of 92.28% and 92.62% respectively. This manuscript can help the researchers get a brief idea about how a model pre-trained can be fine-tuned for a particular task, how it can help reduce training time, show improved performance, avoid overfitting, provide transfer of knowledge, and how explainable artificial intelligence can be used to increase the explainability and the interpretability of the models.

AB  - The carbon dioxide (CO2) fertilization effect has captured worldwide attention, owing to its tremendous potential to challenge existing predictions of future climate. However, quantifying the CO2 fertilization effect (CFE) has proven to be challenging, given that it is closely entangled with other ecological and environmental processes. Recent years have witnessed significant advances with breakthroughs using theoretical methods to infer the CFE from eddy covariance tower measurements. Building on earlier findings, this study presents an innovative approach that utilizes explainable machine-learning techniques—describing the partial dependence of the response variable to each explanatory variable—to quantify the global CFE from remote-sensing platforms with an averaged  $R ^{2}$  of 0.85. This study provides the first data-driven evidence of the global CFE and confirms the potential for extrapolation to the globe. The findings suggest that: 1) the employment of satellite vegetation proxies contributed to more than 50% of the fitting of gross primary productivity (GPP) and 2) the manifestation of the CO2 fertilization impact demonstrated heterogeneity among various types of ecosystems, and in some cases, an adverse effect was detected in broadleaf forests. Our results have significant implications for the preservation and protection of terrestrial ecosystems, particularly for a carbon-neutral future. This study, therefore, provides a valuable contribution to the growing body of knowledge in this area and highlights the potential of innovative analytical techniques to address complex ecological challenges.

In this article, we point out the gap in automated performance monitoring and prediction as a factor preventing the design of autonomous mobile network management systems. In addition, we systematize the basics of modeling KPIs measured in a mobile network and conditioned by their configuration and environmental states. KPI modeling recommendations summarized for different network levels were demonstrated for two applications using datasets collected from operator networks, that is, quantifying the performance change in a population of 350 5G cells with unique configuration settings updates, and predicting the performance profile for an unknown configuration in a model trained with historical data associated with different configurations applied to a population of network cells.

AB  - Telematics devices have transformed driver risk assessment, allowing insurers to tailor premiums based on detailed evaluations of driving habits. However, integrating Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and contextualized geolocation data for predictive improvements remains underexplored due to the recent emergence of these technologies. This article introduces a novel risk assessment methodology that periodically computes weekly insurance premiums by incorporating ADAS risk indicators and contextualized geolocation data. Using a naturalistic dataset from a fleet of 354 commercial drivers over a year, we modeled the relationship between past claims and driving data, and use that to compute weekly premiums that penalize risky driving situations. Risk predictions are modeled through claims frequency using Poisson regression and claims occurrence probability using machine learning models, including XGBoost and TabNet, and interpreted with SHAP. The dataset is divided into weekly profiles containing aggregated driving behavior, ADAS events, and contextual attributes. Results indicate that both modeling approaches show consistent attribute impacts on driver risk. For claims occurrence probability, XGBoost achieved the lowest Log Loss, reducing it from 0.59 to 0.51 with the inclusion of all attributes; for claims frequency, no statistically significant differences were observed when including all attributes. However, adding ADAS and contextual attributes allows for a comprehensive and disaggregated interpretation of the resulting weekly premium. This dynamic pricing can be incorporated into the insurance lifecycle, enabling bespoke risk assessment based on emerging technologies, the driving context, and driver behavior.

AB  - Financial risk management is increasingly focusing on credit risk analysis. The difficulty in this situation is to find insights into the performance of the finance sector using machine learning algorithms because those insights have a direct impact on the sector’s viability. For the evaluation of the credit risk of the customer dataset, numerous credit risk analysis techniques are employed. In particular, using private datasets, we suggest a novel classification methodology for ML-driven credit risk algorithms and their performance ranking. In order to predict the likelihood of a loan default, we create binary classifiers based on machine learning models using actual data. The 10 most relevant features from each of these models are chosen after conducting a performance analysis on the given data set. These features are then utilized in the modeling process to ensure that binary classifiers are stable.

AB  - In recent years, deep learning has entailed great progresses, but this success is seen as a triumph of empiricism. Despite the efforts made in the understanding of the deep models, the gap between the theoretical interpretability and the empirical success of deep models is still large. At present, the interpretability analysis of deep learning is mostly done after the training process. In this work, a novel method is proposed to extract interpretable features during the training process. Particularly, a modified Siamese network is used to disentangle features using a specially designed loss function. After a feature extractor, a fully connected layer is used to divide the output of the Siamese network into four different parts from which the new loss function is designed. The feature extractor used in the Siamese network may be different types of CNN. It is found that the proposed method can effectively disentangle the features at the semantic level, and the disentangled features can be used to effectively improve the classification accuracy in occluded face recognition.

AB  - Managing risks in Agile IT projects particularly for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), is a complex challenge due to the iterative and dynamic nature of Agile methodologies. Conventional risk management frameworks frequently prove inadequate for these complexities, resulting in possible delays, budget excesses, and diminished quality. In this paper, we present a Risk Prioritization and Mitigation System as a solution that utilizes Artificial Intelligence to automate the risk detection, prioritization, and mitigation processes in Agile workflows. Employing machine-learning algorithms like XGBoost classifiers and data preprocessing methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, ARPMS classifies the data into the required risk levels (low, medium, and high risk) with almost 100% accuracy. The system aims to interface with Agile tools, providing real-time risk alerts and actionable insights via an interactive dashboard. Testing performed on an incident log and credit risk data sets proved ARPMS's capability to mitigate risk impact, enhance decision-making, and optimize project results. Future improvements include scaling the datasets, adding real-time data streams, and further investigation for adaptive prioritization. ARPMS integrates predictive analytics with Agile principles, providing a scalable and robust risk management approach that enables teams to proactively enhance project resilience.

AB  - Improving agriculture productivity of plants and animals relies on early and accurate identification of diverse diseases. However, traditional methods used for diagnosing diseases sustained through physical checking are largely inefficient, prone to human-made errors, and quite tedious. Thankfully, rapid advancements in AI and deep learning have provided automated, precise, and real time disease identification solutions. This paper examines the deep learning approach to plant and animal disease diagnosis. In particular, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based model is established which classifies and diagnoses diseases utilizing multiple datasets containing images on plant leaves and other animal health indicators. Performance of the model is further improved through advanced image preprocessing techniques like augmentation and feature extraction. From the experimental results, it was noted that this system is significantly more accurate than traditional approaches. This research marks the intersection between AI and agriculture and veterinary medicine, accentuating the possibility of fundamentals of precision agriculture and veterinary medicine AI tools to enable timely disease identification and mitigate economic loss. Later research would include building IoT sensors for real time surveillance and monitoring to make predictions.

The research examines performance outcomes of five algorithms which consist of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Random Forest together with XGBoost proved as the most accurate machine learning models when used for cardiovascular risk assessment. The researchers built a hybrid structure of CNN and SVM because it improved both data classification and feature extraction processes for better prediction outcomes. The training and evaluation process of models encountered difficulties because of overfitting along with high computational expenses and problems regarding optimal hyperparameter settings. The research stresses that explainable AI (XAI) methods should integrate into systems to enhance model interpretability and achieve trust from clinical professionals. Future initiatives seek real-time patient monitoring and innovative interpretability systems for heart attack prediction to enable person-specific diagnoses and optimal clinical choices in medical fields.

AB  - Modern healthcare is increasingly relying on Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) systems, which continuously collect health data and provide the ability to monitor patients in real-time. RPM systems are extremely susceptible to cyber threats due to their growing reliance on interconnected devices and hence need comprehensive security. AI has emerged as a crucial technology for addressing security issues in RPM systems. The objective of this survey is to understand the impact on the security of RPM systems by integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) with threat intelligence. This survey analyzed 86 research articles from leading databases related to AI models, security of RPM systems, anomaly detection, and architectural solutions, in addition to 24 articles related to existing RPMs. This survey article emphasizes that RPM systems become much more resilient when automated attack mitigation, real-time anomaly detection, and predictive analytics are provided by AI-powered models. To secure the sensitive data in RPM, this survey discusses how AI can be applied to various architectural solutions, including edge computing, cloud integration, blockchain technology, and Federated Learning (FL). Furthermore, the benefits and challenges of deploying AI-driven threat intelligence, cross-platform compatibility, and the need for explainable AI to improve trust in automatically made decisions are presented. Moreover, this review highlights research gaps, including the necessity of comprehensive end-to-end architectures for maintaining security and privacy in RPM systems. It is revealed through this survey that AI-powered threat intelligence enhances RPM security considerably due to its ability of continuous monitoring, adaptive defense mechanisms, and early detection of threats. However, challenges such as the explainability of AI models persist and necessitate continued innovation. The survey paper suggests integrating AI-enhanced threat Detection as a Service (TDaas) that implements FL to transform the existing RPM security system, and ultimately contributes to a secure and reliable threat detection system in healthcare. This review provides a roadmap for future research in the area of AI-driven threat intelligence security for RPM systems and offers insights for developing resilient healthcare infrastructure.

AB  - Requirements classification is a traditional application of machine learning (ML) to RE that helps handle large requirements datasets. A prime example of an RE classification problem is the distinction between functional and non-functional (quality) requirements. State-of-the-art classifiers build their effectiveness on a large set of word features like text n-grams or POS n-grams, which do not fully capture the essence of a requirement. As a result, it is arduous for human analysts to interpret the classification results by exploring the classifier's inner workings. We propose the use of more general linguistic features, such as dependency types, for the construction of interpretable ML classifiers for RE. Through a feature engineering effort, in which we are assisted by modern introspection tools that reveal the hidden inner workings of ML classifiers, we derive a set of 17 linguistic features. While classifiers that use our proposed features fit the training set slightly worse than those that use high-dimensional feature sets, our approach performs generally better on validation datasets and it is more interpretable.

AB  - Optimizing ICPS attack detection deep learning models is still a challenging undertaking that calls for precise a hyperparameter adjustment. The proliferation of cyber threats necessitates robust intrusion detection technologies to fortify industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPS). The XIDS structure, developed for use in ICPS, is an improved intrusion detection system that employs Bayesian optimization methods to fine-tune the deep-learning parameters, ensemble-based filter feature selection techniques (EFFS), and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Combining AI that is explicable with the XAI-EKHO-FS technique, the proposed model aims to discover which attributes are critical for intrusion detection. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) could potentially utilize when investigating the ways in which different variables impact the outcomes and comprehension that are anticipated. Making intrusion detection more visible, comprehensible, and flexible is just one additional way this technology improves industrial IT safety. Also, this research recommends a hybrid deep learning technique called BO-GRULSTM for precise intrusion categorization as a way to improve the performance of intrusion detection systems (IDS). To fine-tune the GRU-LSTM networks’ extremes variables, the Bayesian optimising method was used. The proposed BO-GRU-LSTM method achieves an outstanding $99.42 \%$ accuracy, surpassing GRU, LSTM, and BILSTM. Comparing this to the more antiquated GRU, LSTM, and BI-LSTM algorithms is like looking at a mountain.

AB  - Recent years have witnessed the Open Radio Access Network (RAN) paradigm transforming the fundamental ways cellular systems are deployed, managed, and optimized. This shift is led by concepts such as openness, softwarization, programmability, interoperability, and intelligence of the network, which have emerged in wired networks through Software-defined Networking (SDN) but lag behind in cellular systems. The realization of the Open RAN vision into practical architectures, intelligent data-driven control loops, and efficient software implementations, however, is a multifaceted challenge, which requires (i) datasets to train Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) models; (ii) facilities to test models without disrupting production networks; (iii) continuous and automated validation of the RAN software; and (iv) significant testing and integration efforts. This paper is a tutorial on how Colosseum—the world’s largest wireless network emulator with hardware in the loop—can provide the research infrastructure and tools to fill the gap between the Open RAN vision, and the deployment and commercialization of open and programmable networks. We describe how Colosseum implements an Open RAN digital twin through a high-fidelity Radio Frequency (RF) channel emulator and endto- end softwarized O-RAN and 5G-compliant protocol stacks, thus allowing users to reproduce and experiment upon topologies representative of real-world cellular deployments. Then, we detail the twinning infrastructure of Colosseum, as well as the automation pipelines for RF and protocol stack twinning. Finally, we showcase a broad range of Open RAN use cases implemented on Colosseum, including the real-time connection between the digital twin and real-world networks, and the development, prototyping, and testing of AI/ML solutions for Open RAN.

AB  - The efficacy of fatigue life approximation methodologies for Landing Gear systems is studied and compared to the ongoing Structural Health Monitoring techniques being researched, which will forecast failures based on the system’s specific life and withstanding abilities, ranging from creating a digital simulation model to applying neural network technologies, in order to simulate and approximate locations and levels of failure along the structure. Explainable Artificial Intelligence allows for the ease-of-integration of Deep Neural Network data into Predictive Maintenance, which is a procedure focused on the health of a system and its efficient upkeep via the use of sensor-based data. Test data from a flight includes a multitude of conditions and varying parameters such as the surface of the landing strip as well as the aircraft itself, requiring the use of Deep Neural Network models for damage assessment and failure anticipation, where compliance to standards is a major question raised, as the EASA AI roadmap is followed, as well as the ICAO and FAA. This paper additionally discusses the challenges faced with respect to standardizing the Explainable AI methodologies and their parameters specifically for the case of Landing Gear.

AB  - Plant diseases pose a significant threat to global food security by limiting access to safe and abundant food sources while impacting agricultural productivity and food safety. To address this challenge, innovative disease detection techniques are crucial. This paper presents a novel approach to tomato leaf disease detection grounded in deep transfer learning. We employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to recognize and categorize diseases, leveraging pre-trained models such as EfficientNetB3, Xception, and MobileNetV2. Our experimental results highlight the efficacy of these models, with the CNN achieving an accuracy of 0.92, MobileNetV2 at 0.93, Xception at 0.94 and EfficientNetB3 at 0.993. By combining these machine learning techniques with image processing methods, we create a system capable of diagnosing tomato leaf diseases promptly. The system employs image processing techniques to facilitate disease recognition, enabling automated disease identification as soon as symptoms manifest on leaves or plants. This empowers farmers with timely information and appropriate treatment options, ultimately leading to precise disease management. Furthermore, our research delves into model interpretability by employing Saliency maps and Grad-CAM techniques, providing valuable insights into the decision-making process of our deep learning models. This transparency enhances the trustworthiness of the AI-driven disease detection system, fostering its practical application in agriculture.

AB  - With the rapid expansion of global networks and the proliferation of IoT devices, the complexity and scale of traffic have grown exponentially. This surge in connectivity demands larger, faster, and more serviceable architectures, like Software Defined Networks (SDNs). Motivated by various interests, malicious agents seek to compromise services within the network with different attacks. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are solutions often implemented in SDN using Deep Learning algorithms. These methods are more challenging to explain as they grow in complexity and become less trustworthy for handling sensitive issues like cyber security. This work uses SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to explain a consolidated IDS that combines Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) with Generative Adversarial Network’s discriminator. We conducted a feature selection based on the SHAP explanation and used its insights to better tune the time series’s window size hyperparameter. The optimized model performed similarly to the original, with a margin for improvement upon further hyperparameter tuning. It was also more stable in the training phase and faster to execute. This new version of the model was also explained by SHAP and presented a more consistent behavior.

AB  - The Artificial Intelligence Act was adopted in the European Parliament in March 2024 to establish a uniform legal framework for the development and uptake of human-centric and trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) in Europe. Considering that AI may generate risks and cause harm, the approach for evaluating the newly developed AI and decision support systems (DSS) will vary from domain to domain. This paper presents the approach the European Union (EU) funded project IntelliLung is currently implementing in the healthcare domain. The IEC 62559-2:2015 methodology was used to structure the IntelliLung AI-DSS requirements and define key performance indicators relevant for the functional parts of the system (data integration, pre-processing, AI modelling). "Ethics-by-design" and "Transparent AI design" methodologies have been used for the IntelliLung AI-DSS implementation. The compliance requirements analysis has shown that the trustworthiness of AI-DSS relies on a wide set of measures including information and communication security, explainable AI algorithms, data governance and privacy considerations, as well as risk-management throughout the entire lifecycle of AI-DSS as a high-risk AI system.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have become prevalent across various industries, steering to diverse and far-reaching outcomes, and their convergence has garnered significant attention in the tech world. Studies and reviews are instrumental in supplying industries with the nuanced understanding of the multifaceted developments of this joint domain. This paper undertakes a critical examination of existing perspectives and governance policies, adopting a contextual approach, and addressing not only the potential but also the limitations of these governance policies. In the complex landscape of AI-infused IoT systems, transparency and interpretability are pivotal qualities for informed decision-making and effective governance. In AI governance, transparency allows for scrutiny and accountability, while interpretability facilitates trust and confidence in AI-driven decisions. Therefore, we also evaluate and advocate for the use of two very popular eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques-SHAP and LIME-in explaining the predictive results of AI models. Subsequently, this paper underscores the imperative of not only maximizing the advantages and services derived from the incorporation of IoT and AI but also diligently minimizing possible risks and challenges.

By integrating knowledge graphs, ontologies, and deep neural networks, the approach harmonizes human expertise and machine learning to predict, diagnose, and mitigate defects in real time. Focusing on Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and other expert sources, the research transforms this knowledge into structured physics-aware ontologies and knowledge graphs to enable seamless integration with neural networks. Additionally, novel ensemble neural network architectures are explored to leverage the full potential of physics-aware neurosymbolic techniques. The proposed framework enhances defect prediction and root cause analysis and also paves the way for more interpretable and adaptive AI-driven quality control systems in semiconductor manufacturing.

AB  - In the area of machine learning (ML) training data optimization through the construction of compact data, the focus of this paper is presented. The concept of compact data design, aimed at creating an optimized dataset that maximizes benefits without the need to manage a vast amount of complex data, is introduced. Improvements in the methods for optimizing ML training have been incorporated into the development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. The introduction of understanding ML training datasets as a facet of Explainable AI (XAI), comprehensible to humans, has been made. Among the methods of XAI, the evaluation of input feature importance stands out as a way to enhance the accuracy of complex ML models. The innovative method of compact data design for optimizing ML training through dataset reduction is proposed. The performance of an ML-based malware detection system, along with its variant utilizing compact data, has been assessed, demonstrating the maintenance of 99% accuracy. By applying a 76% reduced input dataset, the speed of ML training with the novel compact data design could be maximized, suggesting that an ML system trained in this manner could achieve statistically equivalent accuracy with only 57% of the original data sample size.

AB  - In this paper, a wide-ranging appraisal has been made for using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in economic power dispatch of smart grids. One of essential functions is economic dispatch (ED) in power systems, which assigns the optimal generation resources to meet demand with minimum operational cost. The modern power systems exhibit a non-linear, non-convex feature making the traditional optimization methods insufficient to cope up with progress in smart grid technology and transition of conventional energy resources towards renewable. These challenges can be dealt with effectively by AI-based methods. The review covers artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic systems and evolutionary algorithms as well as hybrid possibilities. Then, it compares these methods considering the effectiveness and computational efficiency in managing uncertainty of a smart grid. In addition, it discusses the implementation of these methods in addressing smart grid-level challenges related to renewable energy integration and demand response. Discussion: It concludes by presenting the common challenges and future issues in this area as well as recent trends of AI (deep reinforcement learning) due to a potential advent of new class tools using Explainable AI.

AB  - It is a very popular era for machine learning (ML) applications, and Industry5.0 aims to have AI as one of its key technologies. Still, only a few ML initiatives make it to a production-grade implementation, mostly due to lacking proper Continuous Integration and Delivery framework and MLOps practices. This is especially true for industrial use cases, where the trust and reliability of ML applications are mission-critical. Most of these applications fail during the final stage of the development lifecycle, i.e. acceptance testing and validation of the ML application, while being integrated into Cyber-Physical System of Systems (CPSoS). This paper explores the key requirements for deploying ML applications in industrial scenarios, emphasizing the critical role of Digital Twins, edge AI, and responsible-explainable AI techniques in ensuring efficient and responsible operations. Building upon previous models, this paper suggests two process models: (i) the Olympics model for MLOps-coupled CPS engineering and (ii) the MLOps engineering toolchain for industrial applications.

AB  - Dark patterns are deceptive user interface designs for online services that make users behave in unintended ways. Dark patterns, such as privacy invasion, financial loss, and emotional distress, can harm users. These issues have been the subject of considerable debate in recent years. In this paper, we study interpretable dark pattern auto-detection, that is, why a particular user interface is detected as having dark patterns. First, we trained a model using transformer-based pre-trained language models, BERT, on a text-based dataset for the automatic detection of dark patterns in e-commerce. Then, we applied post-hoc explanation techniques, including local interpretable model agnostic explanation (LIME) and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP), to the trained model, which revealed which terms influence each prediction as a dark pattern. In addition, we extracted and analyzed terms that affected the dark patterns. Our findings may prevent users from being manipulated by dark patterns, and aid in the construction of more equitable internet services.

AB  - The rapid growth in digitalization has increased the number of cyber threats. This has challenged the traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), which depend on static rules and predefined signatures. Among the various methods available for detection, the Reinforcement Learning (RL) method is an adaptive approach that guarantees intrusion detection. Still, some of its limitations and the black-box nature weaken the trust and clearness in security-critical ecosystems. In this paper, we analyzed the need for artificial intelligence (AI) integration with intrusion detection by enabling Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with an integration of RL to create an efficient and interoperable intrusion detection framework. The result is to leverage GNNs to depict complex relationships in network traffic and apply explainable AI to improve the transparency of RL models. We also analyze the issues related to key performance parameters such as scalability and model interoperability and provide the scope for future research.

AB  - This paper contributes to interpretable machine learning via visual knowledge discovery in general line coordinates (GLC). The concepts of hyperblocks as interpretable dataset units and general line coordinates are combined to create a visual self-service machine learning model. Dynamic Scaffolding Coordinates as lossless multidimensional coordinate systems are proposed, and their applications as visual models is shown. DSC1 and DSC2 can map multiple dataset attributes to a single two-dimensional (X, Y) Cartesian plane using a graph construction algorithm. The hyperblock analysis was used to determine visually appealing dataset attribute orders and to reduce line occlusion. It is shown that hyperblocks can generalize decision tree rules and a series of DSC1 or DSC2 plots can visualize a decision tree. The DSC1 and DSC2 plots were tested on benchmark datasets from the UCI ML repository. They allowed for visual classification of data. Additionally, areas of hyperblock impurity were discovered and used to establish dataset splits that highlight the upper estimate of worst-case model accuracy to guide model selection for high-risk decision-making. Major benefits of DSC1 and DSC2 is their highly interpretable nature. They allow domain experts to control or establish new machine learning models through visual pattern discovery.

AB  - Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) play a crucial role in supporting the global economy by contributing significantly to employment and value creation. Therefore, accurately predicting early signs of financial distress in SMEs and taking timely management improvement actions is of paramount importance. However, there is a lack of research on developing multi-class financial distress prediction (MFDP) models specifically for SMEs. Moreover, traditional MFDP models often lack interpretability. To address this, this study proposes definitions for multi-class financial distress in SMEs and constructs a MFDP model using machine learning. Additionally, it introduces an explainable framework to interpret the constructed model. Specifically, the study classifies SMEs' financial conditions into three categories: healthy, mild financial distress, and severe financial distress. It conducts a comparative analysis of six machine learning models. Furthermore, it proposes new interpretation methods for the MFDP model using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and counterfactual explanations (CE), both of which are explainable artificial intelligence techniques. The empirical results reveal that the MFDP model, which adjusts data balance using random oversampling and integrates LightGBM with a one-versus-rest decomposition method, demonstrates the highest performance. Moreover, the proposed explainable framework demonstrates that it can provide practical and concrete improvement strategies to the model users, such as managers and financial institutions.

We formulate our framework within the context of reinforcement learning to pave the way for safety-aware agents. Nevertheless, we assert that our approach could prove beneficial in various contexts, including a safety alert system or analytical purposes. A comprehensive examination of our framework is conducted using a realistic autonomous driving simulator, illustrating its high sample efficiency and reliable prediction capabilities for previously unseen collision events.

AB  - Clustering is one of the most popular unsupervised learning techniques in machine learning. It is used to recognize hidden patterns in data and group them accordingly. Data can be categorized using different clustering algorithms. However, there is no specific clustering algorithm that can be certified as the best in all cases. It is a matter of study which algorithm suits the best for a particular dataset. However, in contrast to the current literature, no study has been found to perform a cluster analysis based on a flood dataset, which has a significant impact on flood risk management. In this study, we have compared 10 clustering algorithms: k-means, bisecting k-means, fuzzy c-means, Gaussian mixture model (GMM), agglomerative, BIRCH, spectral, DBSCAN, OPTICS and mean shift according to 5 evaluation metrics: Rand index, silhouette score, Fowlkes-Mallows index, Davies-Bouldin index and Calinski-Harabasz index by applying them to a flood dataset in order to categorize data to identify flood. Moreover, optimal features from the flood dataset were selected based on random forest algorithm. The k-means is the best method for the dataset because it showed the best performance according to three of the five assessment measures. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to include the SHAP value analysis along with the means to interpret the results.

AB  - Vehicle category classification is an integral part of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). In this context, vision-based approaches are of increasing interest due to recent progress in camera hardware and machine learning algorithms. Currently, for vision-based classification an end-to-end approach based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is the state-of-the-art. However, their inherent black-box approach and the difficulty of modifying existing or adding new categories currently limit their application in ITS. Here, we present an alternative classification approach that partially removes these limitations. It consists of three parts: 1) a CNN-based detector for semantically strong vehicle parts provides the basis for 2) a feature construction step, followed by 3) the final classification based on a decision tree. Ultimately this approach will allow to keep the training-intensive part-detector fixed, once a sufficiently large set of vehicle parts has been trained. Modification of existing categories and addition of new ones are possible by changes to the feature construction and classification steps only. We illustrate the effectiveness of this approach through the extension of the vehicle classifier from 11 to 16 categories by adding an “articulate” feature. In addition, the vehicle parts provide clear interpretability and the conceptually simple feature construction and decision tree classifier provide explainability of the approach. Nevertheless, the part-based classifier achieves comparable accuracy to an end-to-end CNN model trained on all 16 classes.

AB  - Every year, maritime accidents cause severe damages not only to humans but also to maritime instruments like vessels. The authors of this work therefore propose a machine learning-based maritime accident prediction system that can be used to prevent maritime accidents from happening by predicting and interpreting the accidents. This work overcomes the limitations of the existing works that lack practicability in the sense that the ex-post analyses are conducted to suggest accident prevention strategies but maritime accidents are not analyzed holistically. Using extensive literature reviews and expert interviews, a large number of risk factors associated with maritime accidents are identified, and related data are collected and utilized in the work. Throughout variable selection, data retrieval, hot-spot identification, and the maritime accident prediction model construction process, various machine learning algorithms are exploited in order to construct an organized system. In addition, interpretations for the resulting accident predictions are given using interpretable machine learning algorithms so as to provide explainable results to users. Finally, the proposed system is evaluated using a SERVQUAL model and proves its effectiveness in real-world applications.

AB  - This research thoroughly investigates the impact of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence(AI) on employee work performance as well as job contentment. Six distinct algorithms were evaluated: Random Forests, XGBoost, AdaBoost, Support Vector Regression(SVR), Decision Trees, and Linear Regression for predicting staff satisfaction and efficiency based on factors such as department, experience level, access to training, and other variables. The investigation employs data preprocessing techniques, like StandardScaler, to ensure each feature contributes equally to the analysis, and uses train-test splitting to separate information for training and evaluating models. Among the algorithms tested, SVR emerged as the top performing model, displaying superior precision in anticipating worker outcomes. SHAP values are used to point the components that significantly affect the model's forecasts of productivity and satisfaction. Some employees thrive in roles that continuously introduce them to new problems, whereas others prefer tasks that do not frequently change. This methodology offers an inter-pretable and accurate way to identify and evaluate most relevant factors of employee outcomes. With the power of these cutting-edge ML methods, organisations can delve deeper into analyzing their employees' performance. This data-driven approach will result in better work environment, focused training programs and finally a happy working force. The study reiterates the promise of AI-ML in addressing intricate workplace nuances to drive strategic workforce policy changes meant to boost employee happiness, and organisational efficiency.

AB  - The construction industry is responsible for a substantial portion of final energy consumption (36%) and carbon dioxide emissions (39%), and this share is likely to rise as urbanization increases. This paper presents this model, which is based on HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems. Utilizing reinforcement learning (RL), one can ascertain the most efficient strategy to reduce HVAC energy usage while ensuring the thermal comfort of inhabitants. Because neural networks are complex and unpredictable, which impede the broad acceptance of artificial intelligence in the power industry. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is used to explain the decision-making process in deep reinforcement learning, HVAC systems are major energy users in buildings, and the switch to mixed ventilation modes has resulted in a more than 40% decrease in cooling device energy usage when compared to traditional methods. The energy transfer dynamics within HVAC systems can be delineated as a Markov Decision Process, with the objective of making informed choices across various states to maximize long-term benefits. The exploration of agents’ behavioral policies can be enabled through the utilization of the Multi Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm (MADDPG). Experimental findings indicate that the RL-driven HVAC energy management approach is adept at adapting to diverse environmental conditions, effectively curbing energy usage, and enhancing comfort levels compared to conventional optimization control strategies.

AB  - Obesity, a major global health concern, is linked to several life-threatening conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer. Early detection of obesity is crucial for effective intervention and prevention strategies. In this study, we investigate the performance of advanced machine learning techniques, specifically gradient boosting models-XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost-for predicting obesity risk levels using medical, demographic, and lifestyle data. Rigorous preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation were employed to ensure robust model development. XGBoost emerged as the most accurate model with an outstanding validation accuracy of 91.67%, followed by LightGBM and CatBoost. Despite minor overfitting in LightGBM, all three models demonstrated exceptional generalization capabilities. The findings highlight the potential of gradient boosting models for enhancing early obesity detection and personalized risk management in healthcare settings. Future work could focus on expanding the dataset, integrating explainable AI for better model interpretation, and exploring hybrid or deep learning models to further improve predictive performance. These results provide a solid foundation for implementing machine learning-based systems in public health programs aimed at combating the obesity epidemic.

AB  - As deep learning has been successfully deployed in diverse applications, there is an ever increasing need to explain its decision. To explain decisions, case-based reasoning has proved to be effective in many areas. The prototype-based explanation is a method that provides an explanation of the model’s prediction using the distance between an input and learned prototypes to effectively perform case-based reasoning. However, existing methods are less reliable because distance is not always consistent with human perception. In this study, we construct a latent space which we call an  $explanation space$  with distributional embedding and latent space regularization. This explanation space ensures that similar (in terms of human-interpretable features) images share similar latent representations, and therefore provides a reliable explanation for the consistency between distance-based explanation and human perception. The explanation space also provides additional explanation by transition, allowing the user to understand the factors that affect the distance. Throughout extensive experiments including human evaluation, we have shown that the explanation space provides a more human-understandable explanation.

AB  - QSync-Twin6G, a novel algorithmic paradigm, is proposed to address the emerging challenges in synchronizing autonomous vehicular ecosystems via quantum-assisted digital twin frameworks over 6G-enabled edge environments. This work conceptualizes and implements a hybrid quantum-twin model, where quantum entanglement principles are leveraged to achieve ultraprecise, low-latency synchronization across distributed vehicular digital replicas. QSync-Twin6G operates through a dual-layer synergy—Quantum State Propagation Module (QSPM) and Edge Twin Synchronization Engine (ETSE)— which collectively orchestrate entangled state coherence and seamless data state transition across vehicular nodes. The entanglement-assisted twin fidelity modeling ensures that vehicular events in physical space are instantaneously mirrored within their digital counterparts, minimizing update drift and eliminating the propagation lags inherent in classical digital twin approaches. Extensive simulations utilizing vehicular trace datasets and QuNetSim quantum communication modules validate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of synchronization precision, convergence rapidity, and energy-latency balance when benchmarked against existing AI-based and edge-driven synchronization frameworks. Performance indicators illustrate up to 81% reduction in update drift, 73% enhancement in convergence speed, and 62% energy savings across diverse vehicular scenarios. The proposed architecture signifies a leap toward cognitively self-aligning vehicular ecosystems, setting a new frontier in quantum-assisted edge computing and vehicular intelligence.
