AB  - Explainable Artificial Intelligence is a recent research direction that aims to explain the results of the Deep learning model. However, many recent research need to go into depth in evaluating the effective-ness of deep learning models in classifying image objects. For that reason, the research proposes two stages in the process of applying Explainable Artificial Intelligence, including: (1) assessing the accuracy of the deep learning model through evaluation methods, (2) using Grad-CAM for model interpretation aims to evaluate the feature detection ability of an image when recognized by deep learning models. The deep learning models included in the evaluation included VGG16, ResNet50, ResNet50V2, Xception, EfficientNetV2, Incep-tionV3, DenseNet201, MobileNetV2, MobileNet, NasNetMobile, RegNetX002, and InceptionResNetV2 on our updated VegNet dataset is available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/enalis/tomatoes-dataset. The results show that the MobieNet model has high accuracy but less reliability than EfficientNetV2S and Xception. However, MobileNetV2's accuracy is the highest when considering the ratio match rate. The research results contribute to the construction of intelligent agricultural support systems (using automatic fruit-picking robots, removing poor-quality fruits,...) from the results of the Explainable AI model to be able to use the optimal deep learning model in processing.

AB  - To advance evidence-based urban design prioritizing non-motorized mobility, this study proposes a street view-enabled explainable machine learning framework that systematically links built environment semantics to non-motorized transportation vitality optimization. By integrating Baidu Street View images with deep learning-based object detection (Faster R-CNN), we quantify fine-grained human-powered and mechanically assisted mobility vitality. These features are fused with multi-source geospatial data encompassing 23 built environment variables into an interpretable machine learning pipeline using SHAP-optimized random forest models. The key findings reveal distinct nonlinear response patterns between HP and MA modes to built environment factors; for instance, a notable promotion in mechanically assisted NMT vitality is observed as enterprise density increases beyond 0.2 facilities per ha. Emergent synergistic and threshold effects are evident from variable interactions requiring multidimensional planning consideration, as demonstrated in phenomena such as the peaking of human-powered NMT vitality occurring at public facility densities of 0.2-0.8 facilities per ha, enterprise densities of 0.6-1 facilities per ha, and spatial heterogeneity patterns identified through Bivariate Local Moran's I clustering. This research contributes an innovative technical framework combining street view image recognition with explainable AI, while practically informing urban planning through evidence-based mobility zone classification and targeted strategy formulation, enabling more precise optimization of pedestrian-/cyclist-oriented urban spaces.

AB  - Achieving sustainable green building design is essential to reducing our environmental impact and enhancing energy efficiency. Traditional methods often depend heavily on expert knowledge and subjective decisions, posing significant challenges. This research addresses these issues by introducing an innovative framework that integrates building information modeling (BIM), explainable artificial intelligence (AI), and multi-objective optimization. The framework includes three main components: data generation through DesignBuilder simulation, a BO-LGBM (Bayesian optimization-LightGBM) predictive model with LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) for energy prediction and interpretation, and the multi-objective optimization technique AGE-MOEA to address uncertainties. A case study demonstrates the framework's effectiveness, with the BO-LGBM model achieving high prediction accuracy (R-squared > 93.4%, MAPE < 2.13%) and LIME identifying significant HVAC system features. The AGE-MOEA optimization resulted in a 13.43% improvement in energy consumption, CO2 emissions, and thermal comfort, with an additional 4.0% optimization gain when incorporating uncertainties. This study enhances the transparency of machine learning predictions and efficiently identifies optimal passive and active design solutions, contributing significantly to sustainable construction practices. Future research should focus on validating its real-world applicability, assessing its generalizability across various building types, and integrating generative design capabilities for automated optimization.

AB  - The paper proposes an explainable Artificial Intelligence model that can be used in credit risk management and, in particular, in measuring the risks that arise when credit is borrowed employing peer to peer lending platforms. The model applies correlation networks to Shapley values so that Artificial Intelligence predictions are grouped according to the similarity in the underlying explanations. The empirical analysis of 15,000 small and medium companies asking for credit reveals that both risky and not risky borrowers can be grouped according to a set of similar financial characteristics, which can be employed to explain their credit score and, therefore, to predict their future behaviour.

AB  - This paper proposes an explainable machine learning model for predicting credit default using a real-world data set provided by a Norwegian bank. We combine a Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) model with Shapley additive explanations (SHAP), an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework that enables the interpretation of explanatory variables affecting the predictions. Using the LightGBM model, we achieve a 1% increase in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and a 19% increase in the area under the precision recall curve compared with an industry-standard logistic regression model. An empirical analysis using SHAP on the explanatory variables is also conducted. Our main contribution is the exploration of how the implementation of XAI methods can be applied in banking to improve the interpretability and reliability of state-of-the-art machine learning models. We specifically find that LightGBM models may outperform logistic regression models for credit scoring in terms of both predictive performance and explainability.

AB  - The increasing complexity of manufacturing processes demands accurate defect prediction and interpretable insights into the causes of quality issues. This study proposes a methodology integrating machine learning, clustering, and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to support defect analysis and quality control in industrial environments. Using a dataset based on empirical industrial distributions, we train an XGBoost model to classify high- and low-defect scenarios from multidimensional production and quality metrics. The model demonstrates high predictive performance and is analyzed using five XAI techniques (SHAP, LIME, ELI5, PDP, and ICE) to identify the most influential variables linked to defective outcomes. In parallel, we apply Fuzzy C-Means and K-means to segment production data into latent operational profiles, which are also interpreted using XAI to uncover process-level patterns. This approach provides both global and local interpretability, revealing consistent variables across predictive and structural perspectives. After a thorough review, no prior studies have combined supervised learning, unsupervised clustering, and XAI within a unified framework for manufacturing defect analysis. The results demonstrate that this integration enables a transparent, data-driven understanding of production dynamics. The proposed hybrid approach supports the development of intelligent, explainable Industry 4.0 systems.

AB  - Disasters can have devastating impacts on communities and economies, underscoring the urgent need for effective strategic disaster risk management (DRM). Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds the potential to enhance DRM through improved decision-making processes, its inherent complexity and "black box" nature have led to a growing demand for Explainable AI (XAI) techniques. These techniques facilitate the interpretation and understanding of decisions made by AI models, promoting transparency and trust. However, the current state of XAI applications in DRM, their achievements, and the challenges they face remain underexplored. In this systematic literature review, we delve into the burgeoning domain of XAI-DRM, extracting 195 publications from the Scopus and ISI Web of Knowledge databases, and selecting 68 for detailed analysis based on predefined exclusion criteria. Our study addresses pertinent research questions, identifies various hazard and disaster types, risk components, and AI and XAI methods, uncovers the inherent challenges and limitations of these approaches, and provides synthesized insights to enhance their explainability and effectiveness in disaster decision-making. Notably, we observed a significant increase in the use of XAI techniques for DRM in 2022 and 2023, emphasizing the growing need for transparency and interpretability. Through a rigorous methodology, we offer key research directions that can serve as a guide for future studies. Our recommendations highlight the importance of multi-hazard risk analysis, the integration of XAI in early warning systems and digital twins, and the incorporation of causal inference methods to enhance DRM strategy planning and effectiveness. This study serves as a beacon for researchers and practitioners alike, illuminating the intricate interplay between XAI and DRM, and revealing the profound potential of AI solutions in revolutionizing disaster risk management.

AB  - This groundbreaking study introduces a novel approach employing Extreme Fine -Tuning (XFT) combined with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) for the accurate, non destructive prediction of concrete compressive strength. By analyzing a state-of-the-art dataset containing 18,480 data points, this study developed a deep neural network that, through extensive hyperparameter optimization, achieves unprecedented prediction accuracy of approximately 98.7%. The novelty of this research lies in the sophisticated integration of XFT and XAI techniques, which not only significantly enhances prediction accuracy but also provides insightful explanations of the model's decision -making process, shedding light on the factors influencing concrete strength. This dual focus on accuracy and explainability represents a significant advancement in the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in material science and civil engineering, offering a powerful tool for researchers and practitioners. This study culminates in a model that outperforms existing methodologies in predicting concrete compressive strength, with an accuracy superior to 98.5% in both instances, testing and validation. By integrating XAI into this approach, we have also opened new avenues for understanding the complex relationships between concrete composition and its mechanical properties. This study marks a substantial step forward in the nondestructive evaluation of construction materials. It sets a new benchmark for transparency and interpretability in AI models within the engineering domain.

AB  - Explanations are conceived to ensure the trustworthiness of AI systems. Yet, relying solemnly on algorithmic solutions, as provided by explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), might fall short to account for sociotechnical risks jeopardizing their factuality and informativeness. To mitigate these risks, we delve into the complex landscape of ethical risks surrounding XAI systems and their generated explanations. By employing a literature review combined with rigorous thematic analysis, we uncover a diverse array of technical risks tied to the robustness, fairness, and evaluation of XAI systems. Furthermore, we address a broader range of contextual risks jeopardizing their security, accountability, reception alongside other cognitive, social, and ethical concerns of explanations. We advance a multi-layered risk assessment framework, where each layer advances strategies for practical intervention, management, and documentation of XAI systems within organizations. Recognizing the theoretical nature of the framework advanced, we discuss it in a conceptual case study. For the XAI community, our multifaceted investigation represents a path to practically address XAI risks while enriching our understanding of the ethical ramifications of incorporating XAI in decision-making processes.

AB  - Explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) provides a better understanding of the decision-making processes and results generated by black-box machine learning (ML) models. Here, we outline several xAI techniques in order to equip risk managers with more explainable ML methods. We illustrate this by describing an application for the more effective management of paid-up risk in insurance savings products. We draw on a database of real universal life policies to fit an initial logistic regression model and several tree-based models. We then use different xAI techniques, including a novel approach that leverages a Kohonen network of Shapley values, to offer valuable perspectives on tree-based models to the end-user. Based on these findings, we show how non-trivial ideas can emerge to improve paid-up risk management.

AB  - Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is a burgeoning concept. It is gaining prominence as an approach to better understand how artificial intelligence solutions' outputs can improve decision making. Evaluation frameworks to enable organizations to understand XAIs what, why, how, and when are yet to be developed. Thus, we aim to fill this void by developing a conceptual content, context, process, and outcome (CCPO) evaluation framework to justify XAIs adoption and effective management using construction organizations as a backdrop for the article's setting. After introducing and describing the proposed novel CCPO framework for operationalizing XAI, we discuss its implications for future research. The contributions of our article are twofold: First, it highlights the need for organizations to embrace and enact XAI so that decision makers and stakeholders can better understand why and how a specific prediction materializes; and second, it provides a frame of reference for organizations to realize the business value and benefits of XAI.

AB  - While artificial intelligence (AI), and by extension machine learning (ML), continues to be adopted in parallel engineering disciplines, the integration of AI/ML into the structural engineering domain remains minutus. This resistance towards AI and ML primarily stems from two folds: 1) the fact that coding/programming is not a frequent element in structural engineering curricula, and 2) these methods are displayed as blackboxes; the opposite of that often favored by structural engineering education and industry (i.e., testing, empirical analysis, numerical simulation, etc.). Naturally, structural engineers are reluctant to leverage AI/ML during their tenure as such technology is viewed as opaque. In the rare instances of engineers adopting AI/ML, a clear emphasis is displayed towards chasing goodness metrics to imply "viable" inference. However, and just like the notion of correlation does not infer causation, forced goodness is prone to indicate a false sense of inference. To overcome this challenge, this paper advocates for a modern form of AI, one that is humanly explainable; thereby eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and interpretable machine learning (IML). Thus, this work dives into the inner workings of a typical analysis to demystify how AI/ML model predictions can be evaluated and interpreted through a collection of agnostic methods (e.g., feature importance, partial dependence plots, feature interactions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), and surrogates) via a thorough examination of a case study carried out on a comprehensive database compiled on reinforced concrete (RC) beams strengthened with fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composite laminates. In this case study, three algorithms, namely: Extreme Gradient Boosted Trees (ExGBT), Light gradient boosted trees (LGBT), and Keras Deep Neural Networks (KDNN), are applied to predict the maximum moment capacity of FRP-strengthened beams and the propensity of the FRP system to fail under various mechanisms. Finally, a philosophical engineering perspective into future research directions pertaining to this domain is presented and articulated.

AB  - Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has gained significant attention as a means to address the transparency and interpretability challenges posed by black box AI models. In the context of the manufacturing industry, where complex problems and decision-making processes are widespread, the XMANAI platform emerges as a solution to enable transparent and trustworthy collaboration between humans and machines. By leveraging advancements in XAI and catering the prompt collaboration between data scientists and domain experts, the platform enables the construction of interpretable AI models that offer high transparency without compromising performance. This paper introduces the approach to building the XMANAI platform and highlights its potential to resolve the "transparency paradox" of AI. The platform not only addresses technical challenges related to transparency but also caters to the specific needs of the manufacturing industry, including lifecycle management, security, and trusted sharing of AI assets. The paper provides an overview of the XMANAI platform main functionalities, addressing the challenges faced during the development and presenting the evaluation framework to measure the performance of the delivered XAI solutions. It also demonstrates the benefits of the XMANAI approach in achieving transparency in manufacturing decision-making, fostering trust and collaboration between humans and machines, improving operational efficiency, and optimizing business value.

AB  - The greatest technological transformation the world has ever seen was brought about by artificial intelligence (AI). It presents significant opportunities for the financial sector to enhance risk management, democratize financial services, ensure consumer protection, and improve customer experience. Modern machine learning models are more accessible than ever, but it has been challenging to create and implement systems that support real-world financial applications, primarily due to their lack of transparency and explainability-both of which are essential for building trustworthy technology. The novelty of this study lies in the development of an explainable AI (XAI) model that not only addresses these transparency concerns but also serves as a tool for policy development in credit risk management. By offering a clear understanding of the underlying factors influencing AI predictions, the proposed model can assist regulators and financial institutions in shaping data-driven policies, ensuring fairness, and enhancing trust. This study proposes an explainable AI model for credit risk management, specifically aimed at quantifying the risks associated with credit borrowing through peer-to-peer lending platforms. The model leverages Shapley values to generate AI predictions based on key explanatory variables. The decision tree and random forest models achieved the highest accuracy levels of 0.89 and 0.93, respectively. The model's performance was further tested using a larger dataset, where it maintained stable accuracy levels, with the decision tree and random forest models reaching accuracies of 0.90 and 0.93, respectively. To ensure reliable explainable AI (XAI) modeling, these models were chosen due to the binary classification nature of the problem. LIME and SHAP were employed to present the XAI models as both local and global surrogates.

AB  - The modern era of machine learning is focused on data-driven solutions. While this has resulted in astonishing leaps in numerous applications, explainability has not witnessed the same growth. The reality is, most machine learning solutions are black boxes. Herein, we focus on data/information fusion in machine learning. Specifically, we explore four eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) questions relative to Choquet integral; (i) what is the quality of our inputs and their interactions, (ii) how is the information being combined, (iii) what is the quality of our training data (and thus our learned models), and (iv) what trust do we place in an output? Previously, we derived an initial set of indices for (i)-(iv) on the premise of perfect knowledge. Herein, we make XAI more accurate by taking into consideration what the machine learned. A combination of synthetic data and real-world experiments from remote sensing for fusing deep learners in the context of classification are explored. Our approach leads to performance gain, insights into what was learned, and it helps us realize better future solutions.

AB  - With increasing electronic medical data and the development of artificial intelligence, clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) assist clinicians in diagnosis and prescription. Traditional knowledge-based CDSSs follow an accumulated medical knowledgebase and a predefined rule system, which clarifies the decision-making process; however, maintenance cost issues exist in the medical data quality control and standardization processes. Non-knowledge-based CDSSs utilize vast amounts of data and algorithms to effectively make decisions; however, the deep learning black-box problem causes unreliable results. EXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)-based CDSSs provide valid rationales and explainable results. These systems ensure trustworthiness and transparency by showing the recommendation and prediction result process using explainable techniques. However, existing systems have limitations, such as the scope of data utilization and the lack of explanatory power of AI models. This study proposes a new XAI-based CDSS framework to address these issues; introduces resources, datasets, and models that can be utilized; and provides a foundation model to support decision-making in various disease domains. Finally, we propose future directions for CDSS technology and highlight societal issues that need to be addressed to emphasize the potential of CDSSs in the future.

This study investigated the performance and interpretability of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for this task. Using the rice and banana datasets, we compared three CNN architectures (CNN, VGG-16, Inception-V3). Inception-V3 achieved the highest accuracy (93% for rice and banana), but simpler models such as VGG-16 might be easier to understand. To address this trade-off, we employed Explainable AI (XAI) techniques (SHAP and Grad-CAM) to gain insights into model decision-making. This study emphasises the importance of both accuracy and interpretability in agricultural AI and demonstrates the value of XAI for building trust in these models.

AB  - Plant diseases can have profound effects on the economy, impacting both local and global scales. These diseases can lead to substantial losses in agricultural productivity, affecting crop yields and quality. In this context, deep learning algorithms are widely acknowledged as effective solutions. However, the use of these black-box approaches raises concerns about trust in interpreting and validating the decisions generated by the models. This study proposes an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) based plant disease classification system to classify and identify distinct ailments with improved accuracy. The system correctly identifies 38 different plant diseases with accuracy, precision, and recall as 99.69%, 98.27%, and 98.26%, respectively. These predictions are subjected to additional analysis employing the local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) framework to produce visual explanations aligning with prior beliefs and adhering to established best practices in explanations. This system will serve as a promising avenue for revolutionizing disease detection, fostering informed decision-making, and ultimately contributing to global food security.

AB  - The advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has accelerated the development of several systems that are elicited from it. This boom has made the systems vulnerable to security attacks and allows considerable bias in order to handle errors in the system. This puts humans at risk and leaves machines, robots, and data defenseless. Trustworthy AI (TAI) guarantees human value and the environment. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art on how to build a Trustworthy and eXplainable AI, taking into account that AI is a black box with little insight into its underlying structure. The paper also discusses various TAI components, their corresponding bias, and inclinations that make the system unreliable. The study also discusses the necessity for TAI in many verticals, including banking, healthcare, autonomous system, and IoT.

AB  - Accurately predicting building information modeling (BIM) user satisfaction (US) is essential for proactively addressing implementation challenges, ensuring effective adoption, and maximizing return on investment in BIM technologies in construction projects. Accordingly, this study developed advanced, interpretable boosting ensemble models to predict BIM US by integrating the forensic-based investigation (FBI) algorithm with gradient boosting machine, light gradient boosting machine, adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), extreme gradient boosting, and random forest algorithms. To validate the proposed models and establish a dataset, a comprehensive survey was conducted on 70 construction projects in Taiwan that used BIM technologies to support design work. Subsequently, the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) was integrated into the proposed models to address the data imbalance problem. The results indicated that among all models, the FBI-AdaBoost-SMOTE model exhibited the highest performance, achieving accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores of 88.6 %, 90.6 %, 88.6 %, and 87.8 %, respectively. The FBI-AdaBoost model based on Shapley additive explanations identified contextual analysis and visualization, project scale, and cost estimates as key determinants of BIM US. Overall, this study presents an advanced machine learning framework for predicting BIM US and identifying key influencing factors for BIM US. It also provides actionable insights for stakeholders to enhance BIM implementation and user experience. In addition, this study highlights the potential of predictive modeling for optimizing the adoption of BIM in the architecture, engineering, and construction industry.

AB  - The rising demand for energy requires high investments in network extensions and renewable sources, alongside replacing inefficient systems. Smart maintenance is important in minimizing unscheduled outages, reducing costs, improving network security, and increasing equipment's life expectancy. The vast amount of data collected by sensors and measurements in energy networks makes it hard for humans to detect failures continuously. Thanks to recent breakthroughs in AI, the energy sector has boosted the use of intelligent algorithms in this field. Despite the widespread popularity and great results of machine learning (ML) models in many applications, they are mostly nevertheless considered "black boxes" as understanding their functionality and transparency in real-world applications is challenging. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) tackles this by making AI systems' decision-making processes transparent and interpretable. This review paper will not only make the roadmap clear but also ensure an in-depth awareness of the challenges, opportunities, and developments associated with this path by presenting two comprehensive taxonomies. Various XAI methods are compared; as an example, our findings show that SHAP offers high trustworthiness but is less suited for real-time use, while LIME provides faster solutions with lower trustworthiness. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first survey that provides an overview of XAI methods for energy systems maintenance (ESM). It addresses challenges like integrating XAI with IoT-powered digital twins, balancing explainability with cybersecurity, and ensuring scalability while proposing solutions to enhance reliability and efficiency.

AB  - Recent studies focus on machine learning (ML) algorithms for predicting employee churn (ECn) to save probable economic loss, technology leakage, and customer and knowledge transference. However, can human resource professionals rely on algorithms for prediction? Can they decide when the process of prediction is not known? Due to the lack of interpretability, ML models' exclusive nature and growing intricacy make it challenging for field experts to comprehend these multifaceted black boxes. To address the concern of interpretability, trust and transparency of black-box predictions, this study explores the application of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in identifying the factors that escalate the ECn, analysing the negative impact on productivity, employee morale and financial stability. We propose a predictive model that compares the best two top-performing algorithms based on the performance metrics. Thereafter, we suggest applying an explainable artificial intelligence based on Shapley values, i.e., the Shapley Additive exPlanations approach (SHAP), to identify and compare the feature importance of top-performing algorithms logistic regression and random forest analysis on our dataset. The interpretability of the predictive outcome unboxes the predictions, enhancing trust and facilitating retention strategies.

AB  - Adding basalt fibre to concrete has become a promising way to improve its strength under different loading conditions. Predicting the strength of basalt fibre reinforced concrete (BFRC) is more complex than for conventional concrete. Traditional methods rely on iterative experiments to understand the underlying behaviour. This study applies machine learning (ML) models, paired with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), to predict the compressive, flexural, and tensile strengths of BFRC efficiently and transparently. Three datasets, each with 267 samples, were used for model development. Each sample included 10 features: cement, fly ash, silica ash, coarse aggregate, fine aggregate, water, superplasticiser, fibre diameter, fibre length, and fibre content. Three ML models, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and decision tree (DT), were evaluated. RF achieved the highest accuracy for compressive (R2 = 0.926, MSE = 9.4, MAE = 2.3) and flexural strength (R2 = 0.882, MSE = 0.5, MAE = 0.5), while DT performed best for tensile strength (R2 = 0.935, MSE = 0.2, MAE = 0.3). Shapley additive explanation (SHAP)-based explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods revealed key predictors: fine aggregate for compressive strength, fibre diameter for tensile strength, and silica ash for flexural strength. Also, the authors developed a web-based online application to predict the strength (compressive, flexural and tensile) to improve the accessibility and usability of the findings. This approach offers a practical alternative to experimental testing and contributes to a better understanding of BFRC behaviour. It holds strong potential for adoption in the construction industry.

AB  - This study explores the application of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to the spectral analysis of electromagnetic field (EMF) measurements conducted across various frequency bands in Cyprus. Using an extensive data set obtained from mobile telephony, radio broadcasting, and terrestrial digital television sources, this work aims to capture real-world EMF exposure levels spanning frequencies from 30 MHz to 6 GHz. The frequency bands analyzed include FM radio (87.5-108 MHz), VHF, UHF television, and various mobile telephony zones (700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2600 MHz, and 3600 MHz), representing both traditional and emerging wireless technologies. A comparative evaluation of six machine learning algorithms was conducted: XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forests, k-Nearest Neighbors, Neural Networks and Decision Trees to assess prediction performance across each frequency band. Furthermore, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was employed to elucidate the contribution of spatial and demographic characteristics to the intensity of the EMF. The results show that ensemble tree-based methods, particularly Random Forests and LightGBM, consistently outperformed simpler models in accuracy and interpretability. The integration of SHAP enabled transparent feature attribution, revealing distinctive exposure patterns linked to urban topology, population density, and built environment metrics. This approach enables data-driven EMF exposure mapping, aiding urban infrastructure planning, compliance monitoring, and public health risk evaluation.

AB  - This study advances the field of Computationally Intensive Theory Development (CTD) by examining the capabilities of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), in particular SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), for theory development, while providing guidelines for this process. We evaluate SHAP's methodological abilities and develop a structured approach for using SHAP to harness insights from black-box predictive models. For this purpose, we leverage a dual-methodological approach. First, to assess SHAP's capabilities in uncovering patterns that shape a phenomenon, we conduct a Monte-Carlo simulation study. Second, to illustrate and guide the theory development process with SHAP for CTD, we apply SHAP in a use-case using real-world data. Based on these analyses, we propose a stepwise uniform and replicable approach giving guidance that can benefit rigorous theory development and increase the traceability of the theorizing process. With our structured approach, we contribute to the use of XAI approaches in research and, by uncovering patterns in black-box prediction models, add to the ongoing search for next-generation theorizing methods in the field of Information Systems (IS).

AB  - Visual inspection tasks often require humans to cooperate with artificial intelligence (AI)-based image classifiers. To enhance this cooperation, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) can highlight those image areas that have contributed to an AI decision. However, the literature on visual cueing suggests that such XAI support might come with costs of its own. To better understand how the benefits and cost of XAI depend on the accuracy of AI classifications and XAI highlights, we conducted two experiments that simulated visual quality control in a chocolate factory. Participants had to decide whether chocolate molds contained faulty bars or not, and were always informed whether the AI had classified the mold as faulty or not. In half of the experiment, they saw additional XAI highlights that justified this classification. While XAI speeded up performance, its effects on error rates were highly dependent on (X)AI accuracy. XAI benefits were observed when the system correctly detected and highlighted the fault, but XAI costs were evident for misplaced highlights that marked an intact area while the actual fault was located elsewhere. Eye movement analyses indicated that participants spent less time searching the rest of the mold and thus looked at the fault less often. However, we also observed large interindividual differences. Taken together, the results suggest that despite its potentials, XAI can discourage people from investing effort into their own information analysis.

AB  - Faults in the wafer transfer robots (WTRs) used in semiconductor manufacturing processes can significantly affect productivity. This study defines high-risk components such as bearing motors, ball screws, timing belts, robot hands, and end effectors, and generates fault data for each component based on Fluke's law. A stacking classifier was applied for fault prediction and severity classification, and logistic regression was used to identify fault components. Additionally, to analyze the frequency bands affecting each failed component and assess the severity of faults involving two mixed components, a hybrid explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) model combining Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) was employed to inform the user about the component causing the fault. This approach demonstrated a high prediction accuracy of 95%, and its integration into real-time monitoring systems is expected to reduce maintenance costs, decrease equipment downtime, and ultimately improve productivity.

AB  - Digitalization and technologization affect numerous domains, promising advantages but also entailing risks. Hence, when decision-makers in highly-regulated domains like Finance implement these technological advances-especially Artificial Intelligence-regulators prescribe high levels of transparency, assuring the traceability of decisions for third parties. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is of tremendous importance in this context. We provide an overview of current research on XAI in Finance with a systematic literature review screening 2,022 articles from leading Finance, Information Systems, and Computer Science outlets. We identify a set of 60 relevant articles, classify them according to the used XAI methods and goals that they aim to achieve, and provide an overview of XAI methods used in different Finance areas. Areas like risk management, portfolio optimization, and applications around the stock market are well-researched, while anti-money laundering is understudied. Researchers implement both transparent models and post-hoc explainability, while they recently favored the latter.

AB  - While the complexity of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) processes facilitates customized and metal-based functional parts to be built, existing process monitoring techniques have limitations. Therefore, the need for intricate process monitoring has grown. Non-uniform emission readings are correlated with overheating. Therefore, process monitoring of areas experiencing excess thermal emission during print to track potential overheating is needed. A process monitoring technique using deep neural network-long short-term memory (DNN-LSTM) deep learning (DL) models for emission tracking has been developed. The DNN component harnesses process parameters, while the LSTM harnesses the time-series emission structure on multiple sets of prints in parallel. Moreover, trust and interpretation of the opaque methodology are needed to make the process widely applicable. Existing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods are inoperative with the model developed. We overcome this gap by developing an attribution-based XAI-enabled DNN-LSTM for predicting, explaining, and evaluating layer-wise emission prediction. Interpretation from attribution-based methods, namely, Shapley additive explanations, integrated gradient explanations, and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations, reveal an estimate of how each physics variable (process parameters, layer number, layer-wise average emission readings) impacts each future layer-wise average emission behavior as decided by the DL model. Finally, existing evaluation metrics of XAI are mostly domain-focused. We overcome this gap by establishing evaluation criteria appropriate for understanding the trust of the explanations in the context of thermal emission prediction for LPBF.

AB  - The transition to a sustainable energy supply challenges the operation of electric power systems in various ways. Transmission grid loads increase as wind and solar power is often installed far away from the consumers. System operators resolve grid congestion via countertrading or redispatch to ensure grid stability. While some drivers of congestion are known, the magnitude of their impact is unclear, and other factors might still be unidentified.In this study, we conduct a data-driven investigation of congestion in the German transmission grid that reveals drivers and mitigators and quantifies their impact ex-post. Specifically, we used Gradient Boosted Trees and SHAP values to develop an explainable machine learning model for the hourly volume of redispatch and countertrade. As expected, wind power generation in northern Germany emerged as the main driver. Cross-border electricity trading, especially with Denmark, also plays an important role. German solar power has very little effect. Furthermore, our results suggest that run-of-river generation in the alpine region has a strong mitigating effect. Our results support the idea that market design changes, e.g., a bidding zone split, could contribute to congestion prevention.

AB  - Rational: Deep learning (DL) has demonstrated a remarkable performance in diagnostic imaging for various diseases and modalities and therefore has a high potential to be used as a clinical tool. However, current practice shows low deployment of these algorithms in clinical practice, because DL algorithms lack transparency and trust due to their underlying black-box mechanism. For successful employment, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) could be introduced to close the gap between the medical professionals and the DL algorithms. In this literature review, XAI methods available for magnetic resonance (MR), computed tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging are discussed and future suggestions are made.Methods: PubMed, and Clarivate Analytics/Web of Science Core Collection were screened. Articles were considered eligible for inclusion if XAI was used (and well described) to describe the behavior of a DL model used in MR, CT and PET imaging.Results: A total of 75 articles were included of which 54 and 17 articles described post and ad hoc XAI methods, respectively, and 4 articles described both XAI methods. Major variations in performance is seen between the methods. Overall, post hoc XAI lacks the ability to provide class-discriminative and target-specific explanation. Ad hoc XAI seems to tackle this because of its intrinsic ability to explain. However, quality control of the XAI methods is rarely applied and therefore systematic comparison between the methods is difficult.Conclusion: There is currently no clear consensus on how XAI should be deployed in order to close the gap between medical professionals and DL algorithms for clinical implementation. We advocate for systematic technical and clinical quality assessment of XAI methods. Also, to ensure end-to-end unbiased and safe integration of XAI in clinical workflow, (anatomical) data minimization and quality control methods should be included.

AB  - During the learning process, a child develops a mental representation of the task he or she is learning. A Machine Learning algorithm develops also a latent representation of the task it learns. We investigate the development of the knowledge construction of an artificial agent through the analysis of its behavior, i.e., its sequences of moves while learning to perform the Tower of Hanoi (TOH) task. The TOH is a well-known task in experimental contexts to study the problem-solving processes and one of the fundamental processes of children's knowledge construction about their world. We position ourselves in the field of explainable reinforcement learning for developmental robotics, at the crossroads of cognitive modeling and explainable AI. Our main contribution proposes a 3-step methodology named Implicit Knowledge Extraction with eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (IKE-XAI) to extract the implicit knowledge, in form of an automaton, encoded by an artificial agent during its learning. We showcase this technique to solve and explain the TOH task when researchers have only access to moves that represent observational behavior as in human-machine interaction. Therefore, to extract the agent acquired knowledge at different stages of its training, our approach combines: first, a Q-learning agent that learns to perform the TOH task; second, a trained recurrent neural network that encodes an implicit representation of the TOH task; and third, an XAI process using a post-hoc implicit rule extraction algorithm to extract finite state automata. We propose using graph representations as visual and explicit explanations of the behavior of the Q-learning agent. Our experiments show that the IKE-XAI approach helps understanding the development of the Q-learning agent behavior by providing a global explanation of its knowledge evolution during learning. IKE-XAI also allows researchers to identify the agent's Aha! moment by determining from what moment the knowledge representation stabilizes and the agent no longer learns. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Urban sustainability and reduced carbon emissions have become critical challenges in contemporary urban development, with residents' daily travel distances significantly impacting both the environmental and social aspects of city life. Despite extensive research on travel behavior, Crossroads Density: Number of Crossroads within 500m the complex relationship between the built environment and travel behavior remains inadequately understood due to the limitations of traditional linear analyses. To address this gap, this study introduces an analytical approach grounded in an interpretable machine learning framework to investigate the pivotal environmental factors influencing residents' daily travel distances and to understand their underlying mechanisms. Initially, a variety of machine learning regression models were constructed to evaluate their predictive efficacy regarding residents' daily travel distances. Among these, the CatBoost model demonstrated the most accurate fit, highlighting the robustness of the methodology. Subsequently, the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) methodology was employed to ascertain the significance of each feature's contribution, thereby elucidating the extent and non-linear dynamics of various built environmental indicators on travel distances. The findings indicate that the POI (Point of Interest) diversity index, the proportion of main roads, the proximity to the city center, and other factors significantly influence residents' travel distances, exhibiting observable interactive effects. Importantly, these results underscore the implications of the built environment on travel behavior, offering actionable insights for urban planners. By focusing on the built environment's impact on travel distances, this study's interpretable machine learning framework delves into the multi-factorial non-linear correlations, providing a valuable tool for enhancing urban spatial planning, reducing travel distances, lowering traffic emissions, and thereby contributing to the sustainable development of cities.

AB  - This study presents a comprehensive decision-making framework that employs eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)-based methods to improve proactive road transport safety management, which is critical for global supply chain networks. The framework offers explainable predictions as well as suggestions pertaining to the near-future digitization of safety tools and their usage, customized for road transport safety management. We employed four black-box machine learning-based models-artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-in this setting to enhance our comprehension of the crash-related risk factors that contribute to the severity of traffic accident injuries. Due to their opaqueness and complex inner workings, stakeholders often perceive these models as data-driven black-box approaches, making them incapable of providing an efficient decisionsupport tool. The recommended decision support incorporates agreement levels for predictions and interpretation across various XAI modeling paradigms. We deploy PFI (Permutation Feature Importance) and FIRM (Feature Importance Ranking Measures) tools to evaluate the extent of agreement in explainability between these various modeling approaches. The recommendations are based on PFI and FIRM values of highly performing models. We execute the framework as an illustration of the concept using a real crash dataset obtained from the NHTSA (National Highway Transportation Safety Administration of the United States) and report end-user feedback for use by transport policymakers.

AB  - The technology development cycle continues to accelerate, and novelty analysis is becoming increasingly important for R & D planning as well as in the patent application process. Recently, thanks to significant advances in both text mining and natural language processing, researchers started to look into AI-assisted novelty analysis of technical content including patents. However, existing language models do not take into account the unique characteristics of technical elements in patent documents nor do they provide any explanation of their decisions including which technical elements represent a novelty. Therefore, we developed an eXplainable AI (XAI) model that evaluates novelty, takes into account the claim structure of a patent, and provides an explanation. The proposed framework of an XAI model for patent novelty consists of the following three parts: (1) dataset construction, (2) model architecture, and (3) inference process. The training dataset for patent novelty is constructed using a full-text dataset provided by the European Patent Office (EPO). A self-explainable novelty classification model is proposed and investigated. Using the fitted model, the inference results are then analyzed by extracting patents in the field of vehicle communication networks. The inference process is done by applying the fitted model to patents in the vehicle communication network field and can be expanded to address potential applications. The performance of the proposed model is then verified by comparing it with the results of similar studies. We also discuss practical applications from the perspective of patent examiners and technical planning practitioners. This study involves both an academic contribution that uses a novel approach to technology management via an XAI model and a practical contribution that can be used for patent analysis.

AB  - Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) are both branches of AI. As a form of AI, ML automatically adapts to changing datasets with minimal human interference. Deep learning is a subset of ML that uses artificial neural networks to imitate the learning process of the human brain. The 'black box' nature of ML and DL makes their inner workings difficult to understand and interpret. Deploying explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) can help explain why and how the output of ML and DL models are generated. As a result, understanding a model's functioning, behavior, and outputs can be garnered, reducing bias and error and improving confidence in decision-making. Despite providing an improved understanding of model outputs, XAI has received limited attention in construction. This paper presents a narrative review of XAI and a taxonomy of precepts and models to raise awareness about its potential opportunities for use in construction. It is envisaged that the opportunities suggested can stimulate new lines of inquiry to help alleviate the prevailing skepticism and hesitancy toward AI adoption and integration in construction.

AB  - In the rapidly evolving risk management domain, Explainable AI (XAI) has transitioned from a theoretical concept to an indispensable tool, empowering decision-makers with deeper insights to make informed decisions. However, the reliability of these decisions hinges on the trustworthiness of XAI outputs. Though traditional XAI models shed light on decision-influencing factors, they should also guarantee the accuracy of their explanations. This is particularly critical when future decisions are influenced by various uncertain factors, necessitating a trustworthy determination of factors influencing those decisions. This paper introduces the Instance-based XAI for Uncertain and Dynamic Decisions (IXAI-UDD) framework to achieve this aim. IXAIUDD combines instance-based learning with transparent, supervised, and unsupervised algorithms to enable decision-makers to adjust the feature values in light of uncertainties. This is used to first accurately identify the decision output fora given time slot and subsequently determine the key features affecting that output. In our case scenario, the framework achieved an accuracy rate of 96% for high, low, and safe risk classifications while identifying contributing features with over 85% precision across multiple time slots. This enables effective management of uncertainties or anomalies impacting the input data before determining the output and the features leading to that output. To validate the accuracy and reliability of IXAI-UDD outputs, we employ Mosaic for precision assessment and Heatmaps for multi-class evaluation. This comprehensive methodology enhances the decision-maker's understanding of risk factors, improving risk management strategies in dynamic, uncertain environments.

AB  - This study investigates the performance of four boosting machine learning models, AdaBoost, XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM, for forecasting maximal (Tmax) and minimal (Tmin) air temperatures at six lead times: the same day and 1, 7, 15, 21, and 30 days ahead. Daily temperature data from the USGS 02187010 weather station (South Carolina, USA) were used for model training and validation. To address the challenges posed by the non-linearity and complexity of climate data, the models were integrated with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, specifically SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), which provide insights into the role of input features in shaping predictions. Results indicate that forecasting accuracy declines with increasing lead time. Among the tested models, CatBoost1 consistently exhibited the best performance. For Tmax forecasting on the validation set, CatBoost1 yielded a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.900, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 0.810, root mean squared error (RMSE) of 3.447 degrees C, mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.571 degrees C, Willmott's Index (WI) of 0.947, Legates and McCabe Index (LM) of 0.615, explained variance score (EVS) of 0.810, and absolute percentage bias (APB) of 15.415%. For Tmin, CatBoost1 achieved R = 0.941, NSE = 0.885, RMSE = 2.618 degrees C, MAE = 1.952 degrees C, WI = 0.969, LM = 0.709, EVS = 0.885, and APB = 54.360%. These findings demonstrate that boosting models, when combined with explainable AI techniques, offer a robust and transparent framework for temperature forecasting, supporting their application in climate risk management, agriculture, and energy planning.

AB  - Understanding the factors influencing truck emissions remains critical for sustainable urban freight transport development. However, ignoring spatiotemporal and policy heterogeneity may lead to inaccurate predictions for specific regions and misinterpretation of outcomes. This study develops a comprehensive framework to analyze the nonlinear effects of the built environment on heavy-duty diesel truck emissions, utilizing large-scale GPS data from Shanghai, China. We introduce an interpretable predictive model that integrates random effects with a light gradient boosting machine to account for spatiotemporal and policy influences. The results show that proposed model outperforms baseline by 15 %-20 %, with an improvement exceeding 17 % in the more complex tasks of localized predictions in central urban areas. Land use and road design factors contribute 72.26 % to truck emissions, with industrial land density as the primary driver. Furthermore, the relationship between these factors and pollution emissions exhibits pronounced non-linearity, with threshold effects that vary under various policy restrictions.

AB  - The remarkable advancements in machine learning (ML) have led to its extensive adoption in Project Risk Management (PRM), leveraging its powerful predictive capabilities and data-driven insights that support proactive decision-making. Nevertheless, the "black-box" nature of ML models obscures the reasoning behind predictions, undermining transparency and trust. To address this, existing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, such as Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), Global Priors-based LIME (G-LIME), and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), have been applied to interpret black-box models. Yet, they face considerable limitations in PRM, including their inability to model cascading effects and multi-level dependencies among risk factors, suffering from inconsistencies due to random sampling, and failure to capture non-linear interactions in high-dimensional risk data. In response to these shortcomings, this paper proposes the Multi-Module eXplainable Artificial Intelligence framework for Project Risk Management (MMXAI-PRM), a novel approach designed to address the unique demands of PRM. The framework consists of three modules: the Risk Relationship Insight Module (RRIM), which models risk dependencies using a Knowledge Graph (KG); the Risk Factor Influence Analysis Module (RFIAM), which introduces a Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network-aided Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations using Kernel Ridge Regression (CTGAN-LIMEKR) to ensure explanation consistency and handle non-linearity; and the Visualization and Interpretation Module (VIM), which synthesizes these insights into an interpretable, chain-based representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MMXAI-PRM delivers more consistent, stable, and accurate explanations than existing XAI methods. By improving interpretability, it enhances trust in AI-driven risk predictions and equips project managers with actionable insights, advancing decision-making in PRM.

AB  - The rapid urbanization of Abha and its surrounding cities in Saudi Arabia's mountainous regions poses challenges for sustainable and secure development. This study aimed to identify suitable sites for eco-friendly and safe building complexes amidst complex geophysical, geoecological, and socio-economic factors, integrating natural hazards assessment and risk management. Employing the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (Fuzzy-AHP), the study constructed a suitability model incorporating sixteen parameters. Additionally, a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based on eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) conducted sensitivity analyses to assess the parameters' influence on optimal location decision making. The results reveal slope as the most crucial parameter (22.90%), followed by altitude and land use/land cover (13.24%), emphasizing topography and environmental considerations. Drainage density (11.36%) and rainfall patterns (9.15%) are also significant for flood defense and water management. Only 12.21% of the study area is deemed "highly suitable", with "no-build zones" designated for safety and environmental protection. DNN-based XAI demonstrates the positive impact of variables like the NDVI and municipal solid waste generation on site selection, informing waste management and ecological preservation strategies. This integrated methodology provides actionable insights for sustainable and safe residential development in Abha, aiding informed decision making and balancing urban expansion with environmental conservation and hazard risk reduction.

AB  - Robust optimization is an ideal solution for enhancing safety in tunnel construction in the presence of unpredictable soil conditions, especially in large-diameter tunnel construction, since it requires the least amount of information about uncertainties. However, the application of robust optimization to real-world projects is greatly hampered by its dependence on mathematical models. To address this issue, this study builds a pipeline machine learning model to forecast tunnel-induced damage that can be addressed using the robust optimization (RO) algorithm with high accuracy. The optimization process is integrated into a building information modeling (BIM) platform and analyzed using the Shapley Additive ExPlanations (SHAP) technique, allowing the designer to understand and interact with the algorithm. The average improvement of testing samples using an ellipsoidal uncertainty set with a size of 0.05 is 23.8 and 4.9% on the two selected criteria, which is more conservative than using deterministic optimization (DO) and stochastic optimization (SO). This study establishes an interactive and explainable optimization platform that enables designers to make judgments under the most unfavorable soil conditions with the least amount of accessible information about the uncertainties during tunneling.

AB  - To tackle the challenge of Red Chilli Powder adulteration (RCP), an artificial intelligence (AI)-based framework was proposed using empirical analysis of eight pre-trained two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2DCNN) models for RCP adulteration detection. Moreover, to enhance the convergence and performance of the proposed architecture, an optimiser AdamClr is integrated with minimum and maximin learning rate of 0.00005 and 0.01, respectively. The RCP is categorised into two classes; C1_PRcP includes pure RCP of Jodhpuri (JP) variety, and Class 2 (C2_ARcP) consists of various natural adulterants (i.e., wheat bran (WB), rice hull (RB), wood saw (WS), three low-grade varieties of RCP at the lowest concentration of 5 %). Additionally, the model which outperforms corresponding architectures is further evaluated using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) technology. DenseNet_169, trained at BS 64, delivers 97.99 % accuracy for detecting natural adulterants (C2_ARcP) in high-grade RCP (C1_PRcP). The XAI model (Grad-CAM and LIME) explained the accurate adulteration prediction of the DensNet_169 2D-CNN model. The heat map obtained from both XAI models illustrated the significant areas that explained the model's decision-making. The proposed model effectively detects RCP adulteration and its applicability can be enhanced by increasing dataset diversity. Overall, the integrated 2DCNN-XAI approach holds significant potential to revolutionise quality control and assurance in the food industry.

AB  - Studies on manufacturing cost prediction based on deep learning have begun in recent years, but the cost prediction rationale cannot be explained because the models are still used as a black box. This study aims to propose a manufacturing cost prediction process for 3D computer-aided design (CAD) models using explainable artificial intelligence. The proposed process can visualize the machining features of the 3D CAD model that are influencing the increase in manufacturing costs. The proposed process consists of (1) data collection and pre-processing, (2) 3D deep learning architecture exploration, and (3) visualization to explain the prediction results. The proposed deep learning model shows high predictability of manufacturing cost for the computer numerical control (CNC) machined parts. In particular, using 3D gradient-weighted class activation mapping proves that the proposed model not only can detect the CNC machining features but also can differentiate the machining difficulty for the same feature. Using the proposed process, we can provide a design guidance to engineering designers in reducing manufacturing costs during the conceptual design phase. We can also provide real-time quotations and redesign proposals to online manufacturing platform customers.

AB  - The digital transformation of the Architecture, Engineering and Construction sector is accelerating the adoption of digital platforms as critical enablers of data integration, stakeholder collaboration and process optimization. This paper presents a systematic review of 125 peer-reviewed journal articles (2015-2025), selected through a PRISMA-guided search using the Scopus database, with inclusion criteria focused on English-language academic literature on platform-enabled digitalization in the built environment. Studies were grouped into six thematic domains, i.e., artificial intelligence in construction, digital twin integration, lifecycle cost management, BIM-GIS for underground utilities, energy systems and public administration, based on a combination of literature precedent and domain relevance. Unlike existing reviews focused on single technologies or sectors, this work offers a cross-sectoral synthesis, highlighting shared challenges and opportunities across disciplines and lifecycle stages. It identifies the functional roles, enabling technologies and systemic barriers affecting digital platform adoption, such as fragmented data sources, limited interoperability between systems and siloed organizational processes. These barriers hinder the development of integrated and adaptive digital ecosystems capable of supporting real-time decision-making, participatory planning and sustainable infrastructure management. The study advocates for modular, human-centered platforms underpinned by standardized ontologies, explainable AI and participatory governance models. It also highlights the importance of emerging technologies, including large language models and federated learning, as well as context-specific platform strategies, especially for applications in the Global South.

AB  - Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) models allow for a more transparent and understandable relationship between humans and machines. The insurance industry represents a fundamental opportunity to demonstrate the potential of XAI, with the industry's vast stores of sensitive data on policyholders and centrality in societal progress and innovation. This paper analyses current Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications in insurance industry practices and insurance research to assess their degree of explainability. Using search terms representative of (X)AI applications in insurance, 419 original research articles were screened from IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Scopus, Web of Science and Business Source Complete and EconLit. The resulting 103 articles (between the years 2000-2021) representing the current state-of-the-art of XAI in insurance literature are analysed and classified, highlighting the prevalence of XAI methods at the various stages of the insurance value chain. The study finds that XAI methods are particularly prevalent in claims management, underwriting and actuarial pricing practices. Simplification methods, called knowledge distillation and rule extraction, are identified as the primary XAI technique used within the insurance value chain. This is important as the combination of large models to create a smaller, more manageable model with distinct association rules aids in building XAI models which are regularly understandable. XAI is an important evolution of AI to ensure trust, transparency and moral values are embedded within the system's ecosystem. The assessment of these XAI foci in the context of the insurance industry proves a worthwhile exploration into the unique advantages of XAI, highlighting to industry professionals, regulators and XAI developers where particular focus should be directed in the further development of XAI. This is the first study to analyse XAI's current applications within the insurance industry, while simultaneously contributing to the interdisciplinary understanding of applied XAI. Advancing the literature on adequate XAI definitions, the authors propose an adapted definition of XAI informed by the systematic review of XAI literature in insurance.

AB  - The accurate identification and classification of rice species is critical for increasing crop productivity, quality, and diversity. Traditional rice classification methods involving manual inspection can be time-consuming, costly, and error-prone. This study addresses to address this challenge by exploring the potential of machine learning (ML) models for automated and accurate rice classification. The key objectives of this paper are threefold. First, the study evaluates the discriminative power of various morphological features extracted from rice grain images using feature selection methods. Second, it compares the performance of several ML models, including Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), Gradient Boosting (GBoost), k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN), Logistic Regression (LR), Na & iuml;ve Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), in classifying two rice species (Cammeo and Osmancik). Third, the study implements explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, namely SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) and Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots, to provide transparency and interpretability into the inner workings and decision-making processes of the ML models. The findings indicate that the LR model achieved the highest classification accuracy, with a rate of 93.1%. Feature analysis identified Major Axis Length, Perimeter, Convex Area, and Area as the most influential features in distinguishing between rice species. This study highlights the successful application of advanced ML techniques in automating industrial rice classification, facilitating automated packaging and quality control processes without the need for human intervention. By improving the efficiency of rice classification and reducing reliance on manual labour, this approach offers significant benefits to both the agricultural industry and food production sectors.

AB  - The east coast of India, especially the coastal region of Odisha, is highly threatened by tropical cyclones. This study develops a detailed risk map for tropical cyclones in the coastal districts of Odisha at the micro level, focusing on the assessment of risk factors at the block level. Using a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approach, the study considers four primary risk components: Exposure, vulnerability, susceptibility, and mitigation options. The Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) framework, which uses the XGBoost model in conjunction with SHAP values, is applied to identify and elucidate the factors influencing risk levels in 69 blocks. Results indicate that about 65% of the area is at high risk to tropical cyclone, especially in the northeastern and central regions. In particular, 32 blocks are classified as high to very high-risk zones. The study shows a contrast in risk levels, with blocks in the northeast and southeast at higher risk, while blocks in the southern regions such as Ganjam and Puri and in the central parts of Kendrapara and Baleswar districts are at lower risk. The findings from this study are crucial for local authorities to identify vulnerable areas and improve cyclone preparedness and risk management strategies in Odisha.

AB  - Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has received great interest in the recent decade, due to its importance in critical application domains, such as self-driving cars, law, and healthcare. Genetic programming (GP) is a powerful evolutionary algorithm for machine learning. Compared with other standard machine learning models such as neural networks, the models evolved by GP tend to be more interpretable due to their model structure with symbolic components. However, interpretability has not been explicitly considered in GP until recently, following the surge in the popularity of XAI. This article provides a comprehensive review of the studies on GP that can potentially improve the model interpretability, both explicitly and implicitly, as a byproduct. We group the existing studies related to explainable artificial intelligence by GP into two categories. The first category considers the intrinsic interpretability, aiming to directly evolve more interpretable (and effective) models by GP. The second category focuses on post-hoc interpretability, which uses GP to explain other black-box machine learning models, or explain the models evolved by GP by simpler models such as linear models. This comprehensive survey demonstrates the strong potential of GP for improving the interpretability of machine learning models and balancing the complex tradeoff between model accuracy and interpretability.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI), such as machine learning (ML) models, is profoundly impacting an organization's ability to assess safety risks during the construction of tunnels. Yet, ML models are black boxes and suffer from interpretability and transparency issues - they are unexplainable. Hence the motivation of this paper is to address the following research question: How can we effextively explain data-driven ML model's predicitve assessment of geotechnical risks in tunnel construction? We draw on the concept of 'eXplainable AI' (XAI) and utilize causal discovery and reasoning to help analyze and interpret the manifestation of geotechnical risks in tunnel con-struction by developing: (1) a sparse nonparametric and nonlinear directed acyclic diagram (DAG) used to determine the causal structure of risks between sub-systems; (2) a multiple linear regression model, which we use to estimate the effect of the causal relationships between sub-systems; and (3) a probability-based reasoning model to quantify and reason about risk. We use the San-yang Road tunnel project in Wuhan (China) to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed approach. The results indicate that our approach can accurately explain what and how risks are obtained from a data-driven probability-based ML model for ground settlement in tunnel construction.

AB  - This study empirically compares multiple eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to interpret short-term (weekly) machine learning-based burglary predictions at the micro-place level in Ghent, Belgium. While previous research predominantly relies on SHAP to interpret spatiotemporal crime predictions, this is the first study to systematically evaluate SHAP alongside other XAI techniques, offering both global and local model interpretability within the context of crime prediction. Using data from 2014 to 2018 on residential burglary, repeat and near-repeat victimization, environmental features, socio-demographic indicators, and seasonal effects, we trained an XGBoost model with 76 features to predict weekly burglary hot spots. This model serves as a basis for comparing the interpretative power of different XAI techniques. Our results show that built environment and land use characteristics are the most consistent global predictors of burglary risk. However, their influence varies substantially at the local level, revealing the importance of spatial context. While global feature importance rankings are broadly aligned across XAI techniques, local explanations, especially between SHAP and LIME, often diverge. These discrepancies highlight the need for careful method selection when translating predictions into crime prevention strategies. In addition, this study demonstrates that short-term burglary risks are influenced by complex interactions and threshold effects between environmental and social disorganization features. We interpret these findings through the lens of criminological theory, and argue for more integrated approaches that go beyond examining the isolated effects of specific crime predictors. Finally, we call for greater attention to the methodological implications that arise from applying different interpretability techniques, particularly when machine learning model outputs are used to inform crime prevention and policy decisions.

AB  - Metal-based Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) has made fabricating intricate components easier. Yet, assessing part quality is inefficient, relying on costly Computed Tomography (CT) scans or time-consuming destructive tests. Also, intermittent inspection of layers also hampers machine productivity. The Additive Manufacturing (AM) field explores real-time quality monitoring using sensor signatures and Machine Learning (ML) to tackle this. One such approach is sensing airborne Acoustic Emissions (AE) from process zone perturbations and comprehending flaw formation for monitoring the LPBF process. This study emphasizes the importance of selecting airborne AE sensors for accurately classifying LPBF dynamics in 316 L, utilizing a flat response sensor to capture AE's during three regimes: Lack of Fusion, conduction mode, and keyhole. To comprehensively under-stand AE from a broad process space, the data was collected for two different 316 L stainless steel powder distributions (> 45 mu m and < 45 mu m) using two different parameter sets. Frequency analysis unveiled distinct LPBF dynamics as dominant and correlated in specific frequency ranges. Empirical Mode Decomposition was used to examine the periodicity of AE signals by separating them into constituent signals for comparison. Transformed AE signals were trained to distinguish regimes using ML classifiers (Convolutional Neural Networks, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machines). Sensitivity analysis using saliency maps and feature importance scores identified frequency information below 40 kHz relevant for decision-making. This study highlights interpretable machine learning's potential to identify critical frequency ranges for distinguishing LPBF regimes and underscores the importance of sensor selection for enhanced process monitoring.

AB  - Employees working on construction projects have a higher risk of experiencing occupational accidents compared to workers in other sectors. Newly employed workers might face an occupational accident shortly after they start working due to not being able to notice risky environmental conditions. Despite existing studies in construction safety literature focusing on several output variables such as fatality, accident type or accident severity predictions, no studies have examined the short-term susceptibility of construction workers to occupational injuries. This study aims to develop a model to predict construction workers' susceptibility to short-term occupational accidents using interpretable machine learning (ML) methods. Hence, the primary research objective is to identify construction workers who have high probability of experiencing an occupational accident shortly after their employment. In this respect, a national dataset of occupational accidents encountered in the construction industry in Turkey was collected and subjected to various pre-processing elements (data cleaning, data scaling, and data resampling) to prepare the data for prediction. At the processing step, Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB) algorithm was applied for the classification purpose. In the next step, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) was used as an interpretable artificial intelligence algorithm to explain how, to what extent, and in which direction the input variables affect the prediction scheme, which is another distinguishing feature of the present study compared to past studies in the subject matter. Results show that the proposed SGB model is a powerful detector for the classification problem and salary of workers, past accident in the company, and number of workers in the company were the most influencing factors. Overall, this study contributes to practice by improving the safety conditions of the newly employed workers as well as minimizing their accident probability through intensified safety training. Given that contemporary safety management applications demand a new set of data-driven inputs, proposed model is expected to help industry professionals and safety managers apply more robust safety risk mitigation and/or prevention measures.

AB  - The accurate characterization of signal propagation is critical for optimizing wireless network performance and supporting applications such as electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure assessment and the development of Radio Environmental Maps (REMs). This study proposes a novel, explainable machine learning system to predict electric field strength across diverse urban, semi-urban, and rural environments in Cyprus. The system is trained on a rich dataset comprising 6,543 EMF measurements collected in 2023 at mobile phone and digital TV stations, following CEPT/ECC/REC/(02)04 recommendations. The dataset includes geospatial and environmental features such as antenna distance, population density, urbanization level, and detailed built environment characteristics (e.g., volume, surface, and height). We evaluate multiple machine learning models-kNN, neural networks, decision trees, random forests, XGBoost, and LightGBM-using a two-semester split for training and assessment. Best performance was achieved with the Random Forest model, which yielded the lowest RMSE among all models. Gradient boosting models (XGBoost and LightGBM) also performed well, with RMSE values slightly higher than RF while offering flexible and scalable configurations. In contrast, k-NN and neural networks showed higher RMSE values, indicating they were less effective for this specific task. Across all models, confidence intervals were narrow, demonstrating stable and reliable predictions. Explainable AI techniques revealed that antenna distance, building volume, and population density are the most influential predictors of EMF intensity. Our approach outperforms traditional signal models by incorporating urban morphology and demographic context. As part of this system, we also create a Geographic Information System (GIS) that displays electromagnetic field strength maps derived from our explainable machine learning models. This contributes a scalable, interpretable framework for EMF exposure mapping to support regulatory monitoring, urban planning, and smart city initiatives.

AB  - Quality assurance (QA) plays a crucial role in manufacturing to ensure that products meet their specifications. However, manual QA processes are costly and time-consuming, thereby making artificial intelligence (AI) an attractive solution for automation and expert support. In particular, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have gained a lot of interest in visual inspection. Next to AI methods, the explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) systems, which achieve transparency and interpretability by providing insights into the decision-making process of the AI, are interesting methods for achieveing quality inspections in manufacturing processes. In this study, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to explore AI and XAI approaches for visual QA (VQA) in manufacturing. Our objective was to assess the current state of the art and identify research gaps in this context. Our findings revealed that AI-based systems predominantly focused on visual quality control (VQC) for defect detection. Research addressing VQA practices, like process optimization, predictive maintenance, or root cause analysis, are more rare. Least often cited are papers that utilize XAI methods. In conclusion, this survey emphasizes the importance and potential of AI and XAI in VQA across various industries. By integrating XAI, organizations can enhance model transparency, interpretability, and trust in AI systems. Overall, leveraging AI and XAI improves VQA practices and decision-making in industries.

AB  - Ridesharing is a crucial component in optimizing urban mobility by alleviating traffic congestion and reducing emissions. However, the ridesharing potential remains underutilized, and the distribution characteristics of this potential have yet to be well quantified. This study leverages the shareability network method and interpretable machine learning techniques, utilizing high- precision taxi trajectory data, to analyze the spatiotemporal patterns of ridesharing potential in Shanghai and to elucidate the spatiotemporal dynamics of the factors influencing it. The findings reveal that ridesharing potential is highest during evening peaks, followed by weekends, and lowest during morning peaks, which contrasts with typical residential travel patterns. The results highlight the nonlinear, spatiotemporal heterogeneity of built environment impacts on ridesharing potential, with significant variations in the importance of residential, employment, and leisure factors across different time periods. These insights provide valuable guidance for urban planners and transportation network companies in enhancing operational efficiency and effectively promoting ridesharing.

KW  - BEARING
AB  - Due to the growing interest for increasing productivity and cost reduction in industrial environment, new techniques for monitoring rotating machinery are emerging. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the approaches that has been proposed to analyze the collected data (e.g., vibration signals) providing a diagnosis of the asset's operating condition. Three major problems hinder the application of AI models in industrial environments, being the motivation for the research: (i) impossibility or long time to obtain a sample of all operational conditions (since faults rarely happen), (ii) high cost of experts to label all acquired data (in a supervised scenario) and (iii) lack of interpretability of the models (black-boxes). To overcome these problems, a new generic and interpretable approach for classifying faults in rotating machinery based on transfer learning from augmented synthetic data to real rotating machinery is here proposed, namely FaultD-XAI (Fault Diagnosis using eXplainable AI). To provide scalability using transfer learning, synthetic vibration signals are created mimicking the characteristic behavior of failures in operation. The application of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) with 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) allows the post hoc interpretation of results, supporting the user in decision making and increasing diagnostic confidence. The proposed approach not only obtained promising diagnostic performance but was also able to learn characteristics used by experts to identify conditions in a source domain and apply them in another target domain. The experimental results obtained on three datasets containing different mechanical faults suggest the method offers a promising approach on exploiting transfer learning, synthetic data and explainable artificial intelligence for fault diagnosis. Lastly, to guarantee reproducibility and foster research in the field, the developed dataset is made publicly available.

AB  - Cast-resin transformers are affected by deterioration due to manufacturing defects and continuous load. Studying PD, which is capable of detecting defects or degradation in advance, is important. With the rapid advancement of AI technologies, research on PD classification using CNN models is being actively conducted. However, due to the black box problem, it is impossible to explain the reasoning behind the learning outcomes. Therefore, relying solely on predictive outcomes of learning for PD classification raises issues of reliability. Recent studies in various fields are progressing with the application of XAI to address the black box issue of CNNs, aiming to identify the criteria used for making predictions. However, research on applying XAI in AI-based PD classification is currently insufficient. Therefore, further study on the implementation of XAI is necessary. In this paper, an excellent CNN model was applied to image classification for PD classification of cast-resin transformers, and the grad-cam model was used for XAI. This approach proposes a method for humans to comprehend the rationale behind the learning outcomes. The training data includes artificial defects created in laboratory settings and noise captured in cast-resin transformers using UHF sensors. Our research demonstrated that PD and noise due to defects can be identified with an accuracy of approximately 97%. The reasons for successful and failed results were analyzed through XAI. Consequently, it was observed that the application of XAI to CNN models leads to the construction of a more reliable model.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, such as deep learning models, are increasingly used to determine risks in construction. However, the black-box nature of AI models makes their inner workings difficult to understand and interpret. Deploying explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) can help explain why and how the output of AI models is generated. This article addresses the following research question: How can we accurately identify the critical factors influencing tunnel-induced ground settlement and provide counterfactual explanations to support risk-based decision-making? We apply an XAI approach using counterfactual explanations to help understand decision-making surrounding risks when considering control ground settlement. Our approach consists of a: 1) construction of Kernel principal components analysis-based deep neural network (DNN) model; 2) generation of counterfactual explanations; 3) analysis of risk prediction and assessment factors' importance, necessity, and sufficiency. We apply our approach to the San-yang road tunnel project in Wuhan, China. The results demonstrate that the KPCA-DNN model better predicted ground settlement based on high-dimensional input features than the baseline model (i.e., AdaBoost and RandomForest). The bubble chamber pressure -> cutter-head speed -> equipment inclination is also identified as the primary risk path. Our findings indicate that using counterfactual explanations enables transparency and trust in AI-based risk models to be acquired. Moreover, our approach can help site managers, engineers, and tunnel-boring machine operators understand how to manage better and mitigate the risk of ground settlement.

AB  - Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a standard digital process that fuses buildings information from different sources into a 3D model during their lifecycle. For new construction sites using BIM, it is possible to monitor the cost, schedule, and changes throughout the lifecycle; however, existing buildings do not have a BIM model. Manually creating the BIM models for existing buildings is a high-cost task, both in time and money, hence there is a need for extracting information from available paper-based documentation and fuse it into a BIM model. The struggle of facility management and utility companies to fully adopt a BIM process (due to their high volumes of paper-based documentation of existing buildings) has led to the research on creating these 3D BIM models from 2D floor plan images.
   This paper presents a novel processing pipeline to extract 2D digital information from floorplans, fusing it into a 3D BIM model. The work focuses on fusing the available information to create the structure of the building in BIM format, which is considered the essential step before looking on working with other sources of data. In this process, we introduce a type-2 fuzzy logic based Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) approach for the semantic segmentation step. The approach consists of using the outputs of type-2 fuzzy logic systems to classify a pixel as wall or background, by using information around and from the pixel of interest as the inputs to the system. After the semantic segmentation step, the output of the type-2 fuzzy logic goes through a noise removal process and finally a transformation from 2D to 3D by assigning the corresponding BIM tag to each identified element. The proposed type-2 fuzzy logic semantic segmentation approach produced comparable results (97.3% mean Intersection over Union (IoU) performance metric value) to the opaque box model approach based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) (99.3% mean IoU performance metric value). However, the type-2 fuzzy XAI system benefits from being an augmentable and interpretable model, which means that human users can understand the decision process and modify the model using their expert knowledge.

AB  - Vacuum insulated glazing (VIG) is a highly thermally insulating window technology, which boasts an extremely thin profile and lower weight as compared to gas-filled insulated glazing units of equivalent performance. The VIG is a double-pane configuration with a submillimeter vacuum gap maintained by small pillars positioned in between the panes, which can damage the glass during manufacturing, transportation and installation. For the purpose of automatically classifying the damage, we have developed, trained, and tested a deep learning model using convolutional neural networks. We employ the state-of-the-art methods Grad-CAM and Score-CAM of explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to provide an understanding of the internal mechanisms and were able to show that our classifier outperforms ResNet50V2 for identification of crack locations and geometry. Further analysis of our model's predictive capabilities demonstrates its superiority over state-of-the-art ResNet models in terms of convergence speed, accuracy, precision at 100% recall and AUC for ROC.

AB  - Ensuring high levels of quality and efficiency is essential for compliance with ISO standards in chemical manufacturing. Traditional methods, such as Statistical Process Control (SPC) and Six Sigma, often lack adaptability and fail to offer interpretable insights. This study proposes a hybrid quality control model based on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), integrating fuzzy C-means clustering (FCM), machine learning (ML), and Fuzzy Inference Systems (FISs) to enhance defect prediction and interpretability in industrial environments. The approach uses fuzzy clusters to segment production batches, improving the understanding of process variability. A supervised ML model (XGBoost) is trained on historical data to predict defect probabilities, while an explainable FIS refines the final assessment using expert-defined rules. XAI techniques (SHAP and LIME) offer transparency and insight into the decision-making process. Experimental validation using a real-world white wine dataset, evaluated in terms of accuracy and interpretability, shows that the proposed model outperforms traditional approaches in both predictive performance and transparency. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining unsupervised clustering, predictive analytics, and fuzzy reasoning in an Industry 4.0 framework. This study provides a scalable and adaptable solution for real-time quality control in chemical manufacturing, improving decision support systems and enabling automated and explainable quality assessments.

AB  - Understanding molecular traits through metabolomics offers an avenue to tailor cardiovascular prevention, diagnosis and treatment strategies more effectively. This study focuses on the application of machine learning (ML) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) algorithms to detect discriminant molecular signatures in heart failure (HF). We aim to uncover metabolites with significant predictive value by analyzing targeted metabolomics data through ML and XAI algorithms. After quality control, we analyzed 55 metabolites from 124 plasma samples, including 53 HF patients and 71 controls, comparing Ridge Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine and eXtreme Gradient Boosting models. All achieved high accuracy in predicting group labels: 84.0% [95% CI: 75.3 - 92.7], 85.73 [95% CI: 78.6 - 92.9], and 84.8% [95% CI: 76.1 - 93.5], respectively. Permutation-based variable importance and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) were used for group-level and individual-level explainability, respectively, complemented by H-Friedman statistics for variable interactions, yielding reliable, explainable insights of the ML models. Metabolites well-known for their association with HF, such as glucose and cholesterol, and more recently described, the C18:1 carnitine, were reaffirmed in our analysis. The novel discovery of lignoceric acid (C24:0 fatty acid) as a critical discriminator, was confirmed in a replication cohort, underscoring its potential as a metabolite marker. Furthermore, our study highlights the utility of 2 way variable interaction analysis in unveiling a network of metabolite interactions essential for accurate disease prediction. The results demonstrate our approach's efficacy in identifying key metabolites and their interactions, illustrating the power of ML and XAI in advancing personalized healthcare solutions.

AB  - Surface ozone has become a significant atmospheric pollutant in China, exerting a profound impact on crop production and posing a serious threat to food security. Previous studies have extensively explored the physiological mechanisms of ozone damage to plants. However, the effects of ozone interactions with other environmental factors, such as climate change, on agricultural productivity at the regional scale, particularly under natural conditions, remain insufficiently understood. In this study, we employed an interpretable machine learning framework, specifically the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm enhanced by SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), to investigate the influence of ozone and its interactions with environmental factors on crop production in China's primary winter wheat region. Additionally, a structural equation model was developed to elucidate the mechanisms driving these interactions. Our findings demonstrate that ozone pollution exerts a significant negative effect on winter wheat productivity (r r =-0.47, P < 0.001), with productivity losses escalating from-12.28 % to-22.09 % as ozone levels increase. Notably, the impact of ozone is spatially heterogeneous, with western Shandong province identified as a hotspot for ozone-induced damage. Furthermore, our results confirm the complexity of the relationship between ozone pollution and agricultural productivity, which is influenced by multiple interacting environmental factors. Specifically, we found that severe ozone pollution, when combined with high aerosol concentrations or elevated temperatures, significantly exacerbates crop productivity losses, although drought conditions can partially mitigate these adverse effects. Our study highlights the importance of incorporating the interactive effects of air pollution and climate change into future crop models. The comprehensive framework developed in this study, which integrates statistical modeling with explainable machine learning, provides a valuable methodological reference for quantitatively assessing the impact of air pollution on crop productivity at a regional scale.

AB  - Machine learning has increasingly found its way into the credit risk literature. When applied to forecasting credit risk parameters, the approaches have been found to outperform standard statistical models. The quantification of prediction uncertainty is typically not analyzed in the machine learning credit risk setting. However, this is vital to the interests of risk managers and regulators alike as its quantification increases the transparency and stability in risk management and reporting tasks. We fill this gap by applying the novel approach of deep evidential regression to loss given defaults (LGDs). We evaluate aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty for LGD estimation techniques and apply explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods to analyze the main drivers. We find that aleatoric uncertainty is considerably larger than epistemic uncertainty. Hence, the majority of uncertainty in LGD estimates appears to be irreducible as it stems from the data itself.

AB  - Human ideas and sentiments are mirrored in facial expressions. They give the spectator a plethora of social cues, such as the viewer's focus of attention, intention, motivation, and mood, which can help develop better interactive solutions in online platforms. This could be helpful for children while teaching them, which could help in cultivating a better interactive connect between teachers and students, since there is an increasing trend toward the online education platform due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To solve this, the authors proposed kids' emotion recognition based on visual cues in this research with a justified reasoning model of explainable AI. The authors used two datasets to work on this problem; the first is the LIRIS Children Spontaneous Facial Expression Video Database, and the second is an author-created novel dataset of emotions displayed by children aged 7 to 10. The authors identified that the LIRIS dataset has achieved only 75% accuracy, and no study has worked further on this dataset in which the authors have achieved the highest accuracy of 89.31% and, in the authors' dataset, an accuracy of 90.98%. The authors also realized that the face construction of children and adults is different, and the way children show emotions is very different and does not always follow the same way of facial expression for a specific emotion as compared with adults. Hence, the authors used 3D 468 landmark points and created two separate versions of the dataset from the original selected datasets, which are LIRIS-Mesh and Authors-Mesh. In total, all four types of datasets were used, namely LIRIS, the authors' dataset, LIRIS-Mesh, and Authors-Mesh, and a comparative analysis was performed by using seven different CNN models. The authors not only compared all dataset types used on different CNN models but also explained for every type of CNN used on every specific dataset type how test images are perceived by the deep-learning models by using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), which helps in localizing features contributing to particular emotions. The authors used three methods of XAI, namely Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and SoftGrad, which help users further establish the appropriate reason for emotion detection by knowing the contribution of its features in it.

AB  - Apple farming plays a significant role in agriculture, serving as an essential source of livelihood for farmers. However, cedar apple rust, apple scab, and black rot are common apple leaf diseases severely affecting apple yield. Early detection of these diseases is crucial for preserving quality and productivity. Researchers have used deep learning models to improve disease classification, they but lack lightweight architecture and transparency, operating as black box systems. Leveraging the power of lightweight models and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) addresses these challenges by developing transparent methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This study proposes an enhanced version of MobileNetV2, incorporating a multi-branched architecture to improve feature map representation for classification tasks. The proposed model achieved 99.18% accuracy on the benchmark plant village dataset, surpassing existing studies. The results also integrated local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) to emphasize the role of individual features in the model's predictions. The proposed model has a lightweight structure, which ensures its suitability for IoT-based real-time agricultural applications.

AB  - Decision support systems (DSS) assist in a wide array of decision-making tasks in different domains. However, one of their common drawbacks is that their working is back box in nature. This means that while they recommend a decision, they cannot explain the 'why' behind reaching that decision. In prescriptive tasks such as risk management, this does not assist the risk manager in identifying the contributing features leading to the occurrence of a risk output against which corrective action/s needs to be taken. This limitation has sparked interest in explainability, where glass-box methods interpret the contributing features leading to the recommended decision. Approaches which do that however do not model how the contributing features' evolve over a period of time, till the predicted time period, to determine the output class before interpreting the reason for the decision output. To address these gaps, in this work we propose An Automated Interpretable Artificial Intelligence framework for Proactive Risk Management (AIAI-PRM). AIAI-PRM augments Local Interpretation -Driven Abstract Bayesian Network (LINDA-BN) with Knowledge Graph to determine the inter dependencies among the features, model how they evolve over a period of time and interpret the contributing features leading to the recommended output. In the domain of risk management, we show how this knowledge can be used by the risk manager to determine those key features against which risk management strategies need to be developed. Finally, we compare the AIAI-PRM's output with that of the most commonly used XAI approaches, namely LIME and SHAP, to prove its superiority.

AB  - Algal blooms, exacerbated by climate change and eutrophication, have emerged as a global concern. In this study, we introduce a novel interpretable machine learning (ML) workflow tailored for investigating the dynamics of algal populations in grass -type lakes, Liangzi lake. Utilizing seven ML methods and incorporating the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES), we predict algal density across three distinct time periods, resulting in the construction of a total of 30 ML models. The CMA-ES-CatBoost model consistently demonstrates superior predictive accuracy and generalization capability across these periods. Through the collective validation of various interpretable tools, we identify water temperature and permanganate index as the two most critical water quality parameters (WQIs) influencing algal density in Liangzi Lake. Additionally, we quantify the independent and interactive effects of WQIs on algal density, pinpointing key thresholds and trends. Furthermore, we determine the minimum combination of WQIs that achieves near -optimal predictive performance, striking a balance between accuracy and cost-effectiveness. These findings offer a scientific and economically efficient foundation for governmental agencies to formulate strategies for water quality management and sustainable development.

AB  - A vital component of maintaining the world's expanding populace is farming. In agriculture field, factors such as soil quality, weather patterns, and crop yields are essential components of usual possessions that affect farming manufacture. Despite advancements, prevailing smart systems quiet struggle with handling big amounts in prediction claims, often facing difficulties in balancing prediction accuracy and learning efficiency. To ensure sustainable food production, integrating advanced machineries such as machine learning and artificial intelligence in agriculture is essential. This study proposes an explainable AI (XAI)-based smart agriculture system to provide holistic recommendation for precision farming aimed at improving productivity while reducing environmental impact. We compiled a comprehensive weather, soil, and crop dataset from official and verified sources in India. From this dataset, we extracted and optimized features using pre-trained architectures and enhanced barnacles mating optimization (EBMO) algorithm, addressing the high-measure mentality and computational complexity issues often encountered in agricultural data analysis. The selected features were analyzed to provide holistic recommendations for precision farming using baseline ML models such as support vector machine, random forest, neural network, and decision tree. Additionally, we integrate the XAI framework with an interpretable recommendation/s for optimizing the agricultural practices. The study developed an XAI-based smart agriculture system that provides holistic recommendations for precision farming to boost productivity. By using a comprehensive dataset and optimizing features with the EBMO algorithm, the research achieved high accuracy in crop yield predictions, particularly with the XLNet+SVM model, which outperformed existing models across various crops. The integration of SHapley Additive explanation (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation (LIME) further enabled interpretable AI-driven insights, enhancing transparency in decision-making. The results demonstrated significant improvements in prediction accuracy, resource management, and sustainability, offering valuable contributions to global food security through smart agriculture. The ability to explain these AI decisions further supports the adoption of AI technologies in agriculture, fostering resilient agricultural systems that are essential for feeding the world's growing population.

AB  - Agriculture is one of the most important sectors, as many countries' economies depend on it. At the same time, meeting the food requirements of the increasing population is also challenging, as the land for agriculture is curtailed everywhere. Thus, there is a need to increase crop productivity, and machine learning (ML) techniques are very helpful in recommending suitable crops based on soil, weather, and other parameters. This work presents a crop recommendation model based on Gradient Boosting trained on a crop recommendation dataset. The model can accurately recommend crops based on nutrients and environmental parameters. The proposed method shows promising results in agricultural crop recommendation, with a 99.27% accuracy rate, 99.32% precision, 99.36% recall, and 99.32% F1 score. This proposed model is pertinent because, further, the amalgamation of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) helps to provide detailed explanations to give agronomists a reliable and steady tool for fast and accurate recommendation of crops.

AB  - Accurate construction cost prediction is vital for project management, influencing budgeting, resource allocation, and overall success. This study proposes a comprehensive framework that combines machine learning models, uncertainty quantification through Confidence Intervals, and explainable AI techniques using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to enhance transparency and decision-making. Ten machine learning models, including Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Elastic Net, K-Nearest Neighbor Regression, and advanced ensemble methods such as XGBoost, CatBoost, and HistGradient Boosting, were evaluated on the RSMeans dataset. Among these, HistGradient Boosting achieved the best performance on the testing dataset. Beyond traditional metrics, Confidence Intervals quantified prediction reliability, and SHAP identified critical cost drivers like "Formwork" and "Tributary Area," enabling interpretable and robust prediction. This study highlights the potential of machine learning models to revolutionize construction cost estimation by integrating predictive accuracy, uncertainty analysis, and explainability. The proposed framework supports resource efficiency and enables process innovation in cost management. It also contributes to the advancement of sustainable building practices, offering a strong foundation for future research and promoting the adoption of machine learning-based solutions with enhanced transparency and confidence.

AB  - PurposeThe number of bidders in upcoming tenders has important managerial implications for both construction clients and contractors in their decision-making in the competitive bidding process. However, there is a stagnation of research efforts on predicting the number of bidders with only a handful of studies over the past decades, which mainly focused on statistical distribution of the number of bidders. This study aims to provide a new perspective of predicting the number of bidders using machine learning (ML) algorithms.Design/methodology/approachThis study adopted a case study approach with a bidding dataset of public sector construction projects in Singapore. Six ML models were developed, and linear regression was used as a baseline model is assessing the predictive performance of ML models.FindingsThe results show that ML models outperform the baseline linear regression model, in which XGBoost is the best performing model of R2 which is two times higher than the linear regression model. In addition, economic-related factors play a vital role in this prediction problem.Research limitations/implicationsWhile the predictive performance of the developed ML models is relatively low, it indicates the challenges and complexities in this prediction problem, even with the use of artificial intelligent techniques.Originality/valueBeing a pioneering work, this study sets a foundation for the use of ML models in this prediction problem and offers insights for future modelling attempts towards the development of a decision support system for construction clients and contractors.

AB  - In recent years, knowledge graphs (KGs) have been widely applied in various domains for different purposes. The semantic model of KGs can represent knowledge through a hierarchical structure based on classes of entities, their properties, and their relationships. The construction of large KGs can enable the integration of heterogeneous information sources and help Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems be more explainable and interpretable. This systematic review examines a selection of recent publications to understand how KGs are currently being used in eXplainable AI systems. To achieve this goal, we design a framework and divide the use of KGs into four categories: extracting features, extracting relationships, constructing KGs, and KG reasoning. We also identify where KGs are mostly used in eXplainable AI systems (pre-model, in-model, and post-model) according to the aforementioned categories. Based on our analysis, KGs have been mainly used in pre-model XAI for feature and relation extraction. They were also utilised for inference and reasoning in post-model XAI. We found several studies that leveraged KGs to explain the XAI models in the healthcare domain.

AB  - In this research, the multilayer perceptron (MLP), also known as error backpropagation neural networks, is made transparent and explainable by contrasting with the commonly applied multiple linear regression (MLR). A novel MLP-based method for performing global sensitivity analysis is formalized to tackle complicated, nonexplainable simulation models or artificial intelligence (AI) models, which were developed to support critical decisions in construction engineering. The sensitivity analysis results serve as further evidence to validate the decision support models and lend new insights into the problems under investigation. The proposed new method was applied in two case studies in construction engineering, they are: precast viaduct installation cycles and concrete strength development. In both applications, the results of sensitivity analysis were represented in straightforward forms and effectively cross-checked with the existing knowledge of the problem domain or the experiences of construction practitioners.

AB  - Automatic detection of tire defects has become an important issue for tire production companies since these defects cause road accidents and loss of human lives. Defects in the inner structure of the tire cannot be detected with the naked eye; thus, a radiographic image of the tire is gathered using X-ray cameras. This image is then examined by a quality control operator, and a decision is made on whether it is a defective tire or not. Among all defect types, the foreign object type is the most common and may occur anywhere in the tire. This study proposes an explainable deep learning model based on Xception and Grad-CAM approaches. This model was fine-tuned and trained on a novel real tire dataset consisting of 2303 defective tires and 49,198 non-defective. The defective tire class was augmented using a custom augmentation technique to solve the imbalance problem of the dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed model detects foreign objects with an accuracy of 99.19%, recall of 98.75%, precision of 99.34%, and f-score of 99.05%. This study provided a clear advantage over similar literature studies.

AB  - The data used for productivity modeling represents a sample of a company's performance taken at a particular time, which leads to varying model parameters and results in a variance of the predicted productivity. This research enhances the capability of the nonlinear machine learning method called Model Tree by integrating error propagation theory to determine the variance for the predicted productivity based on a relatively large dataset available for productivity analysis. The enhanced model tree is formalized and applied in modeling structural steel fabrication productivity and piping spool fabrication productivity. The enhanced model tree is preferred over artificial neural networks due to the model's capability to explain the productivity model concerning the variance of its predicted point value and the underlying reasoning logic. The enhanced model tree will potentially find its applications in construction beyond predicting labor productivity and make a further impact on implementing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in wide-ranging engineering domains.

AB  - Explainable Artificial Intelligence (xAI) plays a crucial role in enhancing our understanding of decision-making processes within black-box Machine Learning models. Our objective is to introduce various xAI methodologies, providing risk managers with accessible approaches to model interpretation. To exemplify this, we present a case study focused on mitigating surrender risk in insurance savings products. We begin by using real data from universal life policies to build logistic regression and tree-based models. Using a range of xAI techniques, we gain valuable insight into the inner workings of tree-based models. We then propose a novel supervised clustering approach that integrates Shapley values with a Kohonen neural network (KNN). The process involves three main steps: computing Shapley values from a supervised tree-based model; clustering individuals into homogeneous profiles using an unsupervised KNN; and interpreting these profiles with a supervised decision tree model. Finally, we present several key findings derived from the application of xAI techniques, which have the potential to enhance surrender risk management practices.

AB  - Due to knowledge alienation, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in tunnel construction has been greatly stunted in recent years. In order to motivate the development of techniques in tunneling works, we propose an approach that combines automated machine learning, explainable AI, and building information modeling in this paper. Considering geotechnical uncertainties from soil properties and aleatoric uncertainties from the predicting model, this approach is used to evaluate the system risk during a large-diameter tunnel excavation taking into account the two sources of uncertainties simultaneously. The geotechnical uncertainties are evaluated by the confidence interval of the mean of samples in the Monte-Carlo simulation, and the aleatoric uncertainties are evaluated by computing the prediction interval of the machine learning models. It is found that the number of Monte-Carlo samples significantly affects the evaluation of the system's reliability. Based on our results, a generalized setup with 1000 samples performs the best and is recommended considering the efficiency of computation, as well as the reliability and conservativeness of the result. This paper effectively assists with system reliability evaluation in large-diameter tunnel constructions, where the interactive and explainable AI approach largely motivates the application of AI techniques in the field of tunnel construction.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Built environment attributes (BEAs) play a significant role in influencing urban heat resilience (UHR). Previous research has examined the correlations and nonlinear relationships between BEAs and both land surface temperature (LST) and urban heat island (UHI) effects. Nevertheless, the investigation into the nonlinear effects of BEAs on UHR remains underexplored. Furthermore, the advantages of explainable machine learning in elucidating the mechanisms through which BEAs affect the urban thermal environment have been extensively validated. Consequently, taking Beijing, a highly urbanized city, as a case, we conducted an empirical study to investigate the nonlinear effects of BEAs on UHR. We first operationalized UHR as the differential in LST between extreme heat waves and normal heat days. Secondly, we constructed a set of influencing factors covering BEAs and control variables. Subsequently, by integrating the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), the nonlinear relationships between BEAs and UHR are uncovered. The results demonstrate that: 1) Nonlinear relationships between BEAs and UHR are prevalent, as well as threshold effects. 2) Greening is the key BEA affecting UHR, accounting for 22.39% in contribution, with which increase, UHR increases at an accelerating rate. 3) From the city center outward, the growth of UHR exhibits a leapfrog effect, with the growth rate in the outer ring being 2.7 times that of the inner one. 4) Interactions between BEAs impact UHR. Our findings unveil the complex nonlinear effects of BEAs on UHR, clarifying the priority and optimal quantity thresholds of BEAs. We emphasize the importance of greening and urban scale, which could support decision-making for UHR planning and precise management.

AB  - Linear construction projects, such as pipeline irrigation projects, are prone to delays and cost overruns owing to inaccurate cost and duration estimates. The research gap pertains to studies that concentrated exclusively on predicting costs or durations using backbox artificial intelligence models. Consequently, this study introduces an innovative approach that utilizes explainable artificial intelligence to forecast the conceptual cost and duration of irrigation projects simultaneously. This study analyzed data from 1,277 historical cases using factor analysis and stepwise regression to distill 25 parameters down to five key drivers. It evaluates 12 machine learning models, including multiple linear regression, artificial neural networks, and decision tree-based ensemble methods. Bayesian optimization was employed to fine-tune the performance of each algorithm. The light gradient boosting machine is identified as the most effective algorithm for cost prediction, with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 2.989 % and an Adjusted Determination Coefficient (R*2) of 0.931. For duration prediction, the extremely randomized tree model stands out, achieving a MAPE of 2.533 % and an R*2 of 0.961. The study further employs the Shapley additive explanation technique to improve the interpretability of the key drivers used for predicting both the budget and the timeline.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the most sought-after innovations in the financial industry. However, with its growing popularity, there also is the call for AI-based models to be understandable and transparent. However, understandably explaining the inner mechanism of the algorithms and their interpretation is entirely audience-dependent. The established literature fails to match the increasing number of explainable AI (XAI) methods with the different stakeholders' explainability needs. This study addresses this gap by exploring how various stakeholders within the Swiss financial industry view explainability in their respective contexts. Based on a series of interviews with practitioners within the financial industry, we provide an in-depth review and discussion of their view on the potential and limitation of current XAI techniques needed to address the different requirements for explanations.

AB  - In steel structural engineering, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are improving accuracy, efficiency, and automation. This review explores AI-driven approaches, emphasizing how AI models improve predictive capabilities, optimize performance, and reduce computational costs compared to traditional methods. Inverse Machine Learning (IML) is a major focus since it helps engineers to minimize reliance on iterative trial-and-error by allowing them to identify ideal material properties and geometric configurations depending on predefined performance targets. Unlike conventional ML models that focus mostly on forward predictions, IML helps data-driven design generation, enabling more adaptive engineering solutions. Furthermore, underlined is Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), which enhances model transparency, interpretability, and trust of AI. The paper categorizes AI applications in steel construction based on their impact on design automation, structural health monitoring, failure prediction and performance evaluation throughout research from 1990 to 2025. The review explores challenges such as data limitations, model generalization, engineering reliability, and the need for physics-informed learning while examining AI's role in bridging research and real-world structural applications. By integrating AI into structural engineering, this work supports the adoption of ML, IML, and XAI in structural analysis and design, paving the way for more reliable and interpretable engineering practices.

AB  - Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations, a key indicator of algal blooms, were estimated using the XGBoost machine learning model with 23 variables, including water quality and meteorological factors. The model performance was evaluated using three indices: root mean square error (RMSE), RMSE-observation standard deviation ratio (RSR), and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency. Nine datasets were created by averaging 1 hour data to cover time frequencies ranging from 1 hour to 1 month. The dataset with relatively high observation frequencies (1-24 h) maintained stability, with an RSR ranging between 0.61 and 0.65. However, the model's performance declined significantly for datasets with weekly and monthly intervals. The Shapley value (SHAP) analysis, an explainable artificial intelligence method, was further applied to provide a quantitative understanding of how environmental factors in the watershed impact the model's performance and is also utilized to enhance the practical applicability of the model in the field. The number of input variables for model construction increased sequentially from 1 to 23, starting from the variable with the highest SHAP value to that with the lowest. The model's performance plateaued after considering five or more variables, demonstrating that stable performance could be achieved using only a small number of variables, including relatively easily measured data collected by real-time sensors, such as pH, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity. This result highlights the practicality of employing machine learning models and real-time sensor-based measurements for effective on-site water quality management.Practitioner Points XAI quantifies the effects of environmental factors on algal bloom prediction models The effects of input variable frequency and seasonality were analyzed using XAI XAI analysis on key variables ensures cost-effective model development

AB  - The relationship between the neighborhood environment and well-being is attracting increasingly attention from researchers and policymakers, as the goal of development has shift from economy to well-being. However, existing literature predominantly adopts the utilitarian approach, understanding well-being as people's feelings about their lives and viewing the neighborhood environment as resources that benefit well-being. The Capability Approach, a novel approach that conceptualize well-being as the freedoms to do or to be and regard environment as conversion factors that influence well-being, can offer new lens by incorporating human development into these topics. This paper proposes an alternative theoretical framework: well-being is conceptualized and measured by capability; neighborhood environment affects well-being by providing spatial services, functioning as environmental conversion factors, and serving as social conversion factors. We conducted a case study of Changshu City located in eastern China, utilizing multiple resource data, applying explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), namely eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and SHapley Additive explanations (SHAP). Our findings highlight the significance of viewing the neighborhood environment as a set of conversion factors, as it provides more explanatory power than providing spatial services. Compared to conventional research based on linear relationship assumption, our results demonstrate that the effects of neighborhood environment on well-being are non-linear, characterized by threshold effects and interaction effects.

AB  - BackgroundEggshell strength is crucial for ensuring high-quality eggs, reducing breakage during handling, and meeting consumer expectations for freshness and integrity. Conventional methods of eggshell strength measurement are often destructive, time-consuming and unsuitable for large-scale applications. This study evaluated the potential of near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy combined with explainable artificial intelligence (AI) as a rapid, non-destructive method for determining eggshell strength. Various multivariate analysis techniques were explored to enhance prediction accuracy, including spectral pre-processing and variable selection methods.ResultsPrincipal component analysis and partial least squares discriminant analysis effectively classified eggs based on a threshold shell strength of 30 N. Regression models, including partial least squares regression, random forest (RF), light gradient boosting machine and K-nearest neighbors, were evaluated. Using only 14 selected variables, the RF model achieved a very good prediction performance with Rp2$$ {R}_{\mathrm{p}}<^>2 $$ of 0.83, root mean square error of prediction of 1.49 N and ratio of prediction to deviation of 2.44. The Shapley additive explanation approach provided insights into variable contributions, enhancing the model's interpretability.ConclusionThis study demonstrated that NIR spectroscopy, integrated with explainable AI, is a robust, non-destructive and environmentally sustainable approach for eggshell strength prediction. This innovative method holds significant potential for optimizing resource utilization and enhancing quality control in the egg industry. (c) 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - The imbalance in Dockless Bike Sharing (DBS) systems is a major concern for planners, causing a significant drop in utilization efficiency. However, limited research quantifies DBS usage efficiency from a supply-demand perspective, also, the understanding of the nonlinear relationship between the built environment and DBS utilization efficiency from the time dimension is lacking, leading to biased assessments and the losses of flexible and effective DBS rebalancing strategies. Therefore, this study quantifies the efficiency of DBS usage from a supplydemand perspective by calculating the average usage interval of DBS facilities within urban subzones, termed duration of stopping usage (DSU), and employs emerging eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) technology to reveal the time-varying nonlinear impact of the built environment on DSU. The results show that the relative importance of transit accessibility, land use mix entropy and road network density remains stable in the time dimension. The time non-stationarity of the nonlinear relationship between these variables and DSU is primarily manifested in dynamic shifts of thresholds. Notably, the time-varying nature of the relative importance is particularly prominent for variables related to land use facilities. Moreover, the time non-stationarity of the nonlinear relationship is more complex, manifesting not only in threshold shifts but also in changes in correlation. We also propose several spatial transfer methods for DBS facilities, offering fresh insights for crafting flexible and adaptive DBS rebalancing strategies. These findings enhance the interpretability of the inconsistent impact of the built environment on DBS utilization efficiency and provide valuable knowledge for scientific management decisions regarding DBS rebalancing.

AB  - The use of artificial intelligence (AI) is currently being discussed and evaluated across the board in research and pray tice in all industries. This paper first provides the necessary background knowledge on general AI and then elaborates the necessity of developing domain-specific AI as well as explainable AI (XAI) for the calculation and design practice in civil engineering. The role of the civil engineering domain at the interface with AI in terms of data and modeling and design philosophy is discussed. The three examples of (i) computation of Kirchhoff slabs with physics-informed neural networks, (ii) calibration of prior models for parametric bridge design from databases, and (iii) AI-assisted conceptual design of bridges illustrate the application of domain-specific machine and deep learning and XAI with special focus on concrete and bridge de. sign. In particular, physics-informed AI (piKI) represents an alternative to established numerical methods with special consideration of available simulation and experimental data and becomes explainable and comprehensible via the use of XAI. This paves the way for the use of piKI models in civil engineering as digital twins of a structure over its life cycles.

AB  - The use of deep learning (DL) has been growing in tunnel-induced ground settlement risk modeling, eliminating the necessity for extensive prior risk management knowledge. Despite the success of deploying a DL model to predict risk, challenges prevail. (1) DL requires high-quality data, which is expensive and time-consuming to prepare, and (2) DL is a "black-box," which is difficult to understand and interpret. In this instance, we address the following question in this paper: How can we accurately predict ground settlement with limited monitoring data using DL and concurrently provide effective explanations for the generated results? We propose a new DL approach combining explainable techniques to improve ground settlement risk modeling accuracy and explainability. Our approach comprises the following: (1) an interval type-2 fuzzy system to process limited data and improve its usability; (2) a novel causal-based feature selection to determine input parameters that have strong causal effects with ground settlement risk; and (3) a soft-type attention module to evaluate and allocate feature importance to inputs, guiding neural networks to concentrate on learning features in a more targeted manner. A case study is used to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its superiority in predicting ground settlement risk with a high degree of robustness. We suggest that our approach can help decision makers better understand the "how" and "what" of DL-produced outputs, improving decision making associated with managing safety in construction.

AB  - The article considers modern methods for assessing the criticality of operational risks arising from technological system failures, human errors, and organizational shortcomings. Traditional approaches, such as regression and clustering, have proven inadequate for analyzing the nonlinear and volatile nature of operational risks in the context of digital transformation. To address these challenges, an innovative approach is proposed, leveraging neural network ensembles and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) technologies. This approach enhances the accuracy and interpretability of criticality risk forecasts. The article presents the results of previous studies in which multi-layer perceptrons (DNNs) and radial basis function networks (RBFNs) were tested for managing operational risks in credit institutions. These models demonstrated high accuracy in assessing the criticality of risks associated with human errors, Informatic Technology (IT) failures, and business process disruptions. DNNs proved effective in analyzing complex data interrelationships, while RBFNs showed high performance in classifying IT incidents. Based on these results, the further development of models using neural network ensembles is proposed to improve forecast accuracy and resilience to new data. XAI methods, such as LIME and Grad-CAM, are applied to interpret model outcomes, ensuring transparency and trust in decision-making processes. The article also outlines directions for future research and practical steps for implementing the proposed approaches in operational risk management systems.

AB  - ''Black box"models created by modern machine learning techniques are typically hard to interpret. Thus, the necessity of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has grown for understanding the rationale behind those models and converting them into white boxes. Random Forest is a black box model essential in various domains due to its flexibility, ease of use, and remarkable predictive performance. One method for explaining a Random Forest is transforming it into a self-explainable Decision Tree using Forest-Based Tree (FBT) algorithm. It basically consists of three main phases, pruning, conjunction set generation, and Decision Tree construction. In this paper, we examine six state-of-the-art pruning approaches and analyze their effect on FBT performance through pruned FBT (PFBT) in order to minimize its computational complexity. This would make it appropriate for forests and datasets of any size. They are assessed on 30 datasets, and the results show that UMEP and Hybrid pruning methods can be effectively used in the pruning stage of the PFBT algorithm in terms of pruning time and predictive performance. However, the AUC-Greedy method achieves good performance with small-size datasets.

AB  - In this study, explainable machine learning techniques are applied to predict the toxicity of mussels in the Gulf of Trieste (Adriatic Sea) caused by harmful algal blooms. By analysing a newly created 28-year dataset containing records of toxic phytoplankton in mussel farming areas and diarrhetic shellfish toxins in mussels ( Mytilus galloprovincialis), we train and evaluate the performance of machine learning (ML) models to accurately predict diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) events. Based on the F1 score, the random forest model provided the best prediction of toxicity results at which the harvesting of mussels is stopped according to EU regulations. Explainability methods such as permutation importance and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) identified key species ( Dinophysis fortii and D. caudata) and environmental factors (salinity, river discharge and precipitation) as the best predictors of DSP toxins above regulatory limits. These findings are important for improving early warning systems, which until now were based solely on empirically defined alert abundances of DSP species. They provide experts, aquaculture practitioners, and authorities with additional information to make informed risk management decisions.

AB  - The metro, renowned as an environmentally friendly mode of transportation due to its low energy consumption and minimal pollution, plays a crucial role in achieving sustainable urban growth. Due to the scarcity of information in the early stages of metro construction projects and the subjectivity of cost estimation (which relies heavily on the estimator's experience), it is always difficult to guarantee the accuracy of metro construction project cost estimation. Furthermore, the existing methodological models commonly used for cost estimation do not adequately consider the interpretability of the estimation results, making it difficult to promote their application in real-world scenarios. In this paper, an interpretable machine learning method is introduced into the study of cost estimation of metro construction projects, and a maximum relevance and minimum redundancy (mRMR)-light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM)-Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) interpretable assisted investment decision-making framework is proposed. The results show that the negative impact of variable multicollinearity on model prediction is avoided by quantitatively identifying the key driving variables of costing through mRMR based on the historical data of metro construction projects and macroeconomic data. LightGBM is employed to predict the cost of metro construction projects with a mean absolute percentage error of 13.00%, surpassing the accuracy of the five baseline models. The SHAP method's introduction explains the influence of key driving variables on the model prediction response at both global and local levels, which improves the decision trust of the cost estimation of metro construction projects. The study takes into account the impact of key driving variables on the model's prediction response in a real-world context and balances the needs for estimation accuracy and variable interpretability in real-world scenarios.
   In this study, we propose a new interpretable machine learning method that helps improve the decision trust of cost estimation for metro construction projects. We use the mRMR module to identify the key driving variables for cost. Based on the LightGBM module, we accurately fit the nonlinear relationship between the cost of metro construction projects and the key variables. The SHAP algorithm is introduced to analyze the effects of the key driving variables on the prediction of the model at both global and local levels. The combined mRMR-LightGBM-SHAP model is proven to have better prediction accuracy than the traditional prediction model under the same conditions, and the SHAP response results prove the reliability of the model prediction. The study also found that the inclusion of economic environment variables plays a positive role in improving the accuracy of cost estimation for metro construction projects. The research results can be mainly used by metro investment units to quickly confirm or review the cost of metro construction projects, and they can also help government departments pay close attention to the impact of the external economic environment on the cost of metro construction.

AB  - The principle behind artificial intelligence is mimicking human intelligence in the way that it can perform tasks, recognize patterns, or predict outcomes through learning from the acquired data of various sources. Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms have been widely used in autonomous driving, recommender systems in electronic commerce and social media, fintech, natural language understanding, and question answering systems. Artificial intelligence is also gradually changing the landscape of healthcare research (Yu et al. in Biomed Eng 2:719-731, 25). The rule-based approach that relied on the curation of medical knowledge and the construction of robust decision rules had drawn significant attention in diagnosing diseases and clinical decision support since half a century ago. In recent years, machine learning algorithms such as deep learning that can account for complex interactions between features is shown to be promising in predictive modeling in healthcare (Deo in Circulation 132:1920-1930, 26). Although many of these artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms can achieve remarkably high performance, it is often difficult to be completely adopted in practical clinical environments due to the lack of explainability in some of these algorithms. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is emerging to assist in the communication of internal decisions, behavior, and actions to health care professionals. Through explaining the prediction outcomes, XAI gains the trust of the clinicians as they may learn how to apply the predictive modeling in practical situations instead of blindly following the predictions. There are still many scenarios to explore how to make XAI effective in clinical settings due to the complexity of medical knowledge.

AB  - Mango productivity suffers greatly from leaf diseases, leading to economic and food security issues. Current visual inspection methods are slow and subjective. Previous Deep-Learning (DL) solutions have shown promise but suffer from imbalanced datasets, modest generalization, and limited interpretability. To address these challenges, this study introduces the ViX-MangoEFormer, which combines convolutional kernels and self-attention to effectively diagnose multiple mango leaf conditions in both balanced and imbalanced image sets. To benchmark against ViX-MangoEFormer, we developed a stacking ensemble model (MangoNet-Stack) that utilizes five transfer learning networks as base learners. All models were trained with Grad-CAM produced pixel-level explanations. In a combined dataset of 25,530 images, ViX-MangoEFormer achieved an F1 score of 99.78% and a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 99.34%. This performance consistently outperformed individual pre-trained models and MangoNet-Stack. Additionally, data augmentation has improved the performance of every architecture compared to its non-augmented version. Cross-domain tests on morphologically similar crop leaves confirmed strong generalization. Our findings validate the effectiveness of transformer attention and XAI in mango leaf disease detection. ViX-MangoEFormer is deployed as a web application that delivers real-time predictions, probability scores, and visual rationales. The system enables growers to respond quickly and enhances large-scale smart crop health monitoring.

AB  - This study investigates the intensity of accidents by considering the lost workdays based on real data and derived the feature importance quantitatively. Occupational injuries lead to lost workdays for construction workers. The term "lost workdays " refers to a period in which workers cannot perform regular jobs because of severe physical or mental damage from occupational injuries. Many studies focusing on type analysis, accident prediction, and risk management of construction accidents, combined with the intensity and frequency of accidents, have been conducted to prevent and minimize accidents. However, the existing method for measuring the intensity of occupational accidents/injuries is a qualitative method that reflects experts' opinions, mainly using brainstorming, the Delphi method, and the analytic hierarchy process. Thus, we propose a framework that combines traditional analysis and interpretable machine learning approaches. The random forest model was trained with 11,223 injured worker samples, feature importance and frequency analysis with the chi-squared test, and local interpretable model agnostic data. According to the results of this study, optimal safety management is possible if appropriate resources are allocated. If the risk of accidents is measured with objective and quantitative data, the prevention and analysis of accidents can be more reliable, and resources can be more efficiently allocated.

AB  - Natural broadleaf forests (NBFs) are the most abundant zonal vegetation type in subtropical regions. Understanding the mechanisms influencing stand productivity in NBFs is important for developing "nature-based" solutions for climate change mitigation. However, minimal research has captured the effects of nonlinearities and feature interactions that often have nonlinear impacts on stand productivity and influencing factors. To address this research gap, we used continuous forest inventory data, and a machine learning model for stand productivity of NBFs was constructed. Subsequently, through leveraging the interpretable machine learning framework of the SHapley Additive explanation (SHAP) and partial dependence plot, we determined global and local explanations of the influencing factors of stand productivity. Our findings indicate the following: (1) The Autogluon model performed the strongest based on R2, RMSE, and rRMSE metrics. (2) The basal area (BA), neighborhood comparison of diameter at breast height (NC), and stand age (AGE) were the key influencing factors. Stand productivity increased with increasing BA and decreased with increasing NC and AGE. BA was maintained above 15 m2ha-1 and NC was maintained below 0.45, which represent favorable conditions for NBFs to maintain optimal growth. (3) SHAP interaction values were calculated to determine the effects of the five major interactions on stand productivity. Our study provides a reference for the sustainable management of NBFs, thereby highlighting the important role of forests in mitigating climate change.

AB  - Since the growing interest in surrogate modeling, there has been continuous research aimed at simulating nonlinear chemical processes using data-driven machine learning. However, the opaque nature of machine learning models, which limits their interpretability, poses a challenge for their practical application in industry. Therefore, this study aims to analyze chemical processes using Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), a concept that improves interpretability while ensuring model accuracy. While conventional sensitivity analysis of chemical processes has been limited to calculating and ranking the sensitivity indices of variables, we propose a methodology that utilizes XAI to not only perform global and local sensitivity analysis, but also examine the interactions among variables to gain physical insights from the data. For the ammonia synthesis process, which is the target process of the case study, we set the temperature of the preheater leading to the first reactor and the split ratio of the cold shot to the three reactors as process variables. By integrating Matlab and Aspen Plus, we obtained data on ammonia production and the maximum temperatures of the three reactors while systematically varying the process variables. We then trained tree-based models and performed sensitivity analysis using the SHAP technique, one of the XAI methods, on the most accurate model. The global sensitivity analysis showed that the preheater temperature had the greatest effect, and the local sensitivity analysis provided insights for defining the ranges of process variables to improve productivity and prevent overheating. By constructing alternative models for chemical processes and using XAI for sensitivity analysis, this work contributes to providing both quantitative and qualitative feedback for process optimization.

AB  - Deep-learning (DL) techniques have been proposed to solve geophysical seismic facies classification problems without introducing the subjectivity of human interpreters' decisions. However, such DL algorithms are "black boxes " by nature, and the underlying basis can be hardly interpreted. Subjectivity is therefore often introduced during the quality control process, and any interpretation of DL models can become an important source of information. To provide a such degree of interpretation and retain a higher level of human intervention, the development and application of explainable DL methods have been explored. To showcase the usefulness of such methods in the field of geoscience, we utilize a prototype-based neural network (NN) for the seismic facies classification problem. The "prototype " vectors, jointly learned to have the stereotypical qualities of a certain label, form a set of representative samples. The interpretable component thereby transforms "black boxes " into "gray boxes. " We demonstrate how prototypes can be used to explain NN methods by directly inspecting key functional components. We describe substantial explanations in three ways of examining: 1) prototypes' corresponding input-output pairs; 2) the values generated at the specific explainable layer; and 3) the numerical structure of specific shallow layers located between the interpretable latent prototype layer and an output layer. Most importantly, the series of interpretations shows how geophysical knowledge can be used to understand the actual function of the seismic facies classifier and therefore help the DL's quality control process. The method is applicable to many geoscientific classification problems when in-depth interpretations of NN classifiers are required.

AB  - PurposeThe primary objective of this research is to provide a precise interpretation of the constructed machine learning model and produce definitive summaries that can evaluate the influence of investor sentiment on the overall sales of non-fungible token (NFT) assets. To achieve this objective, the NFT hype index was constructed as well as several approaches of XAI were employed to interpret Black Box models and assess the magnitude and direction of the impact of the features used.Design/methodology/approachThe research paper involved the construction of a sentiment index termed the NFT hype index, which aims to measure the influence of market actors within the NFT industry. This index was created by analyzing written content posted by 62 high-profile individuals and opinion leaders on the social media platform Twitter. The authors collected posts from the Twitter accounts that were afterward classified by tonality with a help of natural language processing model VADER. Then the machine learning methods and XAI approaches (feature importance, permutation importance and SHAP) were applied to explain the obtained results.FindingsThe built index was subjected to rigorous analysis using the gradient boosting regressor model and explainable AI techniques, which confirmed its significant explanatory power. Remarkably, the NFT hype index exhibited a higher degree of predictive accuracy compared to the well-known sentiment indices.Practical implicationsThe NFT hype index, constructed from Twitter textual data, functions as an innovative, sentiment-based indicator for investment decision-making in the NFT market. It offers investors unique insights into the market sentiment that can be used alongside conventional financial analysis techniques to enhance risk management, portfolio optimization and overall investment outcomes within the rapidly evolving NFT ecosystem. Thus, the index plays a crucial role in facilitating well-informed, data-driven investment decisions and ensuring a competitive edge in the digital assets market.Originality/valueThe authors developed a novel index of investor interest for NFT assets (NFT hype index) based on text messages posted by market influencers and compared it to conventional sentiment indices in terms of their explanatory power. With the application of explainable AI, it was shown that sentiment indices may perform as significant predictors for NFT sales and that the NFT hype index works best among all sentiment indices considered.

AB  - Manufacturing products in multi-stage forming processes through blanking, deep-drawing and bending operations with progressive dies is one of the most economically relevant processes in the sheet metal forming industry and allows for complex geometries. In order to be able to ensure a reliable operation of the tools, manufacturers choose stroke speed conservatively, which limits the productivity and profitability. For this reason, this paper describes which productivity-limiting factors affect multi-stage forming processes and how machine learning in combination with explainable artificial intelligence methods can be used to identify and counteract productivity-limiting factors. By equipping the processes with multiple sensors, stroke rate-dependent anomalies can be detected at an early stage and countermeasures can be derived proactively, thus making the process more reliable and ensuring product quality. The methodology developed is demonstrated using two use cases which show that vibrations and friction in a progressive die are significantly reduced.

AB  - Net primary productivity (NPP) is a crucial component of the terrestrial carbon cycle and plays a crucial role in assessing ecological security. Although machine learning models have been widely used in research on ecosystem modelling, however, the performance of deep learning models with interpretability in predicting NPP are still very limited. In this study, we developed an interpretable deep learning predictive model to uncover the historical drivers and future changes of NPP in China using remote sensing data, climate data and topography. The results show that more than three quarters (88 %) of China's regional NPP have shown an increasing trend over the past 20 years, with an overall trend of 2.46 gC/m2/yr. This extensive range of dynamic processes is a nonlinear response to climatic conditions and topographic factors. The constructed convolutional neural network (CNN) model showed good predictive skill for historical NPP, and revealed that temperature is the main controlling factor, highlighting its importance in vegetation growth in China. Compared to the historical period (2001-2020), in the context of future climate change, the risk of carbon sinks decreasing in China is highly likely in the imminent near term (2021-2039), especially under high emission scenarios. These results suggest that interpretable deep learning method is a useful tool for revealing vegetation productivity drivers and estimating vegetation productivity under a nonstationary climate background.

AB  - In the hot-rolled process, the accurate hitting of strip thickness is key to production quality control. In this paper, a novel fusion strategy is proposed to address the problem that traditional thickness mechanism (TM) models and machine learning (ML) models have their own advantages and problems. A step-wise prediction framework for the fusion of mechanism and data is built by introducing the production requirements of enterprises. The construction of the framework begins with parsing the rolling mechanism and analyzing the data influence law. In order to ensure the model accuracy, the methods of model self-learning and feature engineering are individually introduced to construct TM and ML models, and they are stored in the model library. Subsequently, a kind of performance evaluation rule base is developed, based on practical applications in the industrial field. According to the order of importance of the accuracy, stability and timeliness indicators of the enterprise production requirement scheduling model, a step-wise prediction model (MCT) of ML compensation correction TM is established. In addition, considering the "black box" characteristic of ML, eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), especially the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method, is adopted to explain the prediction results of ML. Through the influence mechanism of transparent process parameters on strip thickness deviation, the key parameters are identified and the subsequent decision deployment is optimized. At the same time, the reasons for the appearance of anomalous prediction points of the model are diagnosed, and the improvement means are proposed by combining the rolling process mechanism and ML modeling. The experimental results show that compared with other traditional methods, the framework can better meet the production quality requirements and can provide a reference for practical industrial applications.

In this paper, a novel approach was proposed by integrating explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques with a convolutional neural network (CNN) and vision transformer (ViT) for effective mulberry leaf disease classification with three disease classes. Initially, in this proposed CNN-ViT model, features are extracted using a customized CNN architecture, and then the extracted features are fed into ViT for leaf disease classification in a more streamlined approach. The CNN-ViT model achieved promising results with a projection dimension of 64, utilizing 8 heads and 8 transformer layers, yielding an accuracy of 95.60% with notable precision of 94.75%, recalls of 92.40%, and F1-scores of 93.45%. The proposed method also took 0.0017 seconds to predict an individual image. The accuracy of the proposed method was comparable to that of other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods reported in the literature. Finally, Grad-CAM was utilized for detecting precise region of interest for diseased leaves, leaf spots, and leaf rust, providing interpretability and insights into the model's decision-making process. This comprehensive approach demonstrates the effectiveness of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) integration in the CNN-ViT model for mulberry leaf disease detection, paving the way for improved agricultural disease management strategies.

AB  - The ever-increasing need for energy has caused the field of industrial electrical engineering to place a greater emphasis on designs that save energy. This is done with the intention of lowering carbon emissions as well as overall consumption. Transformers, which are essential parts of power supply and distribution systems, may be designed with an energy-efficient layout, which is one of the significant aspects of this phenomenon. This study makes use of Explainable AI (XAI) to investigate power loss in transformers, describe technical factors, determine the number of transformers, and optimize economic functioning using XAI algorithms. In order to attain superior results than those obtained via the use of conventional methods, the energy-saving design approach that was created in this research makes use of IoT sensors and XAI. Experiments that were carried out on a five-star hotel in the province of Jilin revealed a 9.8 and 43.5% decrease in complete power loss for two substations, respectively, when compared to the original design. This resulted in considerable cost reductions in yearly and entire life loss energy expenses. The research provides conclusive evidence that XAI is an efficient tool for generating cost savings and energy efficiency for industrial electrical applications.

AB  - This study introduces a data-centric framework for end-to-end supply chain resilience management. With major disruptions such as pandemics profoundly affecting industries and regions, a wealth of data capturing diverse disruption scenarios has emerged. This presents an opportunity to correlate deviations in organizational operations with disruption outcomes, reducing reliance on external supplier data and alleviating associated data privacy concerns. Utilizing deep learning, survival analysis, and explainable artificial intelligence, the research represents a pioneering advancement in translating readily accessible organizational data into forecasts of disruption risks and sources, differing from traditional model-centric methodologies. The application of this framework to a real-world scenario based on a U.S. automotive manufacturer resulted in accurately predicting the time-to-survive for critical parts, with a prediction error of under 20 days for half-year-ahead shortage forecasts. Notably, the model achieved a 50% reduction in error rates for near-term and long-term predictions compared to the best-performing alternative models. Our findings underscore the framework's ability to effectively address the complexities of global supply chain disruptions and unknown-unknown uncertainties by harnessing insights gleaned from internal operational data. This accumulated knowledge enables real-time risk identification and assessment, empowering organizations to deploy timely and targeted risk mitigation strategies for enhancing overall supply chain resilience.

AB  - Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) materials are integral to various industries, from automotive and aerospace to infrastructure and construction. While FRP composite design guidelines have been established, the process of obtaining the desired strength of an FRP composite demands considerable time and resources. Despite recent advancements in Machine Learning (ML) models which are commonly used as predictive models, the inherent 'black box' nature of those models poses challenges in understanding the relationship between input design parameters and output strength of the composite. Moreover, these models do not provide tools to facilitate the designing process of the composite. The current study introduces an explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) framework that will provide understanding for the input-output relationships of the model through SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs). In addition, the framework provides for the first time a designing approach for adjusting the important design parameters to obtain the desired composite strength by the designer through utilizing an explainability technique called Counterfactual (CF). The framework is evaluated through the design of a 14-ply composite, successfully identifying critical design parameters, and specifying necessary adjustments to meet strength requirements.

AB  - In the context of global warming, tropical cyclones (TCs) have garnered significant attention as one of the most severe natural disasters in China, particularly in terms of assessing the disaster losses. This study aims to evaluate the TC disaster loss (TCDL) using machine learning (ML) algorithms and identify the impact of specific feature factors on the prediction of model with an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) approach, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). The results show that LightGBM outperforms Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes (NB) for estimating the TCDL grades, achieving the highest accuracy value of 0.86. According to the SHAP values, the three most important factors in the LightGBM classifier model are proportion of stations with rainfall exceeding 50 mm (ProRain), maximum wind speed (MaxWind), and maximum daily rainfall (MaxRain). Specifically, in the estimation of high TCDL grade, events characterized with MaxWind exceeding 30 m/s, MaxRain exceeding 200 mm, and ProRain exceeding 30% tend to exhibit a higher susceptibility to TC disaster due to positive SHAP values. This study offers a valuable tool for decision-makers to develop scientific strategies in the risk management of TC disaster.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, including deep learning and rule-based approaches, often function as black boxes, limiting transparency and increasing uncertainty in decisions. This study addresses spurious correlations, defined as associations between patterns and classes that do not reflect causal relationships, affecting AI models' reliability and applicability. In Natural Language Processing (NLP), these correlations lead to inaccurate predictions, biases, and challenges in model generalization. We propose a method that employs Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to detect spurious patterns in textual datasets for binary classification tasks. The method applies the K-means algorithm to cluster patterns and interprets them based on their distance from centroids. It hypothesizes that patterns farther from the centroids are more likely to be spurious than those closer to them. We apply the method to public procurement datasets from the Court of Auditors of Piau & iacute; (TCE-PI) using models based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression with text representations from TFIDF and Word Embeddings, as well as a BERT model. The analysis is extended to the IMDB movie review dataset to evaluate generalizability. The results support the hypothesis that patterns farther from centroids exhibit higher spuriousness potential and demonstrate the clustering's consistency across models and datasets. The method operates independently of the techniques used in its stages, enabling the automatic detection and quantification of spurious patterns without prior human intervention.

AB  - Study Region: In the Yangtze River basin of China. Study focus: The emerging Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods provide us an opportunity to understand the nonlinear relationship that the Deep Learning(DL) model learned inside. The construction of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) has successfully minimized the likelihood of flooding in the Yangtze River basin. The XAI methods can help us to know the nonlinear relationship behind it. We apply the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network, in conjunction with two XAI methods, SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) and Expected Gradient (EG), to do our work.In our DL model, we use YiChang (YC) station runoff,Precipitation (Pre) and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) data from the middle and lower river basin as input, while the output of the model generates runoff data at the DaTong (DT) station, XAI methods enable us to calculate the significance of each input feature is for generating the output feature in a DL model. In this study, we examine the difference in importance scores between the Before Three Gorges Dam (BTGD) period and the After Three Gorges Dam (ATGD) period. New Hydrological Insights for the Region: In the BTGD period, YC runoff was the primary contributor to flooding at the DT station. However, in the ATGD period, the largest contribution to flooding in the middle and lower Yangtze River basin has shifted from YC runoff to the the middle and lower reaches of precipitation. Our results suggest that the XAI can show the nonlinear relationship between the TGD and downstream flood clearly and the TGD can effectively mitigate flooding in the middle and lower river basins by regulating runoff from the upper river basin. The work shows the potential of XAI to explain the nonlinear relationship in the hydrology field.

AB  - Machine learning algorithms have shown promise in reducing bias in wind gust predictions, while still under-predicting high gusts. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) supports this issue by identifying when predictions are reliable or need cautious interpretation. Using data from 61 extratropical storms in the Northeastern USA, we introduce evidential neural network (ENN) as a novel approach for UQ in gust predictions, leveraging atmospheric variables from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Explainable AI techniques suggested that key predictive features contributed to higher uncertainty, which correlated strongly with storm intensity and spatial gust gradients. Compared to WRF, ENN demonstrated a 47 % reduction in RMSE and allowed the construction of gust prediction intervals without an ensemble, successfully capturing at least 95 % of observed gusts at 179 out of 266 stations. From an operational perspective, providing gust forecasts with quantified uncertainty enhances stakeholders' confidence in risk assessment and response planning for extreme gust events.

AB  - The furniture manufacturing sector faces significant challenges in machining composite materials, where quality issues such as delamination can lead to substandard products. This study aims to improve the classification of drilled holes in melamine-faced chipboard using Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to better understand and interpret Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models' decisions. We evaluated three CNN architectures (VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet101) pretrained on the ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned on our dataset of drilled holes. The data consisted of 8526 images, divided into three categories (Green, Yellow, Red) based on the drill's condition. We used 5-fold cross-validation for model evaluation and applied LIME and Grad-CAM as XAI techniques to interpret the model decisions. The VGG19 model achieved the highest accuracy of 67.03% and the lowest critical error rate among the evaluated models. LIME and Grad-CAM provided complementary insights into the decision-making process of the model, emphasizing the significance of certain features and regions in the images that influenced the classifications. The integration of XAI techniques with CNN models significantly enhances the interpretability and reliability of automated systems for tool condition monitoring in the wood industry. The VGG19 model, combined with LIME and Grad-CAM, offers a robust solution for classifying drilled holes, ensuring better quality control in manufacturing processes.

AB  - Accurate crop yield prediction is vital towards optimizing agricultural productivity. Machine Learning (ML) has shown promise in this field; however, its application to legume crops, especially to lupin, remains limited, while many models lack interpretability, hindering real-world adoption. To bridge this literature gap, an interpretable ML framework was developed for predicting lupin yield using Sentinel-2 remote sensing data integrated with georeferenced yield measurements. Data preprocessing involved computing vegetation indices, removing outliers, addressing multicollinearity, normalizing feature scales, and applying data augmentation techniques to correct target imbalance. Subsequently, six ML models were evaluated representing different algorithmic strategies. Among them, XGBoost showed the best performance (R2 = 0.8756) and low error values across MAE, MSE, and RMSE metrics. To enhance model transparency, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values were applied to interpret the feature contributions of the XGBoost model. The Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were found to be key predictors of crop yield, both showing a positive correlation with higher values reflecting greater vegetation vigor and corresponding to increased yield. These were followed by B03 (green) and B12 (short-wave infrared), which captured key reflectance properties associated with chlorophyll activity and water content, respectively. Both of them substantially influence photosynthetic efficiency and plant health, ultimately affecting yield potential.

AB  - The construction industry is one of the most hazardous sectors worldwide, with extremely high rates of occupational deaths and injuries. Worker fatigue, caused by undertaking physically demanding tasks in awkward working postures over prolonged daily durations, has been recognized as the main cause of these accidents. Additionally, fatigue can lead to reduced work efficiency and increased absenteeism, undermining labor productivity. This study aims to develop an accurate and reliable model to estimate the fatigue levels of construction workers. Field studies were conducted with 156 construction workers at four construction sites in mainland China. A series of physiological, personal, work-related, and environmental factors were measured and monitored to establish an interpretable machine learning model for assessing fatigue levels. The developed interpretable machine learning model exhibited good fitting with high accuracy, evidenced by the random forest model attaining an R2 value of 0.9953 through the 10-fold cross-validation method. Furthermore, this model could transparently reveal the mechanisms underlying the prediction of worker fatigue. Work duration, work session (i.e., morning session, afternoon session), environmental parameters (i.e., air temperature, humidity, wind velocity, and radiation), and worker age were identified as key factors affecting the fatigue of construction workers. The developed fatigue model can prevent excessive fatigue among construction workers, and the model interpretation results may benefit the industry by making solid guidelines and practice notes to alleviate worker fatigue.

AB  - In this study, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques were applied to identify the most important factors influencing crop yield prediction, with a focus on strategies for sustainable agriculture. Using permutation importance and residual plot analysis, the results showed that nitrogen (N) content, Bandera variety and potassium oxide (K2O) are the most important traits influencing yield prediction. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) was used to predict yield using a large Moroccan national cereal dataset spanning 3 seasons. Residual Plots Analysis, Partial Dependent Plots (PDP), Permutation Importance (PI) and SHapley Additive ExPlanations (SHap) were used to select the features that influence yield prediction. The results indicate that optimizing soil nitrogen and potassium oxide levels together with strategic selection of crop varieties can significantly increase productivity. Residual analysis of the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) model confirmed its high predictive accuracy. This study underlines the value of XAI methods in improving the interpretability of predictive models. The insights gained can contribute to better soil management and informed crop selection, ultimately reducing yield losses under environmental stress. By increasing the resilience of agricultural systems, we aim to contribute to sustainable and data-driven farming practices and, in particular, address some of Morocco's unique agricultural challenges.

AB  - Background: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based medical devices and digital health technologies, including medical sensors, wearable health trackers, telemedicine, mobile health (mHealth), large language models (LLMs), and digital care twins (DCTs), significantly influence the process of clinical decision support systems (CDSS) in healthcare and medical applications. However, given the complexity of medical decisions, it is crucial that results generated by AI tools not only be correct but also carefully evaluated, understandable, and explainable to endusers, especially clinicians. The lack of interpretability in communicating AI clinical decisions can lead to mistrust among decision-makers and a reluctance to use these technologies. Objective: This paper systematically reviews the processes and challenges associated with interpretable machine learning (IML) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) within the healthcare and medical domains. Its main goals are to examine the processes of IML and XAI, their related methods, applications, and the implementation challenges they pose in digital health interventions (DHIs), particularly from a quality control perspective, to help understand and improve communication between AI systems and clinicians. The IML process is categorized into pre-processing interpretability, interpretable modeling, and post-processing interpretability. This paper aims to foster a comprehensive understanding of the significance of a robust interpretability approach in clinical decision support systems (CDSS) by reviewing related experimental results. The goal is to provide future researchers with insights for creating clinician-AI tools that are more communicable in healthcare decision support systems and offer a deeper understanding of their challenges. Methods: Our research questions, eligibility criteria, and primary goals were proved using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline and the PICO (population, intervention, control, and outcomes) method. We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases using sensitive and specific search strings. Subsequently, duplicate papers were removed using EndNote and Covidence. A two-phase selection process was then carried out on Covidence, starting with screening by title and abstract, followed by a full-text appraisal. The Meta Quality Appraisal Tool (MetaQAT) was used to assess the quality and risk of bias. Finally, a standardized data extraction tool was employed for reliable data mining. Results: The searches yielded 2,241 records, from which 555 duplicate papers were removed. During the title and abstract screening step, 958 papers were excluded, and the full-text review step excluded 482 studies. Subsequently, in quality and risk of bias assessment, 172 papers were removed. 74 publications were selected for data extraction, which formed 10 insightful reviews and 64 related experimental studies. Conclusion: The paper provides general definitions of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in the medical domain and introduces a framework for interpretability in clinical decision support systems structured across three levels. It explores XAI-related health applications within each tier of this framework, underpinned by a review of related experimental findings. Furthermore, the paper engages in a detailed discussion of quality assessment tools for evaluating XAI in intelligent health systems. It also presents a step-by-step roadmap for implementing XAI in clinical settings.
   To direct future research toward bridging current gaps, the paper examines the importance of XAI models from various angles and acknowledges their limitations.

AB  - South Korea's Particulate Matter (PM) concentration is among the highest among Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) member countries. However, many studies in South Korea primarily focus on housing characteristics and the physical built environment when estimating apartment prices, often neglecting environmental factors. This study investigated factors influencing apartment prices using transaction data for Seoul apartments provided by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport (MOLIT) in 2019. For this purpose, the study compared and analyzed a traditional hedonic price model with a machine learning-based random forest model. The main findings are as follows: First, the evaluation results of the traditional hedonic price model and the machine learning-based random forest model indicated that the random forest model was found to be more suitable for predicting apartment prices. Second, an importance analysis using Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) showed that PM is more important in determining apartment prices than access to education and bus stops, which were considered in this study. Finally, the study found that areas with higher concentrations of PM tend to have higher apartment prices. Therefore, when proposing policies to stabilize apartment prices, it is essential to consider environmental factors. Furthermore, it is necessary to devise measures such as assigning PM labels to apartments during the home purchasing process, enabling buyers to consider PM and obtain relevant information accordingly.

AB  - The relationship between green spaces and active travel has been extensively studied. However, the majority of previous studies relied on small datasets concerning active travel and inadequately explored non-linear and/or synergistic effects. This study uses multi-source data and interpretable machine learning techniques to identify the non-linear and synergistic effects of green spaces in Chengdu (China) on two types of active travel: cycling and running. Crowdsourced data from Strava collected in December 2021 is used to measure city-wide active travel levels. Meanwhile, green spaces are evaluated from two viewpoints: overhead view and eye level, with the latter assessed using Baidu Street View imagery. The findings demonstrate that green spaces can account for up to 20% of the variance in active travel. Generally, the effect of the area of green spaces on active travel is positive. When the area of green spaces reaches a certain threshold, its effect becomes marginal and even negative. The green view index displays complex effects on cycling. Furthermore, this study identifies synergistic effects among predictors (e.g., green view index & river line length).

AB  - Advances on the construction front continue to rise as the next industrial revolution (Construction 4.0) nears. One promising front revolves around additively fabricated or simply 3D printed concrete. The growing number of ongoing parallel research programs has now made it possible to collect a large amount of data on such concrete as, up to this point, the open literature lacks a comprehensive database. Thus, this paper presents the largest database spanning over 300 experiments on 3D printed concrete. This database is then examined via multilinear regression as well as two explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) algorithms, namely, Random Forest and XGBoost, to arrive at a working model capable of predicting the compressive strength property for 3D concrete mixtures that incorporate the following seven features: age of specimens, as well as the magnitude of cement, water, fly ash, silica fume, fine aggregate, and superplasticizer. Findings from this work infer the superiority of XAI models in predicting the strength property of 3D printed concrete. Our analysis identifies two features, namely, the age of specimens and the quantity of fine aggregate, as the most important features that can accurately predict the compressive strength property. Finally, the deployed explainability methods successfully quantified the highly nonlinear relations between the selected features and compressive strength, and this newly acquired knowledge can help tailor functional concrete mixtures.

AB  - If a product deviates from its desired properties in the injection moulding process, its root cause analysis can be aided by models that relate the input machine settings with the output quality characteristics. The machine learning models tested in the quality prediction are mostly black boxes; therefore, no direct explanation of their prognosis is given, which restricts their applicability in the quality control. The previously attempted explainability methods are either restricted to tree-based algorithms only or do not emphasize on the fact that some explainability methods can lead to wrong root cause identification of a product's deviation from its desired properties. This study first shows that the interactions among the multiple input machine settings do exist in real experimental data collected as per a central composite design. Then, the model-agnostic explainable AI methods are compared for the first time to show that different explainability methods indeed lead to different feature impact analysis in injection moulding. Moreover, it is shown that the better feature attribution translates to the correct cause identification and actionable insights for the injection moulding process. Being model agnostic, explanations on both random forest and multilayer perceptron are performed for the cause analysis, as both models have the mean absolute percentage error of less than 0.05% on the experimental dataset.

AB  - In this work, we provide some insights and develop some ideas, with few technical details, about the role of explanations in Data Quality in the context of data-based machine learning models (ML). In this direction, there are, as expected, roles for causality, and explainable artificial intelligence. The latter area not only sheds light on the models, but also on the data that support model construction. There is also room for defining, identifying, and explaining errors in data, in particular, in ML, and also for suggesting repair actions. More generally, explanations can be used as a basis for defining dirty data in the context of ML, and measuring or quantifying them. We think dirtiness as relative to the ML task at hand, e.g., classification.

AB  - In response to socioeconomic development, the number of machine learning applications has increased, along with the calls for algorithmic transparency and further sustainability in terms of energy efficient technologies. Modern computer algorithms that process large amounts of information, particularly artificial intelligence methods and their workhorse machine learning, can be used to promote and support sustainability; however, they consume a lot of energy themselves. This work focuses and interconnects two key aspects of artificial intelligence regarding the transparency and sustainability of model development. We identify frameworks for measuring carbon emissions from Python algorithms and evaluate energy consumption during model development. Additionally, we test the impact of explainability on algorithmic energy consumption during model optimization, particularly for applications in health and, to expand the scope and achieve a widespread use, civil engineering and computer vision. Specifically, we present three different models of classification, regression and object-based detection for the scenarios of cancer classification, building energy, and image detection, each integrated with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) or feature reduction. This work can serve as a guide for selecting a tool to measure and scrutinize algorithmic energy consumption and raise awareness of emission-based model optimization by highlighting the sustainability of XAI.

AB  - Predictive modeling in healthcare continues to be an active actuarial research topic as more insurance companies aim to maximize the potential of Machine Learning (ML) approaches to increase their productivity and efficiency. In this paper, the authors deployed three regression-based ensemble ML models that combine variations of decision trees through Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Gradient-boosting Machine (GBM), and Random Forest (RF) methods in predicting medical insurance costs. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAi) methods SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots were deployed to discover and explain the key determinant factors that influence medical insurance premium prices in the dataset. The dataset used comprised 986 records and is publicly available in the KAGGLE repository. The models were evaluated using four performance evaluation metrics, including R-squared (R2), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The results show that all models produced impressive outcomes; however, the XGBoost model achieved a better overall performance although it also expanded more computational resources, while the RF model recorded a lesser prediction error and consumed far fewer computing resources than the XGBoost model. Furthermore, we compared the outcome of both XAi methods in identifying the key determinant features that influenced the PremiumPrices for each model and whereas both XAi methods produced similar outcomes, we found that the ICE plots showed in more detail the interactions between each variable than the SHAP analysis which seemed to be more high-level. It is the aim of the authors that the contributions of this study will help policymakers, insurers, and potential medical insurance buyers in their decision-making process for selecting the right policies that meet their specific needs.

AB  - The agricultural sector is pivotal to food security and economic stability worldwide. Corn holds particular significance in the global food industry, especially in developing countries where agriculture is a cornerstone of the economy. However, corn crops are vulnerable to various diseases that can significantly reduce yields. Early detection and precise classification of these diseases are crucial to prevent damage and ensure high crop productivity. This study leverages the VGG16 deep learning (DL) model to classify corn leaves into four categories: healthy, blight, gray spot, and common rust. Despite the efficacy of DL models, they often face challenges related to the explainability of their decision-making processes. To address this, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) is employed to enhance the model's transparency by generating intuitive and human-readable heat maps of input images. The proposed VGG16 model, augmented with LRP, outperformed previous state-of-the-art models in classifying corn leaf diseases. Simulation results demonstrated that the model not only achieved high accuracy but also provided interpretable results, highlighting critical regions in the images used for classification. By generating human-readable explanations, this approach ensures greater transparency and reliability in model performance, aiding farmers in improving their crop yields.

AB  - Biomass pyrolysis is a complex process, quite challenging to model physically and Modern AI methods could improve its prediction and characterization. However, AI model construction requires high-quality datasets. Existing datasets in literature, usually only a few hundred records, are inadequate for robust AI applications. A first goal of the study was to make best use of the currently available body of experimental data on fixed bed non-catalytic biomass pyrolysis by comprehensively compiling available data from nearly 160 sources into a new dataset of 1137 records. Each record was carefully standardized to overcome inconsistencies in terminology and lack of uniformity among different sources. This extended dataset (including biomass properties, pyrolysis operating conditions, and bioliquid yield), integrating previous ones, is intended to promote community-based data sharing. The compiled dataset was characterized by remarkable data sparsity, due to lack of completeness of the original data. A second goal was benchmarking different regression and data imputation models to assess the predictive ability of ML applied to the collected dataset. The most accurate estimates were obtained by leveraging a subset of about 500 instances without missing values, resulting in a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.28. Application of ML to the entire dataset with imputed missing data yielded a less accurate estimate (MAE = 3.45), a feature that underlines the criticality of missing data imputation, and of the sparsity of the dataset. A third and mostly relevant goal was the critical assessment of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques that come into play when ML is aimed at evaluating the importance and directional trends of selected features. XAI tools, namely Partial Dependence Plots (PDP) and SHAP, have been applied to the dataset to assess their trustworthiness to support mechanistic inference of the importance and directional trends of key biomass properties and process operational parameters on pyrolysis yields. The result of this analysis is far from satisfactory. Significant discrepancies across studies, inconsistencies among different methods and somewhat erratic trends in PDP plots reflect the challenge in achieving consistent mechanistic insights from purely data-driven approaches, suggesting the adoption of physics-informed machine learning embodying physico-chemical relationships to improved Explainable AI.

AB  - Cyber-physical systems (CPS) security is critical, particularly with the advent of Industry 5.0, which seeks to revolutionize industrial ecosystems through enhanced automation, connectivity, and human-machine collaboration. While this shift promises increased efficiency and productivity, it exposes systems to advanced cyber threats. This paper introduces Cyber-Sentinet, a Deep Learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) designed explicitly for CPS in industrial IoT environments to address these challenges. Unlike traditional IDS models, Cyber-Sentinet integrates Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to enhance the interpretability of its decisionmaking process, allowing security experts to understand better and trust the system's detections. Rigorous experimentation on the Edge-IIoT-2022 dataset, which covers various cyberattacks (e.g., DDoS, SQL injection, MITM), validates Cyber-Sentinet effectiveness. The model achieves an accuracy of 97.46 %, precision of 97.7 %, and recall of 97.2 %, with a low loss of 0.182. These results demonstrate Cyber-Sentinet ability to offer high-performance intrusion detection and valuable insights into network security, making it a robust solution for protecting Industry 5.0 CPS against sophisticated cyber threats.

AB  - Credit scoring has become an important risk management tool for money lending institutions. Over the years, statistical and classical machine learning models have been the most researched risk management tools in credit scoring literature, and recently the focus has turned to deep learning models. This transition is due to better performances that are shown by deep learning models in different domains. Despite deep learning models' superior performances, there is still a need for explaining how these models make their predictions. The non-transparency nature of deep learning models has created a bottleneck for their use in credit scoring. Explanations of decisions are important for lending institutions since it is a requirement for automated decisions that are generated by non-transparent models to be explained. The other issue in using deep learning models, specifically 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), in credit scoring is the need to have the data in image format. We propose an explainable deep learning model for credit scoring which can harness the performance benefits offered by deep learning and yet comply with the legislation requirements for the automated decision-making processes. The proposed method converts tabular datasets into images and thus allowing the application of 2D CNNs in credit scoring. Each pixel of the image corresponds to a feature bin of the tabular dataset. The predictions from the 2D CNNs were explained using state-of-the-art explanation methods. Furthermore, explanations were evaluated using a sanity check methodology and also performances of the explanation methods were compared quantitatively. The proposed explainable deep learning model outperforms the other credit scoring methods on publicly available credit scoring datasets.

AB  - The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) in smart factories enhances management through real-time monitoring and data analytics, while Artificial Intelligence (AI) automates processes and boosts efficiency. However, AI systems require vast amounts of data and substantial training time, facing challenges such as domain discrepancies, limited labeled data, negative transfer, sample selection bias, and computational complexity. Additionally, the opaque nature of AI models raises transparency issues, making it difficult for human operators to trust and interpret AI decisions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an IoT-based safety management scheme for smart factories, utilizing advanced technologies to enhance safety and operational efficiency. The proposed approach integrates robust deep learning (DL) models developed through big transfer learning (BiTL) and is augmented with explainable AI (XAI) to ensure transparency and reliability in safety management. The major contributions of this work include designing a comprehensive IoT-based safety framework, conducting a detailed case study to optimize DL model performance using BiTL, and establishing an experimental environment for thorough validation. The findings demonstrate that the proposed system not only meets but also exceeds the performance of existing safety management solutions, offering a transparent, trustworthy, and highly effective AI-driven safety management system for modern smart factories.

AB  - Recent research has revealed that using machine learning systems for the analysis of genetic data could reliably detect Alzheimer's disease. The interpretability of these models, however, has been a challenge, as they frequently provided little insight into the features that contribute to their predictions. Explainable machine learning has been presented as a solution to this problem since it enables the identification of significant attributes and gives a clearer method of making predictions. In this study, Genome-Wide Association Studies were used to recognize genetic variants associated with Alzheimer's disease, utilizing the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset and quality control methods to ensure the validity and reliability of the findings. The results indicate strong connections between certain genetic variations and Alzheimer's disease, highlighting the potential of Genome-Wide Association Studies as a valuable tool for identifying and predicting this disease. After studying and analyzing the genetic data, machine learning algorithms are utilized to train a model to detect Alzheimer. The Support Vector Machine achieved 89% accuracy as the best-performing model. Explainable machine learning has the potential to increase the accuracy and interpretability of Alzheimer's disease detection models, giving significant insights for both academics and physicians. The explanation of the support vector machine model reveals that rs4821510 is the most important SNP in detecting AD. On top of that, the SHAP method shows that rs429358 is an indication for Alzheimer's disease and rs4821510 presents in the healthy ones. These findings suggest that explainable machine learning can play an important role in accurately detecting Alzheimer's disease and identifying critical genetic markers associated with the disease.

AB  - Complete surgical cytoreduction (R0 resection) is the single most important prognosticator in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) could clarify the influence of static and real-time features in the R0 resection prediction. We aimed to develop an AI-based predictive model for the R0 resection outcome, apply a methodology to explain the prediction, and evaluate the interpretability by analysing feature interactions. The retrospective cohort finally assessed 571 consecutive advanced-stage EOC patients who underwent cytoreductive surgery. An eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm was employed to develop the predictive model including mostly patient- and surgery-specific variables. The Shapley Additive explanations (SHAP) framework was used to provide global and local explainability for the predictive model. The XGBoost accurately predicted R0 resection (area under curve [AUC] = 0.866; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.8-0.93). We identified "turning points" that increased the probability of complete cytoreduction including Intraoperative Mapping of Ovarian Cancer Score and Peritoneal Carcinomatosis Index < 4 and <5, respectively, followed by Surgical Complexity Score > 4, patient's age < 60 years, and largest tumour bulk < 5 cm in a surgical environment of optimized infrastructural support. We demonstrated high model accuracy for the R0 resection prediction in EOC patients and provided novel global and local feature explainability that can be used for quality control and internal audit.

AB  - Feature engineering and data-driven classification models are at the forefront of analysis of large temporal sensor data from the built environment. In previous efforts, temporal features were engineered from the whole building hourly electrical meter data from 507 non-residential buildings. These features fall within the three general categories of statistics, model, and pattern-based and can be used to identify various behavior in the structure of the whole building electrical meter data. In this paper, a deeper investigation is made of exactly what types of behavior are most important in the context of two classification scenarios: the primary use of a building and the level of performance the building has when compared to its peers. The highly comparative time-series analysis (hctsa) toolkit is used to analyze the most important temporal features for the classification of various building performance attributes. In the first analysis, a comparison is made to distinguish the behavior between university dormitories (70 buildings) and laboratories (95 buildings) as an example of interpreting the classification of the primary-use-type of a building. In the second analysis, a comparison of buildings with high (165 buildings) versus low (169 buildings) consumption is used to extract and understand the behavior that indicates the level of the energy performance of a building. These two case study examples provide a foundation for further explainable machine learning techniques in both classification and prediction as applied to buildings. This effort is the first example of machine learning with an explicit focus on the interpretability of classification for smart meter data from non-residential buildings. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Raman spectroscopy has become an indispensable analytical technique in pharmaceutical research, offering non-invasive, rapid, and chemically specific insights into pharmaceutical compounds. In this study, we present a comprehensive benchmark of machine learning models for classifying 32 pharmaceutical compounds based on their Raman spectral signatures. A diverse array of algorithms-including Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forests, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM), and 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)-were evaluated on a publicly available dataset. The results demonstrate outstanding classification performance across models, with linear SVM achieving the highest accuracy of 99.88%, followed closely by CNN (99.26%). Ensemble methods such as Random Forest and XGBoost also yielded high accuracies above 98.3%. In addition to strong predictive performance, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis was employed to interpret model decisions. CNN models, in particular, revealed well-localized and chemically meaningful spectral regions critical to classification. This combination of high accuracy and interpretability highlights the promise of explainable AI in pharmaceutical analysis and quality control, offering robust, transparent, and scalable solutions for real-world applications.

AB  - Scientific and accurate assessment of risk influencing factors are crucial for flood risk management. This paper aims to propose a new comprehensive framework for flood risk assessment in coastal cities. Firstly, considering the flood characteristics of coastal cities and the impact of floods on urban spatial structure, a flood risk assessment indicator system for coastal cities was established. Secondly, combining game combination weighting and Iterative self-organizing data analysis technique algorithm (GCW_ISODATA) for flood risk assessment. Finally, based on the explainable machine learning techniques, the sensitivity of indicators to flood risk was analyzed. The results indicated that coastal floods are more destructive than rainfall and river floods. Moreover, the indicator weighting and threshold division have a direct impact on the rationality of flood risk, GCW_ISODATA method performs well in Accuracy, F1 score, and AUC, especially with the highest AUC among all methods. Entropy weight method and GCW are significantly superior to Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method, and ISODATA method usually performs better than the K-Means and Natural Break method. Furthermore, the sensitivity of indicators to flood risk reveals that differences in economic, social, and environmental characteristics across regions affect the actual impact of these indicators, leading to the sensitivity of the same indicator to flood risk varies significantly across different regions. It is expected that the framework proposed in this study can be used to explore flood risk impact on other coastal cities.

AB  - This study examines the relationship between multidimensional street-level built environment (SBE) features and urban vitality, as measured by the floating population (FP) in Seoul, South Korea. We employ deep learning (DL), machine learning (ML), and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-alongside street view imagery (SVI) and GPS mobility data (GMD). The regression results indicate that pedestrian infrastructure, urban density, street liveliness, and street furniture positively contribute to urban vitality, whereas green infrastructure and open space exhibit negative associations. Beyond previous research, this study reveals nonlinear and threshold effects: for instance, green spaces initially enhance FP but exhibit diminishing returns, while open spaces display a Ushaped relationship, contributing positively at lower levels but decreasing within a mid-range interval. This study also confirms interaction effects between SBE on urban vitality; for instance, pedestrian infrastructure most strongly promotes FP in areas with low to moderate urban density. Our contributions can be categorized into two key areas: (1) expanding urban vitality theory with empirical evidence and (2) refining the role of built environment features through a non-linear and interactive lens.

AB  - Pedestrian crashes represent a critical traffic safety issue, often resulting in fatal outcomes and raising significant equity concerns. This study analyzed detailed records of pedestrian-involved crashes in California from 2018 to 2021, employing a novel clustering framework enhanced by the SHapley Additive exPlanations approach. The proposed method significantly enhanced interpretability by effectively capturing complex non-linear relationships and interactions among features. The results indicate that impairment status and lighting conditions are pivotal in severe crash outcomes, while broader societal and demographic factors are more substantially associated with less severe cases. Non-injury pedestrian crashes tend to occur in less underserved, more resilient communities, whereas fatal crashes are more common in underserved communities with poor lighting and incomplete pedestrian infrastructure, particularly when pedestrians are under the influence of drugs or alcohol. The findings underscore the necessity for developing comprehensive safety measures that not only address situational risks but also consider broader societal conditions.

AB  - Finding a reliable and cost-effective approach to monitor the activities of the New Austrian Tunneling Method (NATM) tunnel construction automatically is a challenging yet important task. This study presents an interpretable artificial intelligence (AI) framework that automatically identifies NATM construction works using low-cost site surveillance images. The framework adopts the Bayesian statistics to combine the prior NATM construction knowledge with the visual evidence extracted by deep learning (DL) based computer vision models. The analysis results of Site CCTV surveillance videos of four NATM tunneling projects are presented to demonstrate its ability (i) to label NATM work cycles from the work timeline, (ii) to identify NATM work categories inside each work cycle, and (iii) to estimate the degree of plan-work deviation at the construction cycle level. The proposed framework yields promising results on a real NATM tunneling project.

AB  - Occupational accidents are frequent in the construction industry, containing significant risks in the working environment. Therefore, early designation, taking preventive actions, and developing a proactive safety risk management plan are of paramount significance in managing safety issues in the construction industry. This study aims to develop a national data-driven safety management framework based on accident outcome prediction, which helps anatomize precursors of fatalities and thereby minimizing fatal accidents on construction sites. A national data set comprising 338,173 occupational accidents recorded in the construction industry across Turkey was used to develop a data-driven model. The random forest algorithm coupled with particle swarm optimization was used for the prediction and the interpretability of the proposed model was augmented through the game theory-based Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) approach. The findings showed that the proposed algorithm achieved satisfactory model performances for detecting construction workers who might face a fatality risk. The SHAP analysis results indicated that both company (such as number of past accidents and workers in the company) and worker-related (such as age, daily wage, experience, shift, and past accident of the workers) attributes were influential in identifying fatalities by detecting which workers might face fatal accidents under which conditions. A construction safety management plan was developed based on the analysis results, which can be used on construction sites to detect workers/conditions that are most susceptible to fatalities. The findings of the present research are expected to contribute to orchestrating effective safety management practices in construction sites by characterizing the root causes of severe accidents.

AB  - Uncovering the association between built environment (BE) attributes and community park visits by considering potential nonlinear effects can inform more effective spatial policies. This study utilizes real-time population visitation big data to depict the spatial variances in community park visits in the case city of Shenzhen. An explainable machine learning method incorporating random forest and Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is applied to reveal the relative importance of BE attributes and to examine the nonlinear associations and interaction effects on park visits. The results confirm the decisive roles of park size and walking-based street connectivity on associating with visits, with threshold points at 2 hm(2)for park size and 0.3 for network warp. The revealed interaction between park size and surrounding BE attributes benefits defining the optimal scale by considering surrounding attributes of both attraction and demand factors. Based on the findings, we further discuss the possible patterns of threshold effects and interaction effects rooted in the examined nonlinearity. The findings guide policy makers in adopting smarter and more effective strategies to improve community park visits.

AB  - Machine learning algorithms in non-linear pattern recognition for defect detection in manufacturing processes are increasingly prevalent in the context of Industry 4.0. This scenario enables factories to develop methodologies for monitoring and controlling the quality of their products, obtaining better operational efficiency indicators, and offering increasingly competitive products in the market. Explainable Artificial Intelligence can facilitate understanding how the models make decisions and assist in tracking anomaly points. This paper proposes an explainability framework for machine learning models in defect detection. This work applied the multinational industry's approach to the tire manufacturing process. Models such as random forest, gradient boosting decision tree, light gradient boosting machine, logistic regression, support vector machine, and multilayer perceptron were considered to evaluate the performance of tires in compliance with production standards. Statistical methodologies had to be adopted to deal with the small number of samples training the machine learning models. The random forest and logistic regression models achieved the best performances with an accuracy of 92% and 96%, respectively. The Local Interpretable Model -Agnostic Explanations and SHapley Additive exPlanations methods were used to identify the relevant process variables. The approach presents the global and local interpretations of the results, allowing for a deeper understanding of how process variables discriminate the fault. The proposed framework determines reference values for each selected process variable for tire manufacturing in compliance with quality standards. This approach provides a relevant tool for quality control management in tire manufacturing industries.

AB  - Accurate flood estimation is crucial for the sustainable design of resilient urban infrastructures, especially in ungauged regions where data scarcity limits traditional hydrological analyses. This study introduces an innovative explainable stacking ensemble learning framework to predict design floods with return periods of 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 and 500 years. The model integrates diverse machine learning techniques to capture the nonlinear and complex relationships between flood magnitudes and catchment characteristics. In the first level of the ensemble, four base models, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), and Extremely Randomized Trees (ERT), are trained. A linear Elastic-Net regression model at the second level combines the results of these base models for the final flood estimates. Performance analysis shows that MLP performs best for lower return periods, while ERT excels for higher ones. Overall, the stacking model outperforms individual models across all return periods, demonstrating its robustness. To enhance model interpretability, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) values are used to reveal the contribution of catchment characteristics to flood behavior, identifying key flood drivers. The results show how feature importance changes with return periods, supporting context-specific decision-making. This research pioneers the use of explainable AI (XAI) in stacking ensemble models for flood estimation, offering a transparent and actionable methodology for urban flood risk management. By integrating advanced modeling, explainability, and remote sensing data through Google Earth Engine, the proposed framework provides a robust decision-support tool for practitioners and policymakers, enhancing the resilience of urban infrastructure to flood hazards.

AB  - Municipalities are increasingly acknowledging the importance of urban form interventions that can reduce intra-city car travel in achieving more sustainable cities. Current academic knowledge for supporting such policies falls short in providing the spatial details required to plan specific interventions. Here, we develop an explainable machine learning framework to identify location-specific relevance of built environment for urban motorised travel, using a sample of 3.5 million car commutes over one year in Berlin and high-resolution urban form data. Results demonstrate that subcenters play a vital role in reducing commuting-related travel distance, giving support to the 15-minute city hypothesis. Observed threshold effects of induced CO2 emissions require low-carbon-policies targeted towards densifying the inner city while releasing peripheral low income communities from car dependence. This research provides a starting point for increasingly rich big data analyses of urban form for creating low-carbon and inclusive urban planning strategies.

AB  - Background: DNA methylation has a significant effect on gene expression and can be associated with various diseases. Meta-analysis of available DNA methylation datasets requires development of a specific workflow for joint data processing.
   Results: We propose a comprehensive approach of combined DNA methylation datasets to classify controls and patients. The solution includes data harmonization, construction of machine learning classification models, dimensionality reduction of models, imputation of missing values, and explanation of model predictions by explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) algorithms. We show that harmonization can improve classification accuracy by up to 20% when preprocessing methods of the training and test datasets are different. The best accuracy results were obtained with tree ensembles, reaching above 95% for Parkinson's disease. Dimensionality reduction can substantially decrease the number of features, without detriment to the classification accuracy. The best imputation methods achieve almost the same classification accuracy for data with missing values as for the original data. XAI approaches have allowed us to explain model predictions from both populational and individual perspectives.
   Conclusions: We propose a methodologically valid and comprehensive approach to the classification of healthy individuals and patients with various diseases based onwhole-blood DNAmethylation data using Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia as examples. The proposed algorithm works better for the former pathology, characterized by a complex set of symptoms. It allows to solve data harmonization problems for meta-analysis ofmany different datasets, imputemissing values, and build classificationmodels of small dimensionality.

AB  - Purpose Surgical skill assessment has received growing interest in surgery training and quality control due to its essential role in competency assessment and trainee feedback. However, the current assessment methods rarely provide corresponding feedback guidance while giving ability evaluation. We aim to validate an explainable surgical skill assessment method that automatically evaluates the trainee performance of liposuction surgery and provides visual postoperative and real-time feedback. Methods In this study, machine learning using a model-agnostic interpretable method based on stroke segmentation was introduced to objectively evaluate surgical skills. We evaluated the method on liposuction surgery datasets that consisted of motion and force data for classification tasks. Results Our classifier achieved optimistic accuracy in clinical and imitation liposuction surgery models, ranging from 89 to 94%. With the help of SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), we deeply explore the potential rules of liposuction operation between surgeons with variant experiences and provide real-time feedback based on the ML model to surgeons with undesirable skills. Conclusion Our results demonstrate the strong abilities of explainable machine learning methods in objective surgical skill assessment. We believe that the machine learning model based on interpretive methods proposed in this article can improve the evaluation and training of liposuction surgery and provide objective assessment and training guidance for other surgeries.

AB  - Tomato diseases significantly impact agricultural productivity, leading to economic losses and reduced quality of crops. Given the importance of tomatoes as a major food source, timely and accurate disease detection is crucial. Traditional manual inspection is error-prone and impracti cal for large-scale farming. This study aims to enhance the accuracy and transparency of tomato leaf disease detection through deep learning techniques. A dataset of 523 images collected from Walkait Setit Humera Zone, with four irrigation sites, was augmented to 3138 images using basic preprocessing methods to improve quality. The dataset was split into training, validation, and testing sets in a 70 %, 10 %, and 20 % ratio. Pre-trained CNN architectures, including Mo bileNetV3, InceptionV3, and DenseNet201, were fine-tuned and implemented on Google Colab with GPU processing for disease detection. Explainable AI methods were employed to increase trust and model transparency. The DenseNet201 model, after fine-tuning, achieved the high est performance with 100 accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This research significantly improves crop production and food security by providing an efficient, accurate, and computa tionally feasible solution for detecting tomato leaf diseases, thereby supporting the sustainable growth of agricultural practices.

AB  - Cruising ride-hailing vehicles exacerbate traffic congestion by generating negative externalities. In contrast, reserved ride-hailing services leverage precise information regarding the departure times and originsdestinations of future trips. Platforms can use this data to dispatch and route drivers more efficiently, thereby reducing the need for cruising. Although previous research has largely concentrated on real-time ride-hailing services, the impact of the built environment on reserved ride-hailing remains unexplored with empirical data. This study integrates multi-source data from Haikou City in China and utilizes the gradient boosting decision tree model, which is an interpretable machine learning approach, to investigate potential relationships between reserved ride-hailing trip demand and the built environment. The rankings of relative importance reveal that factors such as the density of food services, education institutions, accessibility to town centers, and proximity to transportation hubs significantly influence the demand for reserved ride-hailing. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the aforementioned factors exhibit non-linear effects on the demand for reserved ride-hailing. The findings have policy implications for local governments aiming to promote reserved ride-hailing and enhance urban mobility services.

AB  - The increasing knowledge of microbial ecology in food products relating to quality and safety and the established usefulness of machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection in multiple scenarios suggests that the application of microbiome data in food production systems for anomaly detection could be a valuable approach to be used in food systems. These methods could be used to identify ingredients that deviate from their typical microbial composition, which could indicate food fraud or safety issues. The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of using shotgun sequencing data as input into anomaly detection algorithms using fluid milk as a model system. Contrastive principal component analysis (PCA), cluster-based methods, and explainable artificial intelligence (AI) were evaluated for the detection of two anomalous sample classes using longitudinal metagenomic profiling of fluid milk compared to baseline (BL) samples collected under comparable circumstances. Traditional methods (alpha and beta diversity, clustering-based contrastive PCA, multidimensional scaling, and dendrograms) failed to differentiate anomalous sample classes; however, explainable AI was able to classify anomalous vs baseline samples and indicate microbial drivers in association with antibiotic use. We validated the potential for explainable AI to classify different milk sources using larger publicly available fluid milk 16S rDNA sequencing data sets and demonstrated that explainable AI is able to differentiate between milk storage methods, processing stages, and seasons. Our results indicate that the application of artificial intelligence continues to hold promise in the realm of microbiome data analysis and could present further opportunities for downstream analytic automation to aid in food safety and quality.IMPORTANCEWe evaluated the feasibility of using untargeted metagenomic sequencing of raw milk for detecting anomalous food ingredient content with artificial intelligence methods in a study specifically designed to test this hypothesis. We also show through analysis of publicly available fluid milk microbial data that our artificial intelligence approach is able to successfully predict milk in different stages of processing. The approach could potentially be applied in the food industry for safety and quality control.

AB  - The accurate classification of potato leaf diseases plays a pivotal role in ensuring the health and productivity of crops. This study presents a unified approach for addressing this challenge by leveraging the power of Explainable AI (XAI) and transfer learning within a deep Learning framework. In this research, we propose a transfer learning-based deep learning model that is tailored for potato leaf disease classification. Transfer learning enables the model to benefit from pre-trained neural network architectures and weights, enhancing its ability to learn meaningful representations from limited labeled data. Additionally, Explainable AI techniques are integrated into the model to provide interpretable insights into its decision-making process, contributing to its transparency and usability. We used a publicly available potato leaf disease dataset to train the model. The results obtained are 97% for validation accuracy and 98% for testing accuracy. This study applies gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) to enhance model interpretability. This interpretability is vital for improving predictive performance, fostering trust, and ensuring seamless integration into agricultural practices.

Utilizing data from the U.S. National Flood Insurance Program (2003-2023) across four metropolitan areas, it employs k-means clustering and a random forest model to classify and predict property flood risk levels. The model's effectiveness is proven across different metropolitan areas, highlighting the importance of factors like elevation, and impervious surfaces in determining flood risk. FloodGenome's analysis aids in evaluating future urban development impacts on flood risk and refining property flood risk assessments at a detailed level. This tool offers critical insights for flood risk management, supporting the development of urban design strategies to mitigate flood risks.

AB  - Phishing and social engineering contribute to various cyber incidents such as data breaches and ransomware attacks, financial frauds, and denial of service attacks. Often, phishers discuss these attack vectors in dark forums. Further, the probability of phishing attacks and the subsequent loss suffered by the firm are highly correlated. In this context, we propose a hybrid framework using explainable AI techniques to assess cyber-risks generated from correlated phishing attacks. The first phase computes the probability of expert phishers within a community of similar attackers with varying expertise. The second phase calculates the probability of phishing attacks upon a firm even after it has invested in IT security and adopted regulatory steps. The third phase categorises phishing and genuine URLs using various machine-learning-based classifiers. Next, it estimates the joint distribution of phishing attacks using an exponential-beta distribution and quantifies the expected loss using Archimedean Copula. Finally, we offer recommendations for firms through the computation of optimal investments in cyberinsurance versus IT security. First, based on the risk attitude of a firm, it can use this explainable-AI (XAI) framework to optimally invest in building security into its enterprise architecture and plan for cyber-risk mitigation strategies. Second, we identify a long-tail phenomenon demonstrated by the losses suffered during most cyber-attacks, which are not one-off incidents and are correlated. Third, contrary to the belief that cyberinsurance markets are ineffective, it can guide financial firms to design realistic cyber-insurance products.

AB  - To enhance sustainability in the construction industry, substituting primary with recycled aggregates from construction and demolition waste (CDW) is essential. However, the necessary quality assessment of recycled aggregates, especially their particle size distribution (PSD), through sampling and manual sieving is timeconsuming and prone to sampling errors due to the heterogeneity of CDW waste and fluctuating material flows combined with small sampling and manual sieving volumes. Here, we introduce a novel inline monitoring approach using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to estimate PSDs from inline 3D laser triangulation (3DLT) sensor data of both primary and recycled aggregate particles. Analyzing 174,220 particles across nine size classes with a dual camera 3DLT sensor, a customized VGG-inspired CNN model outperformed other architectures, achieving accuracies of 80.8 % and 75.0 % for primary and recycled aggregates at particle level, respectively. Most errors were near-miss classifications, yielding a mean absolute error of 1.0 vol% in PSD predictions at material flow level. Explainable artificial intelligence techniques confirmed the reliance of CNNs on particle contours for robust classification. Our findings offer a pathway for inline PSD monitoring in processing of both primary and recycled aggregates, contributing to a more quality-orientated, circular, and sustainable construction industry.

AB  - There are different approaches in different areas of what the risk is. ISO 31000 risk management standards describe risk as the effect of uncertainty on objectives. Many existing risk assessment procedures are based on the assumption that risk is the amount of any damage or loss multiplied by the probability of an event that could cause the damage. We are proposing a new risk approach, based on Hillson's positive risk philosophy, that risk is not just a threat but also a composition of new opportunities, efforts that need to be put in, and uncertainty. For this approach, we composed a risk formula and a methodology based on that formula. A prototypical software tool was developed, and an experiment was performed using this tool to evaluate the risk of several interconnected projects and validate the developed risk assessment methodology. It should be mentioned that, in the methodology, the decision-making process is performed traceably; therefore, it can be stated that it has explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) traits.

AB  - This study explores the application of interpretable machine learning (ML) models for accurately estimating excavation and installation costs associated with underground high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipeline projects. Leveraging design data from seven projects across Asia, the research evaluates six regression models: linear regression, lasso regression, elastic net regression, random forest regression, XGBoost, and Gaussian process regression. Model performance was assessed using the R-squared (R2) metric, with XGBoost and Gaussian process regression achieving the highest R2 scores (above 0.89) on the testing data sets. Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) analysis reveals that pipe length, diameter, and depth are the most significant predictors, with pipe length contributing most substantially to cost estimations. The results indicate that ML models, particularly XGBoost and Gaussian process regression and stacked models, provide reliable cost predictions when diverse, high-quality data are available, offering a valuable tool for early-stage project budgeting and planning in the pipeline industry.

AB  - Maize leaf diseases pose significant threats to global agricultural productivity, yet traditional diagnostic methods are slow, subjective, and resource-intensive. This study proposes a lightweight and interpretable convolutional neural network (CNN) model for accurate and efficient classification of maize leaf diseases. Using the 'Corn or Maize Leaf Disease Dataset', the model classifies four disease categories Healthy, Gray Leaf Spot, Common Rust, and Northern Leaf Blight with 94.97 % accuracy and a micro-average AUC of 0.99. With only 1.22 million parameters, the model supports real-time inference on mobile devices, making it ideal for field applications. Data augmentation and transfer learning techniques were applied to ensure robust generalization. To enhance transparency and user trust, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, including LIME and SHAP, were employed to identify disease-relevant features such as lesions and pustules, with SHAP achieving an IoU of 0.82. The proposed model outperformed benchmark models like ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNetB0 in both accuracy and computational efficiency. Robustness tests under simulated environmental challenges confirmed its adaptability, with only a 2.82 % performance drop under extreme conditions. Comparative analyses validated its statistical significance and practical superiority. This model represents a reliable, fast, and explainable solution for precision agriculture, especially in resource-constrained environments. Future enhancements will include multi-angle imaging, multimodal inputs, and extended datasets to improve adaptability and scalability in realworld conditions.

AB  - The assessment and classification of architectural sectional drawings is critical in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) field, where the accurate representation of complex structures and the extraction of meaningful patterns are key challenges. This paper established a framework for standardizing different forms of architectural drawings into a consistent graph format, and evaluated different Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) architectures, pooling methods, node features, and masking techniques. This paper demonstrates that GNNs can be practically applied in the design and review process, particularly for categorizing details and detecting errors in architectural drawings. The potential for visual explanations of model decisions using Explainable AI (XAI) is also explored to enhance the reliability and user understanding of AI models in architecture. This paper highlights the potential of GNNs in architectural data analysis and outlines the challenges and future directions for broader application in the AEC field.

AB  - The advent of the fourth industrial revolution, characterized by artificial intelligence (AI) as its central component, has resulted in the mechanization of numerous previously labor-intensive activities. The use of in silico tools has become prevalent in the design of biopharmaceuticals. Upon conducting a comprehensive analysis of the genomes of many organisms, it has been discovered that their tissues can generate specific peptides that confer protection against certain diseases. This study aims to identify a selected group of neuropeptides (NPs) possessing favorable characteristics that render them ideal for production as neurological biopharmaceuticals. Until now, the construction of NP classifiers has been the primary focus, neglecting to optimize these characteristics. Therefore, in this study, the task of creating ideal NPs has been formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. The proposed framework, NPpred, comprises two distinct components: NSGA-NeuroPred and BERT-NeuroPred. The former employs the NSGA-II algorithm to explore and change a population of NPs, while the latter is an interpretable deep learning-based model. The utilization of explainable AI and motifs has led to the proposal of two novel operators, namely p-crossover and p-mutation. An online application has been deployed at https://neuropred.anvil.app for designing an ideal collection of synthesizable NPs from protein sequences.

AB  - With the flourishing development of corpus linguistics and technological revolutions in the AI-powered age, automated essay scoring (AES) models have been intensively developed. However, the intricate relationship between linguistic features and different constructs of writing quality has yet to be thoroughly investigated. The present study harnessed computational analytic tools and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to distill and refine linguistic indicators for model construction. Findings revealed that both micro-features and their combination with aggregated features robustly described writing quality over aggregated features alone. Linear and non-linear models were thus developed to explore the associations between linguistic features and different constructs of writing quality. The non-linear AES model with Random Forest Regression demonstrated superior performance over other benchmark models. Furthermore, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was employed to pinpoint the most powerful linguistic features for each rating trait, enhancing the model's transparency through explainable AI (XAI). These insights hold the potential to substantially facilitate the advancement of multi-dimensional approaches toward writing assessment and instruction.

AB  - Fuzzy cognitive maps and statistical reasoning are considered from the standpoint of explainable artificial intelligence. This approach means that today the artificial intelligence models should also be transparent, conceivable and have explanatory power for the users. We will consider how fuzzy cognitive maps may respond to these challenges because these maps provide a simple and conceivable method for modelling complex phenomena of the real world. Since their construction often stems from sophisticated machine learning and metaheuristic optimization methods as well as their concept values and interrelationships may base on subjective and ambiguous interpretations, we are still encountering problems in this sense. Our approach will apply statistical reasoning and theories, especially regression models, to fuzzy cognitive maps. Hence, we may avoid complex mathematical calculations and operate with objective, unambiguous and conceivable models, and in general, achieve better the aims of explainable artificial intelligence.

AB  - Agriculture is one of the fundamental components of human civilization, contributing not only to food production but also to economic growth. Early identification of diseases in plants presents a significant challenge, as timely identification is crucial to increasing agricultural production. Incorporating the latest technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, in fields can reduce major losses for farmers and also improve productivity. In this paper, we have proposed a Deep Vision transformer and an Explainable AI (XAI)-based technique to address various diseases in plants. Here, we have used the dataset "Plant Village" as a case study that focuses on two majorly grown crops like: potatoes and tomatoes. In addition, we have analysed nine diseases that affect these crops around the world, with tomatoes showing six different conditions and potatoes affected by three bacterial diseases. The proposed DVTXAI framework incorporates the Deep vision transforms to identify plant diseases at an early stage. In the experiments, the proposed model achieves an accuracy of 93.56% for tomatoes and 99.95% for potatoes. Additionally, to make model 'Trustworthy', we make model Explainable, which reveals the transparency mechanism that helps the farmer to make the right decision at an early stage of the crop.

AB  - Nonconformance (NCR) has long been a subject of research interest for its potential to extrapolate information leading to a more productive environment in construction projects. Despite a variety of traditional attempts, a systematic understanding of how machine learning (ML) approaches can contribute to proactively detecting the severity of NCRs remains limited. This study aims to develop a data-driven ML framework to predict the cost impacts of NCRs (high severity versus low severity) in construction projects. To accomplish this aim, the random forest (RF) algorithm reinforced with a metaheuristic hyperparameter-tuning strategy, namely the gravitational search algorithm (GSA), is adopted for the binary classification problem. Furthermore, this study incorporates the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) ensuring transparent interpretations into the GSA-RF predictive framework to tackle the inherent black-box nature of the ML rationale. The results reveal that the proposed model detects the severity of NCRs in terms of their cost impact with an overall AUROC value of 0.776 for the preseparated and blinded testing set. This indicates that the proposed model can be used confidently for newly introduced datasets from real-life cases. In addition, the SHAP analysis results emphasized the role of season, inadequate application procedure, and NCR type in detecting the severity of NCRs. Overall, this research not only makes an important contribution through its novel data-driven approaches but also provides insights for project managers concerning productivity improvements in the sector.

AB  - By incorporating novel social media data, we analyze in detail how US companies offer different employee benefits and how they are associated with several company performance measures. Benefits such as 401(k), employee discounts, parking, and vision/dental healthcare are the most commonly provided, while free food -related benefits and family-related benefits are the most scarcely offered. Furthermore, with the aid of efficient machine learning -based models and tools from explainable artificial intelligence, we discover that family-related benefits are often associated with the most satisfied employees and best-performing companies. Our findings indicate that high-growth companies tend to provide a broad array of benefits to their employees. In contrast, highly profitable companies often concentrate on delivering a more limited and specialized set of benefits. We argue that companies offer rare and highly sought benefits to keep and recruit high-performers.

AB  - Urban air pollution poses significant health risks, especially to pedestrians due to their proximity to pollutants and lack of physical protection. Understanding the influence of built environment factors is essential to mitigate this pollution and safeguard pedestrian health. However, most existing literature focus primarily on pollutant sources and dispersion dynamics, paying less attention to the factors that affect the extent of pedestrian exposure to pollutants. Additionally, while machine learning has gained traction in urban studies, challenges remain in model optimization and interpretability, leading to limited transparency and reduced clarity in environment strategy development. To address these gaps, this study proposes a methodological framework to measure pedestrian-weighted air pollutant concentrations (PWAPC) and analyze the complex effects of the built environment. The objectives include (1) integrating air pollution and pedestrian volume data to quantify PWAPC levels, and (2) employing automated machine learning (AutoML) and interpretable machine learning (IML) to model PWAPC and evaluate key built environment impacts. A case study on PM2.5 concentrations in Central London demonstrates the efficiency of AutoML in algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization. Using IML, critical factors such as points of interest (POIs), traffic infrastructure, diversion ratios, betweenness centrality, street canyon effects, and urban greenness are identified. The analysis also reveals non-linear relationships between these factors and PWAPC. This study provides actionable insights for urban planning and environmental management.

AB  - Employee attrition and high turnover have become critical challenges faced by various sectors in today's competitive job market. In response to these pressing issues, organizations are increasingly turning to artificial intelligence (AI) to predict employee attrition and implement effective retention strategies. This paper delves into the application of explainable AI (XAI) in identifying potential employee turnover and devising data-driven solutions to address this complex problem. The first part of the paper examines the escalating problem of employee attrition in specific industries, analyzing the detrimental impact on organizational productivity, morale, and financial stability. The second section focuses on the utilization of AI techniques to predict employee attrition. AI can analyze historical data, employee behavior, and various external factors to forecast the likelihood of an employee leaving an organization. By identifying early warning signs, businesses can intervene proactively and implement personalized retention efforts. The third part introduces explainable AI techniques which enhance the transparency and interpretability of AI models. By incorporating these methods into AI-based predictive systems, organizations gain deeper insights into the factors driving employee turnover. This interpretability enables human resources (HR) professionals and decision-makers to understand the model's predictions and facilitates the development of targeted retention and recruitment strategies that align with individual employee needs.

AB  - Built environment (BE) is widely perceived as crucial in promoting physical activities (PA). However, the nonlinear and interaction relationships between multilevel (macroscale and microscale) BE and outdoor jogging are poorly explained. Therefore, this work established an explainable machine learning-based analytical framework that integrating Gradient Boosting Decision Tree and SHapley Additive exPlanations to interpret the nonlinear and interaction effects. Employing Beijing, China as the case, this study conducted an empirical analysis of multilevel BE factors affecting outdoor jogging utilizing multi -source big data, including large-scale jogging GPS trajectories and street view images. Results revealed that: (1) Macroscale BE including sports amenities and accessibility play an important role in affecting jogging. (2) All BE factors have nonlinear association with jogging, and the effective range and threshold effects vary by variables. Notably, several variables associated with jogging are in inverted U or V shapes. (3) The complex interaction effects including synergistic, weakened, among BE factors were scrutinized. BE factors regarding accessibility and sports amenity interact more easily. (4) Regions with similar local effects were clustered to understand the spatial varying of BE's influences and establish targeted interventions. These findings can help urban planners design more nuanced intervention strategies for supporting outdoor jogging.

AB  - Recently, Telehealth connects patients to vital healthcare services via remote monitoring, wireless communications, videoconferencing, and electronic consults. By increasing access to specialists and physicians, telehealth assists in ensuring patients receive the proper care at the right time and right place. Teleophthalmology is a study of telemedicine that provides services for eye care using digital medical equipment and telecommunication technologies. Multimedia computing with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) for telehealth has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our society, but several technical challenges should be resolved before this potential can be realized. Advances in artificial intelligence methods and tools reduce waste and wait times, provide service efficiency and better insights, and increase speed, the level of accuracy, and productivity in medicine and telehealth. Therefore, this study develops an XAI-enabled teleophthalmology for diabetic retinopathy grading and classification (XAITO-DRGC) model. The proposed XAITO-DRGC model utilizes OphthoAI IoMT headsets to enable remote monitoring of diabetic retinopathy (DR) disease. To accomplish this, the XAITO-DRGC model applies median filtering (MF) and contrast enhancement as a pre-processing step. In addition, the XAITO-DRGC model applies U-Net-based image segmentation and SqueezeNet-based feature extractor. Moreover, Archimedes optimization algorithm (AOA) with a bidirectional gated recurrent convolutional unit (BGRCU) is exploited for DR detection and classification. The experimental validation of the XAITO-DRGC method can be tested using a benchmark dataset and the outcomes are assessed under distinct prospects. Extensive comparison studies stated the enhancements of the XAITO-DRGC model over recent approaches.

AB  - Efficient identification and remediation of construction defects are critical for ensuring the quality and success of engineering projects. However, the complexity of construction environments poses challenges to this endeavor. Current research predominantly relies on statistical and causal analyses of defect detection reports, yet these methods are time-consuming and errorprone due to the unstructured nature of such reports. To address this, machine learning techniques have been applied to classify defect texts rapidly and accurately. However, existing studies primarily focus on model performance enhancement, neglecting interpretability and the effect of imbalanced data. This study introduces RF-SMOTE, an oversampling technique based on Random Forest (RF), to address the limitations of traditional methods like SMOTE. Comparative analyses demonstrated the efficacy of RF-SMOTE in mitigating imbalanced data effects. Further, the application of SHAP-based interpretability methods in construction management decision -making was explored, filling gaps in existing research. Contributions include providing interpretable machine learning solutions, discussing the effect of imbalanced data, and proposing SHAP-based application scenarios.

AB  - Since early warning is significant to ensure high-quality tunneling boring machine (TBM) construction, a real-time prediction method based on TBM data is proposed. To solve the "black box" problem of prediction by artificial intelligence (AI) methods, the causal explainable gated recurrent unit (CX-GRU) is developed to achieve real-time prediction for TBM parameters. The approach is implemented in a tunnel construction project in Singapore and the results indicate that CX-GRU performs well with the R square score are 0.9140 and 0.9184 in real-time prediction for thrust force and soil pressure. The causal discovery component can increase the computational efficiency of model training by 8.8% on average. According to the SHAP analysis of prediction results, the thrust force is more sensitive to the input TBM features, while the soil pressure is more sensitive to historical data. The CX-GRU is more reliable and efficient when applied to TBM projects than traditional methods.

AB  - Time series forecasting of passenger demand is crucial for optimal planning of limited resources. For smart cities, passenger transport in urban areas is an increasingly important problem, because the construction of infrastructure is not the solution and the use of public transport should be encouraged. One of the most sophisticated techniques for time series forecasting is Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. These deep learning models are very powerful for time series forecasting but are not interpretable by humans (black-box models). Our goal was to develop a predictive and linguistically interpretable model, useful for decision making using large volumes of data from different sources. Our case study was one of the most demanded bus lines of Madrid. We obtained an interpretable model from the LSTM neural network using a surrogate model and the 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic model, which improves the linguistic interpretability of the generated Explainable Artificial Intelligent (XAI) model without losing precision.

AB  - In quest of improving the productivity and efficiency of manufacturing processes, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being used extensively for response prediction, model dimensionality reduction, process optimization, and monitoring. Though having superior accuracy, AI predictions are unintelligible to the end users and stakeholders due to their opaqueness. Thus, building interpretable and inclusive machine learning (ML) models is a vital part of the smart manufacturing paradigm to establish traceability and repeatability. The study addresses this fundamental limitation of AI-driven manufacturing processes by introducing a novel Explainable AI (XAI) approach to develop interpretable processes and product fingerprints. Here the explainability is implemented in two stages: by developing interpretable representations for the fingerprints, and by posthoc explanations. Also, for the first time, the concept of process fingerprints is extended to develop an interpretable probabilistic model for bottleneck events during manufacturing processes. The approach is demonstrated using two datasets: nanosecond pulsed laser ablation to produce superhydrophobic surfaces and wire EDM real-time monitoring dataset during the machining of Inconel 718. The fingerprint identification is performed using a global Lipschitz functions optimization tool (MaxLIPO) and a stacked ensemble model is used for response prediction. The proposed interpretable fingerprint approach is robust to change in processes and can responsively handle both continuous and categorical responses alike. Implementation of XAI not only provided useful insights into the process physics but also revealed the decision-making logic for local predictions.

AB  - The causes of traffic violations by elderly drivers are different from those of other age groups. To reduce serious traffic violations that are more likely to cause serious traffic crashes, this study divided the severity of traffic violations into three levels (i.e., slight, ordinary, severe) based on point deduction, and explore the patterns of serious traffic violations (i.e., ordinary, severe) using multi-source data. This paper designed an interpretable machine learning framework, in which four popular machine learning models were enhanced and compared. Specifically, adaptive synthetic sampling method was applied to overcome the effects of imbalanced data and improve the prediction accuracy of minority classes (i.e., ordinary, severe); multi-objective feature selection based on NSGA-II was used to remove the redundant factors to increase the computational efficiency and make the patterns discovered by the explainer more effective; Bayesian hyperparameter optimization aimed to obtain more effective hyperparameters combination with fewer iterations and boost the model adaptability. Results show that the proposed interpretable machine learning framework can significantly improve and distinguish the performance of four popular machine learning models and two post-hoc interpretation methods. It is found that six of the top ten important factors belong to multi-scale built environment attributes. By comparing the results of feature contribution and interaction effects, some findings can be summarized: ordinary and severe traffic violations have some identical influencing factors and interactive effects; have the same influencing factors or the same combinations of influencing factors, but the values of the factors are different; have some unique influencing factors and unique combinations of influencing factors.

AB  - This paper presents a novel Deep Learning (DL) framework for cotton plant disease prediction based on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and Copula entropy based-Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm. The suggested framework uses a cotton plant image as input and pre-processes it to produce an image with enhanced contrast. Features are extracted from the leaf images with the ResNet50 CNN model. A crucial preprocessing model known as feature selection helps to improve the effectiveness of image classification by deleting extraneous or irrelevant features. Therefore, the Gray Wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm which is a global search method with potential use in feature selection is employed in this paper. The proposed framework introduces Copula entropy (CE) as an indicator of association to create the GWO's initial population and enhance the GWO feature engineering process. For the GWO initialization procedure, CE has been used to choose the most significant features which substantially improved the quality of the GWO starting population and as a result improved the performance of the proposed CE-based GWO algorithm by 78.57% faster than the traditional GWO as stated by the time complexity analysis. In addition, Feature importance explanation is determined using XAI layer. The final classification is achieved using Random Forests (RF) classifier which is an ensemble learning approach. According to the experimental results, the suggested model has a classification accuracy of 99 % and a mean squared error of 0.0383. Furthermore, the proposed model has been compared to state-of-the-art algo- rithms and the results showed that the proposed model has the superiority performance. The proposed model can therefore be used to track a variety of cotton areas to enable faster analysis and response, resulting in higher productivity.

AB  - Geopolymer has been identified as a promising family of sustainable construction materials alternative to cement-based materials. However, designing geopolymer utilizing solid wastes is a challenging task given the large variations of solid wastes in their physical and chemical properties. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes a knowledge graph-guided data-driven approach to design geopolymer utilizing solid wastes, aimed at achieving high mechanical properties, low material cost, and low carbon emission, while largely improving material discovery efficiency. The proposed approach seamlessly integrates knowledge graph, machine learning, and multi-objective optimization, and has been utilized to design ultra-high performance geopolymer (UHPG). This approach has two main novelties: (1) The incorporation of knowledge graph imparts geopolymer domain knowledge, making the machine learning model interpretable and compliant with domain knowledge. (2) The consideration of physical and chemical properties of raw materials enables the utilization of various solid wastes. The results show that the proposed approach can reasonably predict geopolymer properties, interpret prediction results, and optimize UHPG design.

AB  - This systematic review, conducted within the PRISMA framework, investigates the disruptive capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in optimising Operations and Maintenance (OM) practices within the building and civil infrastructure domain. Addressing 5 research questions and encompassing 111 studies from 2014 to 2024, our study identifies the multifaceted applications of GNNs across different project stages from data enhancement to operational scenario enhancement. When considering integrated Facilities Management (FM) approaches, GNNs are employed for data enhancement purposes, leveraging techniques such as semantic enrichment of Building Information Modelling (BIM), various data imputation scenarios, and semantic segmentation of point clouds to enhance data quality and completeness. Operational scenarios involve the utilisation of GNN algorithms for anomaly detection, fault classification, system optimisation, and forecasting. Methodological optimisations crucial for GNN feasibility include feature engineering, architecture optimisation to balance complexity and overfitting risk, and the integration of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods to enhance model validity and trust. Physical principles integration through Physics-Informed Graph Neural Networks (PIGNNs) further enhances model explainability and validation. Future research directions focus on data interoperability enhancement, scalability improvements, and explainability enhancements. Automated graph generation and labelling, heterogeneous GNN models, supporting algorithms such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and reinforcement learning are proposed to overcome analysis limitations. Specific workflows targeting building performance-based semantic enrichment, building systems data imputation, and interdependency prediction are proposed in future directions. The review highlights the symbiotic relationship between GNN-based analysis and digital twin data analysis, emphasising the suitability of GNNs in addressing the demands of digital twin data analysis in the building and civil infrastructure domain.

AB  - With the growing complexity in urban areas, cities have become unprecedentedly intricate systems. This paper aims to develop interpretable machine learning (ML) approaches to unravel the sophisticated associations. In a case study of American urban communities, we apply interpretable ML methods to identify the associations between urban density and multiple health risks. We define urban density from three dimensions of population, built environment, and activity and measure multiple health risks based on categories of physical diseases, mental diseases and health burden. Initially, we conduct cluster analysis to control socioeconomic variables and select study samples. Then we build several ML models of multiple linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and extreme gradient boosting. Interpretable methods, including feature importance, partial dependence plots, individual conditional expectations, and Shapley additive explanations, are used to interpret the models by identifying important factors, non-linear relationships, the interactions between variables. The results show the advantages of interpretable ML methods in efficiency and transparency. Our findings verify that the associations between urban density and multiple health risks are complicated. The similarities and differences between various health risks provide valuable evidence on key factors, thresholds, and pathologic characteristics that can guide the healthy and sustainable development of cities.

LA  - English
AB  - Retrofitting building designs is crucial given the global aging infrastructure and increased in frequency of natural hazards like earthquakes. While traditional data-driven models are widely used for predicting building conditions, there has been limited exploration of recent artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in structural design. This study introduces a novel explainable AI framework that utilizes data-driven models for assessing, designing, and retrofitting of structures. The framework highlights the key global features of the model and further investigates them locally to adjust the input design parameters. It suggests the necessary changes in these inputs to achieve the desired structural performance. To achieve this, the framework employs interpretability techniques such as feature importance, feature interactions, Shapley Additive exPlanations, local interpretable model-agnostic explanations, partial dependence plot (PDP), and individual conditional expectation to highlight the important features. Additionally, a novel counterfactual) technique is applied for the first time as a design tool in seismic assessment and retrofitting of structures. The effectiveness of this framework is validated on a real benchmark structure through nonlinear time history analysis and natural earthquakes. The results show that the proposed framework is highly effective, especially under design-level earthquake conditions in achieving the necessary change in stiffness and strength of structures to meet the required seismic design objectives across different earthquake scenarios. This framework holds promise for wider adoption and applications in various other structural and civil engineering domains.

AB  - Advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms have outperformed traditional approaches in various forecasting applications, especially electricity price forecasting (EPF). However, the prediction accuracy of ML reduces substantially if the input data is not similar to the ones seen by the model during training. This is often observed in EPF problems when market dynamics change owing to a rise in fuel prices, an increase in renewable penetration, a change in operational policies, etc. While the dip in model accuracy for unseen data is a cause for concern, what is more, challenging is not knowing when the ML model would respond in such a manner. Such uncertainty makes the power market participants, like bidding agents and retailers, vulnerable to substantial financial loss caused by the prediction errors of EPF models. Therefore, it becomes essential to identify whether or not the model prediction at a given instance is trustworthy. In this light, this paper proposes a trust algorithm for EPF users based on explainable artificial intelligence techniques. The suggested algorithm generates trust scores that reflect the model's prediction quality for each new input. These scores are formulated in two stages: in the first stage, the coarse version of the score is formed using correlations of local and global explanations, and in the second stage, the score is fine-tuned further by the Shapley additive explanations values of different features. Such score-based explanations are more straightforward than feature-based visual explanations for EPF users like asset managers and traders. A dataset from Italy's and ERCOT's electricity market validates the efficacy of the proposed algorithm. Results show that the algorithm has more than 85% accuracy in identifying good predictions when the data distribution is similar to the training dataset. In the case of distribution shift, the algorithm shows the same accuracy level in identifying bad predictions.

AB  - For over a century, induction furnaces have been used in the core of foundries for metal melting and heating. They provide high melting/heating rates with optimal efficiency. The occurrence of faults not only imposes safety risks but also reduces productivity due to unscheduled shutdowns. The problem of diagnosing faults in induction furnaces has not yet been studied, and this work is the first to propose a data-driven framework for diagnosing faults in this application. This paper presents a deep neural network framework for diagnosing electrical faults by measuring real-time electrical parameters at the supply side. Experimental and sensory measurements are collected from multiple energy analyzer devices installed in the foundry. Next, a semi-supervised learning approach, known as the local outlier factor, has been used to discriminate normal and faulty samples from each other and label the data samples. Then, a deep neural network is trained with the collected labeled samples. The performance of the developed model is compared with several state-of-the-art techniques in terms of various performance metrics. The results demonstrate the superior performance of the selected deep neural network model over other classifiers, with an average F-measure of 0.9187. Due to the black box nature of the constructed neural network, the model predictions are interpreted by Shapley additive explanations and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations. The interpretability analysis reveals that classified faults are closely linked to variations in odd voltage/current harmonics of order 3, 11, 13, and 17, highlighting the critical impact of these parameters on the model's prediction.

AB  - Despite increasing interest in developing interpretable machine learning methods, most recent studies have provided explanations only for single instances, require additional datasets, and are sensitive to hyperparameters. This paper proposes a confusion graph that reveals model weaknesses by constructing a confusion dictionary. Unlike other methods, which focus on the performance variation caused by single-neuron suppression, it defines the role of each neuron in two different perspectives: 'correction' and 'violation'. Furthermore, our method can identify the class relationships in similar positions at the feature level, which can suggest improvements to the model. Finally, the proposed graph construction is model-agnostic and does not require additional data or tedious hyperparameter tuning. Experimental results show that the information loss from omitting the channels guided by the proposed graph can result in huge performance degradation, from 91% to 33%, while the proposed graph only retains 1% of total neurons.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the inadequate readiness of numerous nations to address diseases that could potentially evolve into epidemics or pandemics, posing risks to health systems and supply chains. Statistical analysis and predictive models were developed to manage COVID-19 and other diseases that harm public health. However, few public-policy decision-support tools are documented in the literature, although several governments have created them. In line with the previous developments, this tool uses socioeconomic features to model the COVID-19 province's mortality rates. This paper presents a tool to predict the mortality rate of a province using supervised learning techniques, named CuraZone. This tool was validated using 196 provinces in Peru for training and considering 31 characteristics. The tool displays the dataset's most essential characteristics, shows the country's mean square error (MSE), and predicts a province's mortality rate.

AB  - Gentrification is a complex and context-specific process that involves changes in the built environment and social fabric of neighborhoods, often resulting in the displacement of vulnerable communities. Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful predictive tool that is capable of circumventing the methodological challenges that historically held back researchers from producing reliable forecasts of gentrification. Additionally, computer vision ML algorithms for landscape character assessment, or deep mapping, can now capture a wider range of built metrics related to gentrification-induced redevelopment. These novel ML applications promise to rapidly progress our understandings of gentrification and our capacity to translate academic findings into more productive direction for communities and stakeholders, but with this sudden development comes a steep learning curve. The current paper aims to bridge this divide by providing an overview of recent progress and an actionable template of use that is accessible for researchers across a wide array of academic fields. As a secondary point of emphasis, the review goes over Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) tools for gentrification models and opens up discussion on the nuanced challenges that arise when applying black-box models to human systems.

AB  - Pipeline incidents pose significant concerns due to their potential environmental, economic, and safety risks, emphasizing the critical need to understand and manage this vital infrastructure. While existing studies predominantly focus on the causes of pipeline incidents and failures, few have investigated the consequences, such as shutdown duration, and most lack comprehensive models capable of accurately predicting and providing actionable insights into the risk factors. This study bridges this gap by employing machine learning (ML) techniques, including Random Forest and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), for classifying pipeline incidents' emergency shutdown duration levels. These techniques are specifically designed to capture complex, nonlinear patterns and interdependencies within the data, addressing the limitations of traditional linear approaches. The proposed model has further enhanced with Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, such as Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values, to improve interpretability and provide insights into the factors influencing shutdown durations. Historical incident data, collected from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) from 2010 to 2022, were utilized to examine the risk factors. K-Fold Cross-Validation with 5 folds was employed to ensure the model's robustness. The results demonstrate that the LightGBM model achieved the highest accuracy of 75.0%, closely followed by Random Forest at 74.8%. The integration of XAI techniques provides actionable insights into key factors such as pipeline material, age, installation layout, and commodity type, which significantly influence shutdown durations. These findings underscore the practical implications of the proposed approach, enabling pipeline operators, emergency responders, and regulatory authorities to make informed decisions that optimize resource allocation and mitigate risks effectively.

In this work, we survey the collection and use of annotator rationales. Human-annotated rationales can improve data quality and form a valuable resource for improving machine learning models. Moreover, human-annotated rationales can inspire the construction and evaluation of model-annotated rationales, which can play an important role in explainable artificial intelligence.

AB  - Flood susceptibility mapping (FSM) is crucial for effective flood risk management, particularly in flood-prone regions like Pakistan. This study addresses the need for accurate and scalable FSM by systematically evaluating the performance of 14 machine learning (ML) models in high-risk areas of Pakistan. The novelty lies in the comprehensive comparison of these models and the use of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques. We employed XAI to identify significant conditioning factors for flood susceptibility at both the model training and prediction stages. The models were assessed for both accuracy and scalability, with specific focus on computational efficiency. Our findings indicate that LGBM and XGBoost are the top performers in terms of accuracy, with XGBoost also excelling in scalability, achieving a prediction time of similar to 18 s compared to LGBM's 22 s and random forest's 31 s. The evaluation framework presented is applicable to other flood-prone regions and highlights that LGBM is superior for accuracy-focused applications, while XGBoost is optimal for scenarios with computational constraints. The findings of this study can assist in accurate FSM in different regions and can also assist in scaling up the analysis to a larger geographical region which could assist in better decision-making and informed policy production for flood risk management.

AB  - Power grids, energy generation plants, and energy distribution centres are vulnerable to cyberattacks, which can cause economic damage, disrupt power supply, and can also compromise community safety. In order to avoid the privacy leakage and data loss of multi-located power data, a privacy protection model using UAV networks, explainable AI (XAI) and soft computing is proposed in this article. UAVs are utilized to gather and monitor data from energy infrastructure. This data is very sensitive in nature and the proposed two-level authentication mechanism ensures protection of data from unauthorized access. XAI enhances the data security by analyzing the anomalies or unusual patterns in power data. An encryption method based on chaotic sequence is developed for preventing data leakage. The least squares method is used to assign weights to evaluate the privacy risk of multi-scenario power data. Then a composite chaotic sequence is generated using one and two dimensional logistic chaotic systems for safety of the data. The chaotic sequence encryption process is analyzed, and the differential privacy technology is integrated to devise the privacy protection of power data located at multiple locations. Together, these advanced technologies present a framework which is highly secure and responsive for managing power-data. The experimental results show that the proposed method has strong anti-attack and security policy to avoid the privacy leakage and data loss of multi-scenario power-data. By utilizing advanced technologies such as UAV networks, XAI and multi-level authentication with Chaotic sequence, this research work has offered a secure, simple, and resilient framework to manage and protect energy data from unauthorized access.

AB  - Project control is a crucial phase within project management aimed at ensuring -in an integrated manner- that the project objectives are met according to plan. Earned Value Management -along with its various refinements- is the most popular and widespread method for top-down project control. For project control under uncertainty, Monte Carlo simulation and statistical/machine learning models extend the earned value framework by allowing the analysis of deviations, expected times and costs during project progress. Recent advances in explainable machine learning, in particular attribution methods based on Shapley values, can be used to link project control to activity properties, facilitating the interpretation of interrelations between activity characteristics and control objectives. This work proposes a new methodology that adds an explainability layer based on SHAP -Shapley Additive exPlanations- to different machine learning models fitted to Monte Carlo simulations of the project network during tracking control points. Specifically, our method allows for both prospective and retrospective analyses, which have different utilities: forward analysis helps to identify key relationships between the different tasks and the desired outcomes, thus being useful to make execution/ replanning decisions; and backward analysis serves to identify the causes of project status during project progress. Furthermore, this method is general, model-agnostic and provides quantifiable and easily interpretable information, hence constituting a valuable tool for project control in uncertain environments.

AB  - Modern agriculture faces critical challenges, including climate change induced water shortage, inefficient resource utilization, and reducing soil health which reduce sustainability and reduce crop yields. Traditional farming methods, dependent on manual observation and generalized practices, often lack the precision needed to address these growing issues. To meet these demands, this study presents an artificial intelligence (AI) powered smart agriculture system that integrates deep learning (DL), Internet of Things (IoT), and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to enable intelligent, data-driven farming. This study addresses key challenges such as ineffective soil management, poor irrigation practices, and the absence of personalized crop and fertilizer recommendations. IoT-based sensors provide real-time soil analysis, measuring critical parameters such as nutrient levels, moisture, and temperature. Advanced DL models were employed for various tasks in the AI-Driven Smart Agriculture System. The Transformer-based Tabular Learning (TTL) model for irrigation advice gives an accuracy of 99.13%. For soil analysis, the TabNet regressor achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.51 and an R-2 score of 98.7%, while XAI techniques were used to explain and interpret its predictions. The Sparse Weighted Fusion Transformer (SwiFT) model for crop recommendation gives an accuracy of 98.75%. For fertilizer recommendation, the TabNet classifier achieved an accuracy of 99.3%, with XAI techniques applied to explain the reasoning behind its predictions. These results demonstrate that the system delivers precise and actionable insights. A weather Application Programming Interface (API) is integrated to support timely irrigation decisions through accurate forecasting. A chatbot interface is also added which enhances system usability, accessibility and user-friendliness for farmers. The proposed model improves crop productivity, optimizes resource use, and supports adaptation to environmental changes. By leveraging AI and IoT technologies, the proposed model gives a solution which helps in sustainable agriculture, environmental resilience, and global food security, thus benefiting stakeholders ranging from individual farmers to large-scale agricultural business. Future work will explore real-time adaptive control mechanisms and expand model generalization across diverse geographical region.

AB  - Understanding the mode substitution of shared micro-mobility systems is essential for assessing their societal and environmental impact and developing improvement planning instruments. This study carries out a fine-grained analysis of the mode substitution of dockless bike sharing (DLBS) in relation to other transport modes at the trip level, leveraging multi-modal route planning techniques, transaction data of bike-sharing, and travel behavior modeling. More importantly, the study leverages interpretable machine learning to reveal the complex effects of built environment factors on the mode substitution patterns of DLBS based on multiple data sources. The results indicate that the probabilities of DLBS replacing other transport modes present large heterogeneity among different trips and in different urban contexts, which can be successfully quantified by the proposed approach at the trip level. The average substitution rates of bike-sharing to bus, metro, walking and ride-hailing in Shanghai are estimated to be 0.356, 0.116, 0.347 and 0.181, respectively. Built environment factors such as presence of transit systems can explain the variations in the substitution rates of DLBS to a certain transport mode in different urban contexts. Especially, the effects of some built environment factors show complex nonlinear and threshold patterns revealed by the data-driven method. The effects of key built environment factors are quantitatively interpreted and their practical implications discussed.

AB  - It is important to manage operational disruptions to ensure the success of supply chain operations. To achieve this aim, researchers have developed techniques that determine the occurrence of operational risk events which assists supply chain operational risk managers develop plans to manage them by de-tection/monitoring, mitigation/management, or optimization techniques. Various artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have been used to develop such techniques in the broad activities of operational risk management. However, all of these techniques are black box in their working nature. This means that the chosen technique cannot explain why it has given that output and whether it is correct and free from bias. To address this, researchers argue the need for supply chain management professionals to move towards using explainable AI methods for operational risk management. In this paper, we conduct a systematic literature review on the techniques used to determine operational risks and analyse whether they satisfy the requirement of them being explainable. The findings highlight the shortcomings and inspires directions for future research. From a managerial perspective, the paper encourages risk managers to choose techniques for supply chain operational risk management that can be auditable as this will ensure that the risk managers know why they should take a particular risk management action rather than just what they should do to manage the operational risks.

AB  - Climate change poses significant challenges to global food security by altering precipitation patterns and increasing the frequency of extreme weather events such as droughts, heatwaves, and floods. These phenomena directly affect agricultural productivity, leading to lower crop yields and economic losses for farmers. This study leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to predict crop yields and assess the impacts of climate change on agriculture, providing a novel approach to understanding complex interactions between climatic and agronomic factors. Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), the study identifies temperature as the most critical factor influencing crop yields, with notable interactions observed between rainfall patterns and macronutrient levels. Advanced regression models, including Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and LightGBM Regressor, achieved exceptional predictive performance, with R-2 scores reaching 0.92, mean squared errors as low as 0.02, and mean absolute errors of 0.015. Additionally, XAI techniques such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) enhanced the interpretability of the predictions, offering actionable insights into the relative importance of key features. These insights inform strategies for agricultural decision-making and climate adaptation. By integrating AI-driven predictions with XAI-based interpretability, this research presents a robust and transparent framework for mitigating the adverse effects of climate change on agriculture, emphasizing its potential for scalable application in precision farming and policy development.

AB  - The saturation of the ride-hailing market has intensified competition among drivers for ride requests, leading to a continuous decline in their satisfaction. Understanding the impact of built environment variables on drivers' access to services has become crucial. This study defines Ride-hailing Service Discontinuity (RSD) by weighting the transfer time and distance between two consecutive rides of drivers to quantify the difficulty drivers face in accessing services. This paper explores the effects of built environment variables on RSD in Hangzhou by integrating Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) clustering, Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network (CTGAN) data augmentation, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) combined with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) explainable machine learning technique, and Stacking Ensemble Prediction. The results indicate that the impact of built environment variables on RSD exhibits regional variability and nonlinear effects. The nonlinear effects are manifested in two forms: similar nonlinear patterns with different thresholds and changes in nonlinear form. Threshold effects are widely observed in built environment variables, and some variables (e.g., Slope) exhibit consistent marginal contribution to RSD within a specific threshold range. In addition, the Stacking Ensemble Prediction is better at capturing the inherent relationships between variables and RSD, demonstrating higher prediction accuracy. In particular, when the performance of base models is moderate, the ensemble prediction performs better. This study provides a novel approach to understanding the impact of the built environment on ride-hailing from the driver's perspective.

AB  - Deep learning models are black boxes. Thus, determining the source domain data contributing to transfer learning for ground settlement prediction is impossible. The research presented in this article aims to determine the source domain data (i.e., the dataset or domain used for model pretraining) that contributes most to transfer learning for risk prediction in tunnel construction and quantify its contribution to improving prediction accuracy. We propose a novel explainable transfer learning approach to quantify the selection of degraded knowledge from source and subsource domains. Our approach comprises feature selection and space point clustering, construction of a similarity metric between the target domain and each subsource domain, and construction of a stacked deep neural network model with selective transfer learning. We apply our model to a real-life tunnel project to demonstrate its feasibility and effectiveness. The results indicate that our proposed explainable transfer learning approach outperforms other transparent and opaque analysis models on risk prediction with R-2 above 0.5 by adjusting the clustering, transferring, and freezing strategy, and the optimal number of freezing layers should be less than half of the total number of layers, and the best number of freezing layers is 1. We show that explaining transfer learning enables transparency in training and understanding the source domain data, contributing to ground settlement prediction.

AB  - Food safety remains a critical public health conceated food causing significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Accurate and transparent risk assessment is essential to safeguard consumer health and support evidence-based regulatory decisions. This study introduces a comprehensive and novel AI framework that leverages machine learning, deep learning, and transformer-based models to classify food safety risks using the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) dataset, enhanced through advanced data enrichment techniques. The enriched dataset addressed challenges such as short explanations and class imbalances, resulting in significant performance improvements across all model categories. Transformer-based models, including BERT with an accuracy of 0.978 and RoBERTa with an accuracy of 0.979, outperformed traditional machine learning methods such as logistic regression, which achieved an accuracy of 0.954, and SVM, which reached 0.959, as well as deep learning models like LSTM, which obtained 0.971, and BiLSTM, which achieved 0.97 3. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques were applied to uncover critical insights into the models' decision-making processes. Influential features such as salmonella, aflatoxins, and listeria were identified, enhancing model transparency and interpretability. The framework's combination of data augmentation and XAI improves predictive accuracy while ensuring interpretability, making it suitable for real-time risk prioritization in regulatory surveillance. This study demonstrates the potential of AI-powered approaches for food safety risk assessment, bridging predictive accuracy with transparency to support more reliable and actionable food safety management systems.

AB  - Agriculture serves as the predominant driver of a country's economy, constituting the largest share of the nation's manpower. Most farmers are facing a problem in choosing the most appropriate crop that can yield better based on the environmental conditions and make profits for them. As a consequence of this, there will be a notable decline in their overall productivity. Precision agriculture has effectively resolved the issues encountered by farmers. Today's farmers may benefit from what's known as precision agriculture. This method takes into account local climate, soil type, and past crop yields to determine which varieties will provide the best results. The explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) technique is used with radial basis functions neural network and spider monkey optimization to classify suitable crops based on the underlying soil and environmental conditions. The XAI technology would provide assets in better transparency of the prediction model on deciding the most suitable crops for their farms, taking into account a variety of geographical and operational criteria. The proposed model is assessed using standard metrics like precision, recall, accuracy, and F1-score. In contrast to other cutting-edge approaches discussed in this study, the model has shown fair performance with approximately 12% better accuracy than the other models considered in the current study. Similarly, precision has improvised by 10%, recall by 11%, and F1-score by 10%.

AB  - Geopolymer concrete (GC) emerges as a sustainable alternative yet faces challenges in achieving optimal resource utilization for strength development. Balancing these aspects is crucial for its large-scale adoption as a sustainable material. The type and dosage of precursors, activator, curing, and mixing conditions influence compressive strength, setting time, and workability. Moreover, multiple experimental trials are required for a desirable geopolymer blend. Even the experimental parameters alone do not meet the design principles concerning sustainable construction. This paper presents a study on the mix design and interpretation of machine learning techniques (MLT) with XAI. To train the model, extensive experimental databases using the shapley additive explanations (SHAP) technique rank input factors that impact the strength aspect. The prediction models' performance was compared using coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE). SHAP interpretations reveal that temperature, Na to Al ratio, and NaOH molarity are the main factors influencing the compressive strength of GC. Further, these parameters were crucial in developing the dense geopolymer matrix. By integrating XAI into the MLT approach, we have also opened new criteria for understanding the complex relationships between geopolymer concrete potential parameters and their compressive strength.

AB  - Optimizing agricultural productivity and promoting sustainability necessitates accurate predictions of crop yields to ensure food security. Various agricultural and climatic variables are included in the analysis, encompassing crop type, year, season, and the specific climatic conditions of the Indian state during the crop's growing season. Features such as crop and season were one-hot encoded. The primary objective was to predict yield using a deep neural network (DNN), with hyperparameters optimized through genetic algorithms (GAs) to maximize the R2 score. The best-performing model, achieved by fine-tuning its hyperparameters, achieved an R2 of 0.92, meaning it explains 92% of the variation in crop yields, indicating high predictive accuracy. The optimized DNN models were further analyzed using explainable AI (XAI) techniques, specifically local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME), to elucidate feature importance and enhance model interpretability. The analysis underscored the significant role of features such as crops, leading to the incorporation of an additional dataset to classify the most optimal crops based on more detailed soil and climate data. This classification task was also executed using a GA-optimized DNN, aiming to maximize accuracy. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in predicting crop yields and classifying optimal crops.

AB  - This study systematically reviews the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and remote sensing technologies to address the issue of crop water stress caused by rising global temperatures and climate change; in particular, it evaluates the effectiveness of various non-destructive remote sensing platforms (RGB, thermal imaging, and hyperspectral imaging) and AI techniques (machine learning, deep learning, ensemble methods, GAN, and XAI) in monitoring and predicting crop water stress. The analysis focuses on variability in precipitation due to climate change and explores how these technologies can be strategically combined under data-limited conditions to enhance agricultural productivity. Furthermore, this study is expected to contribute to improving sustainable agricultural practices and mitigating the negative impacts of climate change on crop yield and quality.

AB  - As the aging population grows rapidly, the traffic risks faced by older adults have become a growing concern for age-friendly transportation planning. While prior studies have investigated the relationship between traffic crashes and the built environment, they often treat the population as homogeneous and ignore the fine-grained characteristics of the street environment. This study addresses these gaps by examining how fine-grained street environments influence crash risks, with a particular focus on aging people. Specifically, we use segmented street view images to train models that predict crash risk levels based on normalized crash frequencies, with separate models developed for older and non-older populations. Interpretable machine learning methods are then employed to identify key environmental contributors and to compare their spatial contribution patterns across age groups. Our findings reveal that the traffic crash risk of older adults is more strongly influenced by street environment indicators, both positive and negative, indicating their greater sensitivity to environmental conditions. Moreover, the contribution of street features differs significantly between age groups, not only in overall trends but also in the spatial patterns of their impact. Our research uncovers age-specific interactions with the street environment and emphasizes the need for differentiated transportation planning approaches.

AB  - Beyond 5G networks, (B5G) introduce the emergence of a smart service and an automate management archetype of running network slices, such as the network data analytics function (NWDAF). These new architectures provide a large usage of advanced machine learning algorithms, in order to dynamically build efficient decisions. In this perspective, the Distributed Learning (D-), known as A Distributed NWDAF Architecture (D-NWDAF) has proved its efficiency in not only building collaborative deep learning models, among several network slices, but also ensuring the privacy and isolation of such network slices. Notwithstanding, FL is vulnerable to different attacks, where FL nodes (Leaf NWDAF: AI-VNFs*) may upload malicious updates to the FL central (root NWDAF) entity so that it can cause a construction failure of the FL global model and affect the global performance. Moreover, attacks detection of FL-based solutions give "black-box" decisions about the performance of running network slices and the attacks detected. In other words, detection solutions do not provide any details about why and how such ML attacks decisions were made. Thus, such decisions cannot be properly trusted and comprehended by B5G slice managers. To resolve this issue, we leverage Dimensional Reduction (DR) and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) algorithms which aim to detect attacks and improve the transparency of black-box FL attacks detection-making process. In the present article, we design a novel DR-XAI-powered framework to detect attacks and explain the FL-based attacks detection. We first build a deep learning model in a federated way, to predict key performance indicators (KPI) of network slices. Then, we try to detect the malicious FL nodes, using DR and several XAI models, such as RuleFit, in order to enhance the level of trustiness, transparency, and the explanation of the FL-based attacks detection, while adhering the data privacy, to different B5G network stakeholders.

AB  - Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The early and accurate detection of lung cancer is crucial for improving patient outcomes. Traditional predictive models often lack the accuracy and interpretability required in clinical settings. This study aims to enhance lung cancer prediction accuracy using ensemble learning methods while integrating explainable AI (XAI) techniques to ensure model interpretability. Advanced ensemble learning techniques, such as Voting and Stacking, have been implemented to improve the predictive accuracy compared to traditional models. The models are implemented on three real lung cancer datasets, comprising lifestyle data of the patients, and assessed using various performance metrics, highlighting their reliability in clinical diagnosis. XAI methods are incorporated to ensure the models are interpretable, fostering trust among clinicians. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values are utilized to identify and prioritize clinical and demographic factors influencing risk predictions. The ensemble models demonstrate superior performance metrics, significantly improving lung cancer prediction accuracy. Specifically, the Stacking ensemble model achieves the average prediction accuracy of 99.59 %, precision of 100 %, recall of 97.64 %, F1score 98.65 %, AUC of 100 %, Kappa 98.40 %, and MCC of 98.44 % across three datasets. We employed the Friedman aligned ranks test and Holm post hoc analysis to validate performance, showing that the Stacking ensemble consistently outperformed others with higher accuracy and reliable predictions. Feature importance analysis reveals critical risk factors, providing insights into their interconnectivity and enhancing risk assessment frameworks. Integrating XAI techniques ensures the models are interpretable, promoting their potential adoption in clinical practices. The findings support the development of targeted interventions and effective risk management strategies, aiming to improve patient outcomes in lung cancer diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - Optimizing the built environment to foster urban vitality is essential for effective urban planning and sustainable development. Previous studies have predominantly focused on analyzing the relationship between the built environment and urban vitality at either a macro or micro-scale, often assuming a predefined linear relationship. In this study, we investigate the potential non-linear interactions between the built environment and urban vitality by employing an interpretable spatial machine learning framework that integrates the XGBoost model with the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm. Additionally, we analyze the determinants of urban vitality across both micro and macro-scales using multi-source data, semantic segmentation models, and street view imagery. Our findings reveal the following key insights: (1) the distribution of urban vitality exhibits spatial heterogeneity within the main urban area of Shanghai, with high vitality areas concentrated in the Huangpu District and at intersections with neighboring districts, demonstrating a decline from the center to the periphery; (2) the XGBoost model outperforms other comparative models, showcasing superior capabilities in simulating and predicting urban vitality; (3) among the various built environment factors influencing urban vitality, building coverage, population density, and distance to the CBD exert the most significant effects, while the green view index and the number of bus stops contribute relatively less; (4) all built environment factors demonstrate nonlinear impacts and exhibit certain threshold effects on urban vitality. The analytical outcomes of this study provide valuable insights for optimizing the spatial layout and resource allocation within urban settings, offering references for urban planning and sustainable development initiatives.

AB  - The paper proposes an explainable AI model that can be used in fintech riskmanagement and, in particular, in measuring the risks that arise when credit is borrowed employing peer to peer lending platforms. The model employs Shapley values, so that AI predictions are interpreted according to the underlying explanatory variables. The empirical analysis of 15,000 small and medium companies asking for peer to peer lending credit reveals that both risky and not risky borrowers can be grouped according to a set of similar financial characteristics, which can be employed to explain and understand their credit score and, therefore, to predict their future behavior.

AB  - We consider the problem of developing explainable Artificial Intelligence methods to interpret the results of Artificial Intelligence models for time series data, taking time dependency into account. To this end, we extend the Shapley-Lorenz method, normalised by construction, to Artificial Intelligence for time series, such as neural networks and recurrent neural networks. We illustrate the application of our proposal to a time series of Bitcoin prices, which acts as the response variable, along with time series of classical financial prices, which act as explanatory variables. Three main findings emerge from the analysis. First, recurrent neural networks lead to a better performance, in terms of accuracy and robustness, with respect to classic neural networks. Second, the best performing models indicate that Bitcoin prices are affected mostly by their lagged values, and that their explainability, in terms of classical financial assets, is limited. Third, although limited, the contribution of classical assets to Bitcoin price prediction is well captured by recurrent neural networks.

AB  - This article demonstrates the use of data mining methods for evidence-based smart decision support in quality control. The data were collected in a measurement campaign which provided a new and potential quality measurement approach for manufacturing process planning and control. In this study, the machine learning prediction models and Explainable AI methods (XAI) serve as a base for the decision support system for smart manufacturing. The discovered information about the root causes behind the predicted failure can be used to improve the quality, and it also enables the definition of suitable security boundaries for better settings of the production parameters. The user's need defines the given type of information. The developed method is applied to the monitoring of the surface roughness of the stainless steel strip, but the framework is not application dependent. The modeling analysis reveals that the parameters of the annealing and pickling line (RAP) have the best potential for real-time roughness improvement.

AB  - The workability of fresh concrete is highly important in terms of construction quality and safety. Slump tests are required every 120 m3, yet automated monitoring for each concrete batch remains unavailable in the actual concrete batching plant. To mitigate this issue, we propose an automatic slump prediction method based on the VGG16 neural network by analyzing the video from the final discharge hopper of the batching plant. Additionally, Explainable AI (XAI) is adopted to evaluate and validate our automatic concrete quality inspection approach. Iteratively examining XAI outputs and applying necessary adjustments in data preprocessing helps to achieve better overall performance. The proposed video classification method performed by averaging over the image-level predictions can classify the concrete into four slump classes with an average precision of 85% and an average F1 score of 87%. This demonstrates the possibility of continuous quality evaluation for all concrete produced in the concrete batching plant.

In addition to the predictive accuracy of machine learning methods, the ability to interpret what a model has learned is crucial in the finance industry. We address this challenge by adapting interpretable machine learning to the context of corporate bond recovery rate modeling. In addition to the best performance, we show the value of interpretable machine learning by finding drivers of recovery rates and their relationship that cannot be discovered by the use of traditional machine learning methods. Our findings are financially meaningful and consistent with the findings in the existing credit risk literature.

AB  - This study suggests the implementation of the Logic Learning Machine (LLM) methodology to model the default probabilities of a dataset of American firms. This advanced supervised Machine Learning technique, which has the advantage of being inherently "white box", was developed using a lean low-code development platform that allows the use of the paradigm of visual block programming. The probability default model for an optimal credit risk management was solved using both a statistical regression and a classification approach. The performance obtained in our case study was then compared with that of a Classification and Regression Tree (CART), one of the few supervised Machine Learning techniques that can be considered natively "white box". The results achieved by the LLM proved to be superior both in terms of performance and explainability compared to those obtained with the CART.

AB  - What does the Lacanian notion of fantasy offer to the study of security imaginaries? The article answers this question by introducing a fantasmatic reading strategy illustrated by a case study of the US narrative of 'technological revolutions of war' that has recently been fueled by a growing demand for ethical and explainable artificial intelligence in military applications and weapon systems. The article offers a Lacanian comment to the expanding International Relations literature on security imaginaries. It demonstrates how a fantasmatic reading encompasses both a discourse analytical tracing of background understandings employed by many security imaginary scholars and an affective tracing at the margins of discourse that captures the force with which subjects continue to invest in - and patch the constitutive gaps of - a security imaginary. In studying security imaginaries through fantasies, we propose zooming in on three analytical moves: analyzing the continuing construction of a lost utopia in security discourses; following the specific objects of desire that is organized around its own inevitable failure; and locating the mode of enjoyment encountered at the boundaries of the socially acceptable norms.

AB  - Evaluating the damage caused by supply chain disruptions triggered by natural hazards has an important role in supply chain risk management. This study proposes a novel approach to predict annual sales change rates for firms post-hazard. The approach employs graph neural networks, a machine learning technique that considers both internal factors such as sales and number of employees and external factors such as inter-firm relations and damages incurred from hazards. The model was trained on firm and flood data from previous floods in Japan and was found to outperform baseline models that did not consider inter-firm relations. To address the model's explainability problem, we employed Explainable Artificial Intelligence techniques to identify the factors influencing sales post-disruption and analysed the importance of firms and trades in the supply chain from a spatial perspective. The findings highlight the crucial role of business partners in a firm's supply chain and the impact of distance between suppliers on a firm's sales. The study contributes to improved supply chain risk management practices in industry as well as government, ultimately enhancing supply chain resilience.

AB  - Video surveillance and image acquisition systems represent one of the most active research topics in computer vision and smart city domains. The growing concern for public and workers' safety has led to a significant increase in the use of surveillance cameras that provide high-definition images and even depth maps when 3D cameras are available. Consequently, the need for automatic techniques for behavior analysis and action recognition is also increasing for several applications such as dangerous actions detection in railway stations or construction sites, event detection in crowd videos, behavior analysis, optimization in industrial sites, etc. In this context, several computer vision and deep learning solutions have been proposed recently where deep neural networks provided more accurate solutions, but they are not so efficient in terms of explainability and flexibility since they remain adapted for specific situations only. Moreover, the complexity of deep neural architectures requires the use of high computing resources to provide fast and real-time computations. In this paper, we propose a review and a comparative analysis of deep learning solutions in terms of precision, explainability, computation time, memory size, and flexibility. Experimental results are conducted within simulated and real-world dangerous actions in railway construction sites. Thanks to our comparative analysis and evaluation, we propose a personalized approach for dangerous action recognition depending on the type of collected data (image) and users' requirements.

AB  - Stay-at-home orders were globally adopted as one of the most important nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) during the recent global pandemic. In a high-rise high-density context of Hong Kong, inter-building airborne transmissions were reported, especially in public housing. The role of residential building design in infection dynamics is under-studied. To unravel how architectural and urban design was linked to airborne virus transmission during the pandemic, we fitted explainable machine learning (EML) models associating COVID-19 prevalence with architectural design controlling for other built environment (BE) factors including socio-demographics, road information, land use, and points of interest (POIs). 284 public housing that underwent restrictiontesting declaration (RTD) during the peak period of the pandemic's fifth wave were our sample. An additional 35 RTD-issued private housing blocks were used for an initial comparison of infection prevalence across public and private housing. Our findings show a significant differential in prevalence over different design forms, with "8-" and "L-" shaped buildings appearing to be more susceptible, with a significantly greater percentage of infections than "X-" and "Y-" shaped structures. The percentage of vacant land, public residential within a 500-m buffer, and the proportion of children ages under 14 at small tertiary planning unit level (STPU) were the three most influential co-variates in our model. Among specific architectural design features, the number of floors, radial layouts, and building corners were the most significantly associated with COVID-19 prevalence, followed by building average flat (apartment) size and shape factor. The study indicates that public housing residents were more at risk during this wave of the pandemic, which needs further investigation. Using machine learning, we provide insights into how to manage the design of high density neighbourhoods for resilience against airborne disease vectors.

TI  - What Determines Carbon Emissions of Multimodal Travel? Insights from Interpretable Machine Learning on Mobility Trajectory Data

AB  - Understanding the carbon emissions of multimodal travel-comprising walking, metro, bus, cycling, and ride-hailing-is essential for promoting sustainable urban mobility. However, most existing studies focus on single-mode travel, while underlying spatiotemporal and behavioral determinants remain insufficiently explored due to the lack of fine-grained data and interpretable analytical frameworks. This study proposes a novel integration of high-frequency, real-world mobility trajectory data with interpretable machine learning to systematically identify the key drivers of carbon emissions at the individual trip level. Firstly, multimodal travel chains are reconstructed using continuous GPS trajectory data collected in Beijing. Secondly, a model based on Calculate Emissions from Road Transport (COPERT) is developed to quantify trip-level CO2 emissions. Thirdly, four interpretable machine learning models based on gradient boosting-XGBoost, GBDT, LightGBM, and CatBoost-are trained using transportation and built environment features to model the relationship between CO2 emissions and a set of explanatory variables; finally, Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and partial dependence plots (PDPs) are used to interpret the model outputs, revealing key determinants and their non-linear interaction effects. The results show that transportation-related features account for 75.1% of the explained variance in emissions, with bus usage being the most influential single factor (contributing 22.6%). Built environment features explain the remaining 24.9%. The PDP analysis reveals that substantial emission reductions occur only when the shares of bus, metro, and cycling surpass threshold levels of approximately 40%, 40%, and 30%, respectively. Additionally, travel carbon emissions are minimized when trip origins and destinations are located within a 10 to 11 km radius of the central business district (CBD). This study advances the field by establishing a scalable, interpretable, and behaviorally grounded framework to assess carbon emissions from multimodal travel, providing actionable insights for low-carbon transport planning and policy design.

AB  - Background: Infant meningitis can be a life-threatening disease and requires prompt and accurate diagnosis to prevent severe outcomes or death. Gold-standard diagnosis requires lumbar puncture (LP) to obtain and analyze cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Despite being standard practice, LPs are invasive, pose risks for the patient and often yield negative results, either due to contamination with red blood cells from the puncture itself or because LPs are routinely performed to rule out a life-threatening infection, despite the disease's relatively low incidence. Furthermore, in low-income settings where incidence is the highest, LPs and CSF exams are rarely feasible, and suspected meningitis cases are generally treated empirically. There is a growing need for non-invasive, accurate diagnostic methods. Methodology: We developed a three-stage deep learning framework using Neosonics ultrasound technology for 30 infants with suspected meningitis and a permeable fontanelle at three Spanish University Hospitals (from 2021 to 2023). In stage 1, 2194 images were processed for quality control using a vessel/non-vessel model, with a focus on vessel identification and manual removal of images exhibiting artifacts such as poor coupling and clutter. This refinement process resulted in a final cohort comprising 16 patients-6 cases (336 images) and 10 controls (445 images), yielding 781 images for the second stage. The second stage involved the use of a deep learning model to classify images based on a white blood cell count threshold (set at 30 cells/mm3) into control or meningitis categories. The third stage integrated explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods, such as Grad-CAM visualizations, alongside image statistical analysis, to provide transparency and interpretability of the model's decisionmaking process in our artificial intelligence-driven screening tool. Results: Our approach achieved 96% accuracy in quality control and 93% precision and 92% accuracy in imagelevel meningitis detection, with an overall patient-level accuracy of 94%. It identified 6 meningitis cases and 10 controls with 100% sensitivity and 90% specificity, demonstrating only a single misclassification. The use of gradient-weighted class activation mapping-based XAI significantly enhanced diagnostic interpretability, and to further refine our insights we incorporated a statistics-based XAI approach. By analyzing image metrics such as entropy and standard deviation, we identified texture variations in the images attributable to the presence of cells, which improved the interpretability of our diagnostic tool. Conclusion: This study supports the efficacy of a multi-stage deep learning model for non-invasive screening of infant meningitis and its potential to guide the need for LPs. It also highlights the transformative potential of artificial intelligence in medical diagnostic screening for neonatal health care, paving the way for future research and innovations.

AB  - The implementation of adaptive optimization in multi-product process manufacturing is a crucial strategy for the reduction of unplanned downtime and the enhancement of overall productivity. Nevertheless, the availability of real-time decision support tools for dynamic adjustments in large-scale industries is currently limited. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel model that processes data collected from extensive manufacturing operations. By leveraging Explainable Artificial Intelligence, we developed a real-time decision support system designed to dynamically adjust process parameters following varying input variables. The proposed model achieved a capture rate of 62% of the minority of products that cause micro-stoppages due to non-compliance with specifications. This approach provides a robust framework for adaptive optimization in complex and large-scale manufacturing environments, enhancing productivity and resilience against unplanned disruptions.

KW  - IMPACTS
AB  - Concurrent climate extremes have severe consequences on societies, economies, and natural systems. Multi-hazard risk-oriented early warning systems are essential to reduce impacts, enhance preparedness, and boost adaptation. Yet, the growing volume and variety of spatio-temporal data combined with the increasing frequency of concurrent extremes pose challenges to the rapid detection and tracking of harmful events. Artificial intelligence offers an opportunity to deal with these challenges, especially when interpretability and explainability are ensured. Here, we show how expert-driven and explainable artificial intelligence models can probabilistically detect multiple agriculture-related hazards. The models are trained using the work of agro-climatic experts who, over decades, operationally identified multiple climate hazards affecting agriculture in Europe. The models identify the main drivers leading to the detection of affected areas while effectively dealing with large datasets to provide probabilistic results and uncertainty estimation. Results highlight the added value of expert-driven and explainable artificial intelligence models in supporting risk management as well as effective and sustainable adaptation, particularly when integrated into early warning systems and sectoral climate services. Grounded on expert-driven information, the models contribute to a better understanding of the complex dynamics behind the onset and spatio-temporal evolution of climate extremes and to enhanced trust in defining and communicating affected areas.

AB  - Pocket parks are regarded as valuable tools for providing green activity spaces for citizens in high-density mountainous cities. However, existing research on the pocket park vitality has hardly paid attention to mountainous cities. Due to the unique topographical conditions of mountainous cities, the built environment factors influencing the pocket parks vitality may be more complex, new indicators such as sky view factors, average slope and building enclosure have been taken into account. This study takes Chongqing as a case study of a mountainous city. It utilizes location-based service data to measure pocket park vitality. An interpretable machine learning model that integrates eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is employed to explore the nonlinear effects and interactions of built environment factors on pocket park vitality. Results indicate that: (1) Sky view factors and residential population are significant factors affecting pocket park vitality in mountainous cities. (2) Different built environment elements in mountainous cities have optimal threshold effects on pocket park vitality. For example, optimal park areas of less than 0.08 ha, vegetation coverage rates below 0.57 are built environment intervals that can significantly enhance pocket park vitality. (3) The spatial distribution map of SHAP values and the interaction analysis reveal the spatial effects and interrelationships of built environment factors. For example, the interaction between Residential Population and Floor Area Ratio exemplifies the complex mechanism of the synergistic impact of multiple factors. We further explain specific pocket parks in combination with local contributions and put forward precise optimization strategies based on the park attributes and characteristics of the surrounding environment.

AB  - Several countries have implemented designated school zones and installed traffic calming measures to enhance the safety of vulnerable pedestrians near schools. While macro-level built environment attributes (e.g., land use) have been widely acknowledged in relation to the role they play in urban traffic safety, the effects of micro-level streetscape characteristics on crash frequency have not been investigated to any significant extent. Moreover, the associations between these environmental features and crashes in school zones remains largely unknown. To address this issue, we first identified school zone-related crash hotspot using spatiotemporal hotspot mining on a comprehensive dataset of 20,484 pedestrian-vehicle crashes between 2017 and 2021 in Seoul, South Korea. Streetscape characteristics were analysed using street view imagery and advanced computer vision techniques to extract and classify pixel-wise visual elements. Preliminary findings reveal spatiotemporal variations in fatal and severe injury (FSI) crashes, with school zones in central commercial and industrial areas emerging as persistent crash hotspots that have remained statistically significant hotspots for 90 % of the study period. Further impact analysis using interpretable machine learning helped to uncover the non-linear relationships between both micro and macro environmental features and FSI frequency. Lower levels of street enclosure and walkability were associated with a higher frequency of FSI crashes, while increased openness and imageability were also correlated with more FSI incidents. Additionally, street greenery was found to reduce FSI crashes once it reached a certain threshold. Our findings extend existing knowledge of how the built environment and streetscape design influence pedestrian safety in school zones, paving the way for more targeted interventions to plan safer pedestrian environments around schools.

AB  - Preplaced aggregate concrete (PAC) also known as two-stage concrete (TSC) is widely used in construction engineering for various applications. To produce PAC, a mixture of Portland cement, sand, and admixtures is injected into a mold subsequent to the deposition of coarse aggregate. This process complicates the prediction of compressive strength (CS), demanding thorough investigation. Consequently, the emphasis of this study is on enhancing the comprehension of PAC compressive strength using machine learning models. Thirteen models are evaluated with 261 data points and eleven input variables. The result depicts that xgboost demonstrates exceptional accuracy with a correlation coefficient of 0.9791 and a normalized coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9583. Moreover, Gradient boosting (GB) and Cat boost (CB) also perform well due to its robust performance. In addition, Adaboost, Voting regressor, and Random forest yield precise predictions with low mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) values. The sensitivity analysis (SA) reveals the significant impact of key input parameters on overall model sensitivity. Notably, gravel takes the lead with a substantial 44.7% contribution, followed by sand at 19.5%, cement at 15.6%, and Fly ash and GGBS at 5.9% and 5.1%, respectively. The best fit model i.e., XG-Boost model, was employed for SHAP analysis to assess the relative importance of contributing attributes and optimize input variables. The SHAP analysis unveiled the water-to-binder (W/B) ratio, superplasticizer, and gravel as the most significant factors influencing the CS of PAC. Furthermore, graphical user interface (GUI) have been developed for practical applications in predicting concrete strength. This simplifies the process and offers a valuable tool for leveraging the model's potential in the field of civil engineering. This comprehensive evaluation provides valuable insights to researchers and practitioners, empowering them to make informed choices in predicting PAC compressive strength in construction projects. By enhancing the reliability and applicability of predictive models, this study contributes to the field of preplaced aggregate concrete strength prediction.

AB  - Understanding the complex correlation between the built environment and subway passenger flow can provide unique insights for the development of transportation operations and urban coordination policies. Few studies have systematically analyzed the rationality of selecting built environment variables and further explored the non-linear relationships. In this study, we integrated various sources of built environmental factors and developed an interpretable machine learning analysis framework using backward elimination extreme gradient boosting and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values analysis (BE-XGBoost-SHAP). The framework was validated by analyzing passenger flows during the morning peak, non-peak, and evening peak periods at the station level. The research results indicate that there are significant differences between built environment factors and the time-varying passenger flow. Land use characteristics significantly dominate across all three temporal periods. The importance of other variable types in relation to passenger flows varies significantly across the three time periods. It is worth noting that the relationships between all variables and passenger flow at different time periods are non-linear, with the majority displaying threshold effects. Compared with the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) and ordinary least squares (OLS) models, the proposed interpretive framework performs better as regards R-square, root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) metrics. This study offers valuable insights, elucidating the pivotal land use attributes that notably affect passenger flow, the significance of varied built environment factors across distinct time spans, and the acknowledgment of non-linearities and threshold effects within these relationships. These findings are imperative for urban planning and the enhancement of station area design.

AB  - Mitigating severe losses caused by pluvial floods in urban areas with dense population and property requires effective flood prediction for emergency measures. Physics-based models face issues with low computational efficiency for real-time flood prediction. An alternative approach for rapid prediction instead of physics-based models is to predict from a data-driven perspective. However, data-driven approaches for urban flood prediction are often perceived as "black box" and might raise concerns. In this study, we propose an explainable deep learning (DL) approach for rapid urban pluvial flood prediction with enhanced transparency using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and the explainable artificial intelligence (AI) framework Shapley additive explanation (SHAP). We process a systematic stepwise feature selection process and establish a CNN model considering topography, drainage networks and rainfall to predict maximum inundation depths. Then, SHAP is applied to provide trustworthy explanations for the decision making in model results. The results show that: 1) Forward selection can offer insights into selecting effective input variables for improved predictions and promote understanding of DL modelling. The spatial pattern of inundation depths predicted by the proposed CNN model shows good agreement with those predicted by the physics-based model, demonstrated by average correlation coefficient (CC) and mean absolute error (MAE) values of 0.982 and 0.021 m, respectively. 2) The CNN model substantially outperforms the physics-based model in computational speed when using the same hardware, achieving speedups of 210 times on GPU and 51 times on CPU in the case study (575167 grid cells, 14.38 km2). Particularly, it can still achieve good performance on a CPU-only standard laptop without high-performance hardware, with only a modest increase in computational time. 3) The SHAP explainable analysis confirms that the CNN model correctly captures the relationships between input variables and water depth, revealing a reasonable decision-making process, enhancing its transparency. The explainable DL approach incorporating SHAP for rapid urban pluvial flood prediction is promising to build trust among stakeholders and provide a trustworthy reference for prompt measures aiming at saving lives and protecting assets during flood emergencies. Additionally, the proposed DL approach can potentially be further expanded to analyze the causes of urban flooding events and serve as a foundation for exploring the transferability of data-driven urban flood prediction, providing benefits for better urban flood risk management.

AB  - Agriculture is pivotal for the economy of a country as it is a major source of food, employment and raw materials. However, challenges such as diseases, soil degradation, and water scarcity persist. Technology adoption can address these issues, improving production and quality. Machine learning, a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI), enables prediction, classification, and automation in agriculture. It optimizes irrigation, fertilization, and crop selection, aiding decision-making for food security and crop management. This study proposes two robust machine learning architectures for classification and regression based on distinct datasets. Firstly, we delve into a crop recommendation dataset obtained from Kaggle, consisting of various input attributes such as the pH of the soil, temperature, humidity, and nutrient levels. Leveraging machine learning classification techniques such as Extra Tree Classifier (ETC), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), we suggest twenty-two different crops founded on these inputs. Through the use of K-fold cross-validation, Explainable AI (XAI) and feature engineering, we identify the best-performing model, with Random Forest coming out on top scoring an accuracy of 99.7% with precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix. Secondly, we investigate wheat yield prediction data snagged from the World Bank and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), covering the years 1992-2013 for Pakistan. Using Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) to tackle data restrictions, we gauge wheat production for 2014-2024 and forecast the 2025 yield using machine learning regression models. Once again, using hyper parameter tuning with K-fold cross-validation, Support Vector Regressor (SVR) stands out as the top-performing model, achieving an accuracy of 99.9% with R-2 Score. Transparency and confidence in agricultural decision-making are increased when machine learning decisions are made comprehensible using Explainable AI (XAI) approaches. Two widely used XAI approaches, namely Feature Importance and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) are used to interpret and explain outcomes of the proposed models. The study can increase agricultural productivity, minimize risks, enhance food security, and promote more environmentally friendly farming approaches.

AB  - There is a pressing need to study spatial heterogeneity of ridesourcing usage determinants to develop bettertargeted transportation and land use policies. This study incorporates spatial information (i.e., the geographic coordinates of census tracts) into the machine learning model and leverages state-of-the-art explainable machine learning techniques to analyze census-tract-to-census-tract ridesourcing usage, identify the key factors that shape the usage, and explore their nonlinear associations across different spatial contexts. Specifically, we analyze the spatial heterogeneity of ridesourcing travel in Chicago based on three spatial contexts, including downtown, neighborhood and airport. The results reveal that built environment variables collectively contribute to the largest importance for the downtown and airport context, while socioeconomic and demographic variables are the strongest predictors for the neighborhood context. Travel cost, the number of commuters and transit supply variables have evident nonlinear associations with ridesourcing usage, and these associations show strong differences across these three spatial contexts. Moreover, incorporating geographic coordinates is shown to be useful in improving model's capability to capture spatial information and thus enhance its predictive performance. These findings provide transportation professionals with location-based insights to better plan and manage ridesourcing services in Chicago.

AB  - Mitigation of the heat island effect is critical due to the frequency of extremely hot weather. Urban street greening can achieve this mitigation and improve the quality of urban spaces and people's welfare. However, a clear definition of street green space morphology is lacking, and the nonlinear mechanism of its cooling effect is still unclear; the interaction between street green space morphology and the surrounding built environment has not been investigated. This study used machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision methods to predict land surface temperature based on street green space morphology and the surrounding built environment. The performances of the XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost models were then compared, and the nonlinear cooling effects offered by the street green space morphology were analyzed using the Shapley method. The results show that streets with a high level of green environment exposure (GVI > 0.4, NDVI > 4) can accommodate more types of green space morphology while maintaining the cooling effect. Additionally, the proportion of vegetation with simple geometry (FI < 0.2), large leaves (FD < 0.65), light-colored leaves (CSI > 13), and high leaf density (TDE > 3) should be increased in streets with a low level of green environment exposure (GVI < 0.1, NDVI < 2.5). Meanwhile, streets with highly variable building heights (AFI > 1.5) or large areas covered by buildings (BC > 0.3) should increase large leaf vegetation (FD < 0.65) while decreasing dark leaf vegetation (CSI < 13). The study uses machine learning methods to construct a nonlinear cooling benefit model for street green space morphology, proposes design recommendations for different street green spaces that consider climate adaptation, and provides a reference for urban thermal environment regulation.

AB  - Background Systemic drug reaction (SDR) is a major safety concern with weekly rifapentine plus isoniazid for 12 doses (3HP) for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). Identifying SDR predictors and at-risk participants before treatment can improve cost-effectiveness of the LTBI program. Methods We prospectively recruited 187 cases receiving 3HP (44 SDRs and 143 non-SDRs). A pilot cohort (8 SDRs and 12 non-SDRs) was selected for generating whole-blood transcriptomic data. By incorporating the hierarchical system biology model and therapy-biomarker pathway approach, candidate genes were selected and evaluated using reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Then, interpretable machine learning models presenting as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values were applied for SDR risk prediction. Finally, an independent cohort was used to evaluate the performance of these predictive models. Results Based on the whole-blood transcriptomic profile of the pilot cohort and the RT-qPCR results of 2 SDR and 3 non-SDR samples in the training cohort, 6 genes were selected. According to SHAP values for model construction and validation, a 3-gene model for SDR risk prediction achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 0.972 and 0.947, respectively, under a universal cutoff value for the joint of the training (28 SDRs and 104 non-SDRs) and testing (8 SDRs and 27 non-SDRs) cohorts. It also worked well across different subgroups. Conclusions The prediction model for 3HP-related SDRs serves as a guide for establishing a safe and personalized regimen to foster the implementation of an LTBI program. Additionally, it provides a potential translational value for future studies on drug-related hypersensitivity.
   By integrating clinical samples, bioinformatic techniques, and explainable machine learning, we provide a blood-based prediction model to foresee rifapentine-based treatment-related systemic drug reaction, leading to increased public acceptance of public health policy on latent tuberculosis infection intervention.

AB  - In the automotive industry, cost estimation of components to be purchased plays an important role for price negotiations with suppliers and, therefore, for cost control within the supply chain. While traditional bottom-up cost estimation is a very time consuming and know-how intensive process, intelligent machine learning methods have the potential to significantly reduce the effort in the cost estimation process. In this paper, a literature review on intelligent cost estimation methods for parts to be procured in the manufacturing industry is carried out by text mining. Following the results of this literature review, building blocks for an intelligent cost esti-mation system are outlined that comprise cost estimation methods, dimensionality reduction methods, methods for multi-level cost estimation, and methods for interpreting the results of the cost analysis. Regarding cost estimation methods , Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines outperform established linear regression algorithms. Dimensionality reduction methods like Correlation Analysis or Principal Component Analysis are rarely studied . Nevertheless, they contribute a lot to the reduction of expensively provided input parameters for cost estimation. Methods for multi-level cost estimation, that support cost prediction of parts and assemblies following the construction plan of a vehicle, and methods for interpretation of intelligent cost ana-lytics cannot be found at all in literature. Consequently, in this paper corresponding approaches are derived from the areas of Multitask Learning and Explainable Machine Learning. Finally, a combination of methods considered most suitable for predictive analytics to estimate procurement costs is presented.

AB  - In recent years, fuzzy rule-based systems have been attracting great interest in interpretable and eXplainable Artificial Intelligence as ante-hoc methods. These systems represent knowledge that humans can easily understand, but since they are not interpretable per se , they must remain simple and understandable, and the rule base must have a compactness property. This article presents an algorithm for minimizing the fuzzy rule base, leveraging rough set theory and a greedy strategy. Reducing fuzzy rules simplifies the rule base, facilitating the construction of interpretable inference systems such as decision support and recommendation systems. Validation and comparison of the proposed methodology using both real and benchmark data yield encouraging results.

AB  - Background: Employee turnover poses a multi-faceted challenge to organizations by undermining productivity, morale, and financial stability while rendering recruitment, onboarding, and training investments wasteful. Traditional machine learning approaches often struggle with class imbalance and lack transparency, limiting actionable insights. This study introduces an Explainable AI (XAI) framework to achieve both high predictive accuracy and interpretability in turnover forecasting. Methods: Two publicly available HR datasets (IBM HR Analytics, Kaggle HR Analytics) were preprocessed with label encoding and MinMax scaling. Class imbalance was addressed via GAN-based synthetic data generation. A three-layer Transformer encoder performed binary classification, and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis provided both global and local feature attributions. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC metrics. Results: On the IBM dataset, the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) Transformer model achieved 92.00% accuracy, 96.67% precision, 87.00% recall, 91.58% F1, and 96.32% ROC AUC. On the Kaggle dataset, it reached 96.95% accuracy, 97.28% precision, 96.60% recall, 96.94% F1, and 99.15% ROC AUC, substantially outperforming classical resampling methods (ROS, SMOTE, ADASYN) and recent literature benchmarks. SHAP explanations highlighted JobSatisfaction, Age, and YearsWithCurrManager as top predictors in IBM and number project, satisfaction level, and time spend company in Kaggle. Conclusion: The proposed GAN Transformer SHAP pipeline delivers state-of-the-art turnover prediction while furnishing transparent, actionable insights for HR decision-makers. Future work should validate generalizability across diverse industries and develop lightweight, real-time implementations.

AB  - The detection of plant leaf diseases is essential for ensuring crop health and productivity. This study uses a comprehensive merged dataset, including the Mendeley Plant Leaf Dataset, which includes 22 classes, while the Jute and Mulberry datasets provide 2 classes each, representing healthy and diseased categories from various species. The final dataset, consisting of 26 classes, was augmented to ensure 500 training samples per class. In this study, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) was employed for zero-shot segmentation, enabling the automatic extraction of precise regions of interest (ROIs) from leaf images without the need for task-specific training for region-focused analysis. An EfficientNetB7- Multi-Head Attention (MHA) model that combines EfficientNetB7 with MHA was used to improve plant disease classification across 26 distinct classes. The proposed model is designed to handle the variety and diversity of leaf diseases, achieving a high classification accuracy of 98.01%, with precision, recall, and F1-scores all exceeding 97.9%. The integration of MHA allows the model to focus on disease-specific features, significantly enhancing its ability to generalize across diverse agricultural settings while maintaining scalability. Experimental results show that the EfficientNetB7-MHA model consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in terms of accuracy and robustness, making it a promising tool for precision agriculture. Explainable AI (XAI) including the use of Grad-CAM was utilized to detect the precise regions of interest for each class providing interpretability and insights into the model's decision-making process. Finally, to demonstrate the model's performance, a web application was developed that displays the predicted outputs when given different images of healthy and diseased leaves from the dataset. This comprehensive approach demonstrates significant potential for improving agricultural disease management through accurate, scalable, interpretable, and efficient disease detection.

AB  - In high-stakes project risk assessment, balancing predictive accuracy with interpretability is critical to fostering stakeholder trust and supporting well-informed decision-making. This study presents the Interpretable Risk Assessment Framework with Belief Rule-Based Systems (IRAF-BRB), an Explainable AI (XAI) framework specifically designed to improve transparency, accountability, and accuracy in risk assessment. IRAF-BRB combines Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) to map and analyze interdependencies among risk factors with an optimized Belief Rule-Based (BRB) model. A modified Differential Evolution Covariance Matrix Self-Adaptation (DECMSA) algorithm is employed to enhance the predictive power of the BRB model while preserving interpretability, ensuring that stakeholders can both trust and understand the model's outputs. By transforming complex risk data into intuitive visualizations, the IRAF-BRB framework enables project managers to identify key risk drivers and anticipate cascading effects, leading to proactive risk mitigation. Experimental results demonstrate that IRAF-BRB reduces Mean Squared Error (MSE) to 4.09e-4 in predicting risk levels for high-rise construction projects, outperforming traditional BRB models such as Differential Evolution-based BRB (DE-BRB) (8.29e-4) and Particle Swarm Optimization-based BRB (PSO-BRB) (2.53e-3). The statistical significance of these results was confirmed via a two-sample t-test (p < 0.05), establishing IRAF-BRB as a reliable and effective tool for accurate and interpretable risk assessment.

AB  - The operation of the subway system necessitates a comprehensive understanding of passenger flow characteristics at station locations, as well as a keen awareness of the average travel distances at these stations. Moreover, the travel distances at the station level bear a direct relationship with the built environment composed of land use characteristics within the station's catchment area. To this end, we selected the land use features within an 800 m radius of the station (land use area, distribution of points of interest, and the surrounding living environment) as the influencing factors, with the travel distances at peak hours on the subway network in Xi'an as the research subject. An improved SSA-XGBOOST-SHAP interpretable machine learning framework was established. The research findings demonstrate that the proposed enhanced model outperforms traditional machine learning or linear regression methods in terms of R-squared, MAE, and RMSE. Furthermore, the distance from the city center, road network density, the number of public transit routes, and the land use mix have a pronounced influence on travel distances, reflecting the significant impact that mature built environments can have on passenger attraction. Additionally, the analysis reveals a notable nonlinear relationship and threshold effect between the built environment variables comprising land use and the travel distances during peak hours. The research results provide data-driven support for operational strategy management and line capacity optimization, as well as theoretical underpinnings for enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of the entire subway system.

AB  - One of the fundamental challenges in managing software and information technology projects is monitoring and predicting project status at the end of each sprint, release or project. Agile project management has emerged over the past two decades, significantly impacting project success. However, no comprehensive approach based on the features of this approach has been found in studies to monitor and predict the status of a sprint, release or project. This study aims to develop a data-driven approach for predicting the status of software projects based on agility features. For this purpose, 22 agility features were first identified to evaluate and predict the status of projects in four aspects: Endurance, Effectiveness, Efficiency, and Complexity. The findings indicate that the aspects of Effectiveness and Efficiency have the greatest impact on project success. Additionally, the results show that features related to team work, team capacity, experience and project objectives have the most significant impact on project success. An artificial neural network algorithm was then used, and a model was developed to predict project status, which was optimized using the Neural Architecture Search algorithm with a 93 percent accuracy rate. The neural network model was interpreted using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm, and sensitivity analysis was performed on the important components. Finally, the behavior of the projects in each category was analyzed and evaluated using the Apriori algorithm.

AB  - The dynamic patterns of leisure jogging profile the jogger-environment interactions. However, the dynamic patterns and their nonlinear associations with environmental factors are poorly explored. Therefore, we develop a framework to uncover the dynamic jogging patterns and interpret their nonlinear and interactive associations with environments. Initially, the bivariate time series clustering method discerns daily and weekly patterns from the integrated jogging flow and duration. Then, interpretable machine learning methods including CatBoost, SHAP, and ALE plots elucidate the nonlinear and interactive relationships. An empirical analysis of Beijing, China was conducted using multisource data. Our finding highlights that (1) five distinct daily and weekly jogging patterns were investigated for area zoning. These patterns show notable spatial-temporal disparities in jogging flow and duration. (2) Built environment (BE) and visual environment are crucial in shaping jogging, with accessibility and facilities being significant contributors. (3) Environmental variables show significant nonlinear and threshold effects on leisure jogging, which vary across jogging patterns and urban areas. (4) Interaction effects among environmental factors were investigated. BE factors like sports amenity exert more significant interactions. Importantly, incorporating geographic locations enhances model performance as it captures spatial effects. These findings can help planners design refined intervention strategies for leisure activities.

AB  - Ensuring compliance with total phosphorus (TP) discharge standards is essential in wastewater sector to alleviate eutrophication. This study focused on optimizing chemical removal of TP from a typical wastewater plant (WWTP) where poly aluminum chloride (PAC) is used after anaerobic-anoxic-oxic technology. With PAC consumption and TP removal in one-year daily data combined as input-output system, binary classifications of decoupling and congestion patterns representing elasticity and productivity were conducted to mitigate irregular data mappings caused by inaccurate dosing. Through interpretable machine learning (IML) modeling, influent conditions were recognized as significant factors. Biochemical oxygen demand to TP ratio exceeding 36.07 and loading capacity rates departing 99.46 %similar to 106.64 % increased decoupled and congested probability. These findings highlighted the adjust on PAC dosage for redundancy prevention according to varied influent conditions. The evaluation and modeling workflow with IML emphasized the need for systematic optimization to achieve sustainable WWTP operations and low-carbon development in wastewater sector.

KW  - WORK
AB  - Deep Learning (DL) models, widely used in several domains, are often applied for posture recognition. This work researches five DL architectures for posture recognition: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Transformer, hybrid CNN-LSTM, and hybrid CNN-Transformer. Agriculture and construction working postures were addressed as use cases, by acquiring an inertial dataset during the simulation of their typical tasks in circuits. Since model performance greatly depends on the choice of the hyperparameters, a grid search was conducted to find the optimal hyperparameters. An extensive analysis of the hyperparameter combinations' effects is presented, identifying some general tendencies. Moreover, to unveil the black-box DL models, we applied the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) explainability method on CNN's outputs to better understand the model's decision-making, in terms of the most important sensors and time steps for each window output. Innovative hybrid architectures combining CNN and LSTM or Transformer encoder were implemented, by using the convolution feature maps as LSTM's or Transformer's inputs and fusing both subnetworks' outputs with weights learned during the training. All architectures successfully recognized the eight posture classes, with the best model of each architecture exceeding 91.5% F1-score in the test. Atop F1-score of 94.33%, with an inference time of just 0.29 ms (in a regular laptop), was achieved by a hybrid CNN-Transformer.

AB  - As deep learning has been successfully deployed in diverse applications, there is an ever increasing need to explain its decision. To explain decisions, case-based reasoning has proved to be effective in many areas. The prototype-based explanation is a method that provides an explanation of the model's prediction using the distance between an input and learned prototypes to effectively perform case-based reasoning. However, existing methods are less reliable because distance is not always consistent with human perception. In this study, we construct a latent space which we call an $explanation space$ with distributional embedding and latent space regularization. This explanation space ensures that similar (in terms of human-interpretable features) images share similar latent representations, and therefore provides a reliable explanation for the consistency between distance-based explanation and human perception. The explanation space also provides additional explanation by transition, allowing the user to understand the factors that affect the distance. Throughout extensive experiments including human evaluation, we have shown that the explanation space provides a more human-understandable explanation.

AB  - Exploring and analyzing safety influencing factors can guide targeted traffic safety management. Traditional traffic safety models are aimed at specific data problems and making adjustments to the model structure, which lack focus on predictive ability and have limited information on the analysis of influencing factors. In recent years, machine-learning methods have opened new avenues in modeling that have higher prediction accuracy, can identify complex nonlinear relationships, and can overcome over- and under-dispersion and correlation. Machine-learning methods, however, pose the problem of limited interpretability. The interpretable machine-learning framework SHAP can be an effective solution, which can not only reflect the influence of features in each sample but also generate global interpretation. This study established gradient boosting models including the CatBoost and XGBoost models as traffic safety models, which were compared with a traditional NB regression model and a zero-inflated negative binomial regression model. SHAP was used to analyze several safety influencing factors, including geometric design features, traffic operation characteristics, time of day, and land use. Results confirmed that the CatBoost model has better prediction ability and is a more suitable traffic safety model than the traditional negative binomial regression model. Among the key findings were that ramp type is the most important factor in freeway crash frequency; curve presence has a great positive impact, while truck proportion has a great negative impact; and traffic volume is highly correlated with truck proportion. These findings can provide theoretical support for safety operation management and targeted improvement measures for freeways.

AB  - Pluvial flash floods are fast-moving hazards and causes significant disruptions in urban areas. With the increase in heavy precipitations, the ability to proactively identify flash floods hotspots in cities is critical for flood nowcasting and predictive monitoring of risks. While rainfall runoff models and hydrologic models are useful models for flash flood prediction, these models are computationally expensive and effort intensive to be used for flood nowcasting. To address this challenge, this study presents interpretable machine learning models for predicting urban flash flood hotspots based on intertwined land and built environment features. The task of predicting flash flood hotspots is formulated as a binary classification problem, and three recent flash flood events in U.S. cities are selected for data collection and model validation. Various features related to land and built environment characteristics are constructed using diverse datasets, and the occurrences of flash floods are captured using crowdsource data from the events. Using these features and datasets, the flash flood hotspots of cities are predicted with two ensemble models based on decision trees. The results demonstrate that the models can achieve good accuracy (0.8) in identifying flooded/non-flooded locations. Especially, the models can achieve high true positive rate (0.83-0.89) and low missing rate, demonstrating the methods' practicability for accurately predicting flooded hotspots. The model interpretation results indicate that land features related to hydrological and topological features have greater impacts on flash flood risk, than built environment features. Further analysis reveals that the feature importance, model performance, and model transferability performance vary among cities and localized specifications of the models are needed for accurate prediction of flash flood for a particular city. The data-driven machine learning models presented in this study provide a useful tool for predicting flash flood hotspots based on the intertwined features of land and the built environment in cities to enable nowcasting and proactive monitoring of flash flood hotspots for emergency response and also inform integrated urban design and development towards flash flood risk reduction.

AB  - Five homologous lotus parts, namely, the leaf, stamen, plumule, flower and leaf base, are all ancient nutrient sources, but their chemical differences are poorly understood. Identification of these parts of origin could contribute to determining reasonable edible and/or medicinal applications without misuse/waste risk. The present work aimed to investigate the feasibility of using metabolic profiles coupled with explainable machine learning (ML) for tracing lotus parts of origin. Assisted with molecular networking, 151 compounds were systematically annotated through an untargeted metabolomics approach. Twenty-eight representative constituents were subsequently quantified for the construction of the ML algorithm. Because most ML algorithms are datadriven black boxes with opaque inner workings, the SHaply Additive exPlanation technique was innovatively used to understand model outputs. By offering an integral analytical platform for phytochemical characterization and information interpretation, these results could serve as a basis for an explainable tool for identification of the specific lotus part of origin.

AB  - Evidence has shown the importance of built environment features in shaping park use and physical activity behaviour. However, it is unclear what impacts built environment features within and around parks have on older adults' park visits. To address this gap, this study employs an interpretable machine learning model to investigate a variety of built environment features within and around parks and their association with devicemeasured park visits of older adults. We found that macroscale built environment features around parks (i.e. intersection density) had an important role in shaping older adults' park visits and were generally more important than microscale built environment features within (i.e. amenities) and around parks (i.e. park access). Additionally, the macroscale built environment features of neighbourhoods were more predictive of older adults' park visits than those of park buffers. Among the microscale built environment features studied, park sports facilities appear to be the most influential, followed by aesthetic features. Research findings suggest that key built environment features influence older adults' park visits in combination, highlighting the importance of a more holistic perspective when considering built environment influences on behaviour, including understanding the wider neighbourhood context of parks, and integrating such perspectives in future research and policymaking.

AB  - Following the emergence of cryptocurrencies, the field of digital assets experienced a sudden explosion of interest among institutional investors. However, regarding ICOs, there were a lot of scams involving the disappearance of firms after they had collected significant amounts of funds. We study how well one can predict if an offering will turn out to be a scam, doing so based on the characteristics known ex-ante. We therefore examine which of these characteristics are the most important predictors of a scam, and how they influence the probability of a scam. We use detailed data with 160 features from about 300 ICOs that took place before March 2018 and succeeded in raising most of their required capital. Various machine learning algorithms are applied together with novel XAI tools in order to identify the most important predictors of an offering's failure and understand the shape of relationships. It turns out that based on the features known ex-ante, one can predict a scam with an accuracy of about 65-70%, and that nonlinear machine learning models perform better than traditional logistic regression and its regularized extensions.

AB  - In this case study, we introduce two ML techniques, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and an optimized Random Forest (RF), to address challenges related to capacity and cost, by addressing problems of unscheduled downtime and Process Time (PT) variation in the case of a complex chamber processing tool. We show that by using these ML techniques, traditional methods of Predictive Maintenance (PdM) and PT analysis can be enhanced with new insights and lead to significant productivity improvements. We demonstrate that, with these methods, by detecting states and attributes of the tool, trends in the tool's behavior can be more effectively identified to reduce its unscheduled downtime and improve its run-rate, thereby resulting in significant capacity and cost improvements. This is achieved by reducing the variability of availability; extending the Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF); and removing variability in PT between lots and chambers.

AB  - Machine learning and deep learning have significantly enhanced the ability to mitigate risks in blast-based tunnel construction. However, most studies fall short in model constraints, data quality, and explainability, making nonrobust risk mitigation strategies. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the following questions: how to accurately assess risk for blast-based tunnel construction using limited data, and develop effective risk mitigation strategies? This research leverages counterfactual explanation generation, a key technique of explainable artificial intelligence, along with data augmentation to develop a framework for guiding risk mitigation, which includes: (1) a two-stage data augmentation technique to address data shortage and imbalance; (2) a novel counterfactual explanation generation algorithm to optimize blasting parameters and reduce risk; and (3) a post-hoc explainable approach to provide insights on feature importance. A railway tunnel in Hubei is conducted as a case study to test the validity of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method accurately predict overbreak, achieving the highest R2 (0.883) and the lowest RMSE (1.335) compared to baseline models. Additionally, it effectively optimizes the blasting parameters to mitigate risk, reducing the average overbreak in six scenarios. The explainable analytic identifies key factors (e.g., periphery hole spacing) influencing construction risk, thereby enhancing personnel's understanding of complex construction systems.

AB  - Large-Scale Travelling Ionospheric Disturbances (LSTIDs) are wave-like ionospheric fluctuations, generally triggered by geomagnetic storms, which play a critical role in space weather dynamics. In this work, we present a machine learning model able to forecast the occurrence of LSTIDs over the European continent up to three hours in advance. The model is based on CatBoost, a gradient boosting framework. It is trained on a human-validated LSTID catalogue with the various physical drivers, including ionogram information, geomagnetic, and solar activity indices. There are three forecasting modes depending on the demanded scenarios with varying relative costs of false positives and false negatives. It is crucial to make the model predictions explainable, so that the output contribution of each physical factor input is visualised through the game-theoretic SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) formalism. The validation procedure consists of a global-level evaluation and interpretation step, firstly, followed by an event-level validation against independent detection methods, which highlights the model's predictive robustness and suggests its potential for real-time space weather forecasting. Depending on the operating mode, we report an improvement ranging from +72% to +93% over the performance of a rule-based benchmark. Our study concludes with a comprehensive analysis of future research directions and actions to be taken towards full operability. We discuss probabilistic forecasting approaches from a cost-sensitive learning perspective, along with performance-centric model monitoring. Finally, through the lens of the conformal prediction framework, we further comment on the uncertainty quantification for end-user risk management and mitigation.

AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) plays a crucial role in the hydrological cycle, significantly impacting agricultural productivity and water resource management, particularly in water-scarce areas. This study explores the effects of key climate variables temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, wind speed, and humidity on ET from 2000 to 2020, with forecasts extended to 2030. Advanced data preprocessing techniques, including Yeo-Johnson and Box-Cox transformations, Savitzky-Golay smoothing, and outlier elimination, were applied to improve data quality. Datasets from MODIS, TRMM, GLDAS, and ERA5 were utilized to enhance model accuracy. The predictive performance of various time series forecasting models, including Prophet, SARIMA, STL + ARIMA, TBATS, ARIMAX, and ETS, was systematically evaluated. This study also introduces novel algorithms for Explainable AI (XAI) and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), enhancing the interpretability of model predictions and improving understanding of how climate variables affect ET. This comprehensive methodology not only accurately forecasts ET but also offers a transparent approach to understanding climatic effects on ET. The results indicate that Prophet and ETS models demonstrate superior prediction accuracy compared to other models. The ETS model achieved the lowest Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values of 0.60 for precipitation, 0.51 for wind speed, and 0.48 for solar radiation. Prophet excelled with the lowest Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values of 0.62 for solar radiation, 0.67 for wind speed, and 0.74 for precipitation. SHAP analysis indicates that temperature has the strongest impact on ET predictions, with SHAP values ranging from -1.5 to 1.0, followed by wind speed (-0.75 to 0.75) and solar radiation (-0.5 to 0.5).

AB  - Satellite global digital elevation models (GDEMs) suffer from positive biases in urban areas due to building artifacts. While various machine learning (ML)-based methods have been proposed to remove these biases, their generalizability is limited by spatial heterogeneity and redundancy in prediction factors across different regions. Therefore, to investigate the spatial heterogeneity of prediction factors and address the problem of factor redundancy in ML-based model prediction, this paper proposes an explainable artificial intelligence framework (XAI) for correcting urban GDEMs using the SHapley additive explanation (SHAP)-random forest (RF) algorithm. The performance of the proposed model for correcting the 30-m COPDEM (COPDEM30) was demonstrated in New York City. The results were compared with the first global Forests-And-Buildings removed DEM (FABDEM) and three classical RF-based models without considering spatial heterogeneity and (or) factor optimization. The results indicate that each factor contributes differently to the correction of COPDEM30 across the regions, showing distinct regional characteristics and spatial heterogeneity. The constructed model is more applicable to regions with similar features to the training regions. In comparison to the three traditional RF-based models in areas with training points, the proposed method obtains the high accuracy. Specifically, while the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values of the classical RF models ranged between 2.601 m and 2.724 m, and 1.686 m and 1.785 m, respectively, the proposed method achieves an RMSE of 2.258 m and an MAE of 1.436 m. Moreover, the proposed method reduces the RMSE (MAE) of the original COPDEM30 from 7.652 m (4.858 m) to 3.797 m (2.404 m), when applied to an area without providing training points. In summary, the XAI framework based on SHAP-RF can effectively quantify the contribution of prediction factors on GDEM correction, both globally and locally, which is conducive to the construction and improvement of the prediction factor system for urban GDEM correction in different regions. It also provides a reference for improving the performance of ML-based spatial prediction in geosciences.

AB  - The use of naturally available materials such as metakaolin (MK) can greatly reduce the utilization of emission intensive materials like cement in the construction sector. This would reduce the stress on depleting natural resources and foster a sustainable construction industry. However, the laboratory determination of 28 day compressive strength (C-S) of MK-based mortar is associated with several time and resource constraints. Thus, this study was conducted to develop reliable empirical prediction models to assess CS of MK-based mortar from its mixture proportion using machine learning algorithms like gene expression programming (GEP), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), multi expression programming (MEP), bagging regressor (BR), and AdaBoost etc. A comprehensive dataset compiled from published literature having five input parameters including water-to-binder ratio, mortar age, and maximum aggregate diameter etc. was used for this purpose. The developed models were validated by means of error metrics, residual assessment, and external validation checks which revealed that XGB is the most accurate algorithm having testing \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\:{\text{R}}<^>{2}$$\end{document} of 0.998 followed by BR having \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\:{\text{R}}<^>{2}$$\end{document} values equal to 0.946 while MEP had the lowest testing \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\:{\text{R}}<^>{2}$$\end{document} of 0.893. However, MEP and GEP algorithms expressed their output in the form of empirical equations which other black-box algorithms couldn't produce. Moreover, interpretable machine learning approaches including shapely additive explanatory analysis (SHAP), individual conditional expectation (ICE), and partial dependence plots (PDP) were conducted on the XGB model which highlighted that water-to-binder ratio and sample age are some of the most significant variables to predict the C-S of MK-based cement mortars. Finally, a graphical user interface (GUI) was made for implementation of findings of this study in the civil engineering industry.

AB  - Since Jane Jacobs introduced the concept of urban vibrancy in 1961, it has become a focal point of multidisciplinary research. However, existing literature lacks further exploration of intra-city differences. Therefore, this study uses Guangzhou as a case study, with HD and CBD as comparison groups, to comprehensively measure urban vibrancy and quantify its associations with built environment factors. First, urban vibrancy is measured using multi-source big data across four dimensions: population, facilities, social media, and offline consumption. Second, the XGBoost and SHAP-based interpretation with regional pooled modeling are employed to analyze the nonlinear and threshold effects of built environment factors on vibrancy. The results indicate: (1) The comprehensive vibrancy of CBD is slightly higher than that of HD. (2) Population density and the number of caterings are key factors in both HD and CBD. (3) The impact trends of the same variables on urban vibrancy in HD and CBD are similar, yet the threshold effects differ significantly. This study contributes by dissecting the vibrancy differences between areas with different functions and historical contexts within a city. The findings suggest that urban planners and scholars should acknowledge intra-city vibrancy differences and pay attention to the nonlinear and threshold effects of urban vibrancy mechanisms.

AB  - The built environment affects mental health outcomes, but this relationship is less studied and understood. This article proposes a novel multi-level scenario-based predictive analytics framework (MSPAF) to explore the complex relationships between community mental health outcomes and the built environment conditions. The MSPAF combines rigorously validated interpretable machine learning algorithms and scenario-based sensitivity analysis to test various hypotheses on how the built environment impacts community mental health outcomes across the largest metropolitan areas in the US. Among other findings, our results suggest that declining socio-economic conditions of the built environment (e.g., poverty, low income, unemployment, decreased access to public health insurance) are significantly associated with increased reported mental health disorders. Similarly, physical conditions of the built environment (e.g., increased housing vacancies and increased travel costs) are significantly associated with increased reported mental health disorders. However, this positive relationship between the physical conditions of the built environment and mental health outcomes does not hold across all the metropolitan areas, suggesting a mixed effect of the built environment's physical conditions on community mental health. We conclude by highlighting future opportunities of incorporating other variables and datasets into the MSPAF framework to test additional hypotheses on how the built environment impacts community mental health.

AB  - The complexity of urban street vitality is reflected in the interaction of multiple factors. A deep understanding of the multi-dimensional driving mechanisms behind it is crucial to enhancing urban street vitality. However, existing studies lack comprehensive interpretative analyses of urban multi-source data, making it difficult to uncover these drivers' nonlinear relationships and interaction effects fully. This study introduces an interpretable machine learning framework, using Nanchang, China as a case study. It utilizes urban multi-source data to explore how these variables influence different dimensions of street vitality. This study's innovation lies in employing an integrated measurement approach which reveals the complex nonlinearities and interaction effects between data, providing a more comprehensive explanation. The results not only demonstrate the strong explanatory power of the measurement approach but also reveal that (1) built environment indicators play a key role in influencing street vitality, showing significant spatial positive correlations; (2) different dimensions of street vitality exhibit nonlinear characteristics, with transit station density being the most influential one; and (3) cluster analysis revealed distinct built environment and socioeconomic characteristics across various street vitality types. This study provides urban planners with a data-driven quantitative tool to help formulate more effective strategies for enhancing street vitality.

AB  - The demand for urban public transport is closely associated with the built environment, as analysed at both the city and neighbourhood levels. Although neighbourhood-level built environments have been studied thoroughly, city-level factors have received less attention. In this study, a machine learning framework is developed to explore the influence of multilevel factors on public transport commuting. A case study of 79 cities in mainland China reveals: (1) The highest accuracy was achieved by incorporating individual socioeconomic and commuting characteristics, and neighbourhood-and city-level built environments. (2) The cumulative importance of built environment factors exceeds 50%, with approximately half contributed by city-level variables. (3) All level factors exhibit nonlinear effects, with some variables displaying threshold effects. (4) Cities are classified into five distinct groups based on city-level variable effects. These findings highlight the necessity of incorporating multi-level factors into planning practices and targeted policy recommendations for different types of cities.

AB  - Violent crime poses a significant barrier to the equitable use of urban park amenities and access to their associated benefits. While machine learning has emerged as a promising tool for exploring the relationship between park environments and crime, the opaque nature of many models has hindered insights into underlying mechanisms. Moreover, most existing studies have concentrated on parks in central urban areas, overlooking peri-urban parks that increasingly serve expanding metropolitan populations. To address these gaps, this study employs an interpretable machine learning approach, XGBoost with SHAP values, to examine how the environments of both urban and peri-urban parks in Wuhan, China, influence violent crime. We assess four domains of contextual variables: accessibility, built environment, land use, and socioeconomic conditions. Results indicate that while violent crime rates are generally higher in urban parks, park location itself is not a significant standalone predictor. Both accessibility and built environment factors demonstrate nonlinear and context-sensitive associations with violent crime. Despite the potential of environmental design in crime prevention, disadvantaged neighborhoods remain disproportionately affected by unsafe park conditions. These findings highlight the need for place-sensitive planning strategies and demonstrate the value of interpretable machine learning in advancing spatial crime analysis.

AB  - Active travel, namely walking and cycling, is an eco-friendly and socially beneficial mode of sustainable transportation. However, existing research on active travel relies on limited survey data and generalized linear models. To fill the gap, our study integrates large-scale big trip data and data-driven machine learning to simultaneously predict active travel flow and probability. We employ SHapley Additive exPlanation to analyze the nonlinear effects of various characteristics (e.g., travel, socioeconomic, infrastructure, environment) on active travel. Gradient Boosting Decision Tree performs best for both prediction tasks. The overall importance of travel distance is over 50% to the model. Features like crow-fly distance, housing price, point-of-interest density, subway proximity, building area/road density, and urban greenery exhibit pronounced nonlinear effects. Local interpretability analysis reveals the determinants of specific trips, facilitating targeted optimization implications. Our study reveals the drivers and nonlinearities of active travel behavior and aids sustainable transportation planning.

AB  - The expansion of e-scooter sharing system has introduced several novel interactions within the existing transportation system. However, few studies have explored how spatial contexts influence these interactions. To fill this gap, this study explored the spatial heterogeneity in e-scooter's relationship with ridesourcing using data from Chicago, IL. We developed a Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) to estimate e-scooter sharing usage using ridesourcing trips along with associated built environment and socio-demographic variables. The model was interpreted using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Results indicated that the threshold effects, where the positive relationship between e-scooter sharing and ridesourcing significantly weakened beyond a certain value, were more pronounced in areas with lower population density, fewer jobs, and fewer young, highly educated population. This is primarily attributed to the limited competitiveness of e-scooter sharing in these areas. These findings can assist cities in harmonizing e-scooter sharing and ridesourcing thus promoting sustainable transportation systems.

AB  - This study investigated the influence of built environment features on crosswalk safety in dense urban settings, with a focus on visual streetscape characteristics extracted from street-view imagery using both semantic and instance segmentation. It used data from 36,750 crosswalks in Seoul, South Korea, to rigorously evaluate multiple machine learning algorithms for predicting pedestrian crash risk. Among the models assessed, the Random forest (RF) demonstrated the highest precision, aligning with the objective of enhancing pedestrian safety through accurate risk identification. The RF model enhanced by SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) achieved strong predictive performance (precision: 0.91), and SHAP analysis identified visual features, particularly sky openness ratio, building coverage, and sidewalk ratio, as influential factors affecting crash risk. A lower sky openness ratio combined with a higher building ratio was associated with increased crash likelihood, whereas greater sidewalk coverage and the presence of traffic control measures, including traffic lights and crosswalk time indicators, mitigated risk. Interaction effects further highlighted the complexity of urban safety, showing that combinations of streetscape and infrastructural elements can amplify or reduce hazards. These results highlight the importance of combining visual and structural data for thorough risk assessment and further the use of interpretable machine learning in urban safety research. The findings imply that to address particular combinations of built environment elements that increase the risk of crosswalk crashes, policy and planning initiatives should concentrate on context-sensitive interventions, particularly by placing bus stops strategically, maintaining tree canopies for visibility, clearing visual clutter, and improving pedestrian infrastructure.

AB  - The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and smart technologies into safety management is a pivotal aspect of the Fourth Industrial Revolution or Industry 4.0. This study conducts a systematic literature review to identify and analyze how AI and smart technologies enhance safety management across various sectors within the Safety 4.0 paradigm. Focusing on peer-reviewed journal articles that explicitly mention "Smart", "AI", or "Artificial Intelligence" in their titles, the research examines key safety management factors, such as accident prevention, risk management, real-time monitoring, and ethical implementation, across sectors, including construction, industrial safety, disaster and public safety, transport and logistics, energy and power, health, smart home and living, and other diverse industries. AI-driven solutions, such as predictive analytics, machine learning algorithms, IoT sensor integration, and digital twin models, are shown to proactively identify and mitigate potential hazards, optimize energy consumption, and enhance operational efficiency. For instance, in the energy and power sector, intelligent gas meters and automated fire suppression systems manage gas-related risks effectively, while in the health sector, AI-powered health monitoring devices and mental health support applications improve patient and worker safety. The analysis reveals a significant trend towards shifting from reactive to proactive safety management, facilitated by the convergence of AI with IoT and Big Data analytics. Additionally, ethical considerations and data privacy emerge as critical challenges in the adoption of AI technologies. The study highlights the transformative role of AI in enhancing safety protocols, reducing accident rates, and improving overall safety outcomes across industries. It underscores the need for standardized protocols, robust AI governance frameworks, and interdisciplinary research to address existing challenges and maximize the benefits of AI in safety management. Future research directions include developing explainable AI models, enhancing human-AI collaboration, and fostering global standardization to ensure the responsible and effective implementation of AI-driven safety solutions.

AB  - Damage assessment applied to reinforced concrete elements is one of the main activities of infrastructure maintenance tasks. Among these elements, the problem of corrosion in reinforced concrete is particularly critical and requires careful consideration. Annually, governments invest a large amount of economic resources in this activity. However, most methodologies for damage assessment rely on visual inspection, which may be subjectively interpreted, producing inconsistent results and requiring a considerable amount of time and resources. This study evaluates the performance of real-time object detection using You Only Look Once, version 3, for detecting corrosion damage in concrete structures. The architecture of YOLOv3 is based on a complex, but efficient, convolutional neural network fed by a dataset proposed and labeled by the authors. Two training stages were established to improve the model precision, using transfer learning with medium- and high-resolution training images. The test results show satisfactory concrete-corrosion detection through validation photographs and videos demonstrating the capabilities of explainable artificial intelligence and its applications in civil engineering.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) methods are becoming widespread, especially when data are not sufficient to build classical statistical models, as is the case for cyber risk management. However, when applied to regulated industries, such as energy, finance, and health, AI methods lack explainability. Authorities aimed at validating machine learning models in regulated fields will not consider black-box models, unless they are supplemented with further methods that explain why certain predictions have been obtained, and which are the variables that mostly concur to such predictions. Recently, Shapley values have been introduced for this purpose: They are model agnostic, and powerful, but are not normalized and, therefore, cannot become a standardized procedure. In this paper, we provide an explainable AI model that embeds Shapley values with a statistical normalization, based on Lorenz Zonoids, particularly suited for ordinal measurement variables that can be obtained to assess cyber risk.

AB  - Construction land, as the primary carrier of human industrial, residential, and transportation activities, represents a major source of carbon emissions. Exploring the impact of different types of construction land on carbon emissions is of critical importance for carbon reduction. Existing literature typically assesses the influence of different construction land types on carbon emissions at the block scale. While the block-scale analysis is limited by local environmental, complicating broader spatial impact assessments. In this study, we adopt advanced land use data from China's Third National Land Survey to measure the broad impact of different types of construction land on carbon emissions at county scale. The interpretable machine learning method was employed to analyze the global, local, and interactive effects of these construction land categories on carbon emissions. Our findings reveal that commercial, industrial, and residential lands exhibit positive associations with carbon emissions, while public facilities, special-use, and transportation lands demonstrate inhibitory effects. Importantly, the impact of construction land on emissions displays significant spatial heterogeneity. Industrial and commercial lands predominantly influence emissions in developed areas, whereas residential land's impact is more pronounced in developing regions. Furthermore, we observe that interactions between most types of construction land can inhibit carbon emissions, suggesting potential synergies in land use planning for emission reduction. These findings contribute to the broader understanding of how land use patterns influence carbon emissions and can inform more effective, targeted approaches to sustainable urban development and climate change mitigation.

AB  - Eucommia ulmoides, a plant native to China, is valued for its medicinal properties and has applications in food, health products, and traditional Chinese medicine. Processed Eucommiae Cortex (EC) has historically been a highly valued medicine. Ancient doctors had ample experience processing EC, especially with ginger juice, as documented in traditional Chinese medical texts. The combination of EC and ginger juice helps release and transform the active ingredients, strengthening the medicine's effectiveness and improving its taste and shelf life. However, the lack of quality control standards for Ginger-Eucommiae Cortex (G-EC), processed from EC and ginger, presents challenges for its industrial and clinical use. This study optimized G-EC processing using the CRITIC and Box-Behnken methods. Metabolomics showed 517 chemical changes between raw and processed GEC, particularly an increase in coniferyl aldehyde (CFA). Explainable artificial intelligence techniques revealed the feasibility of using color to CFA content, providing insights into quality indicators.

AB  - The geographical origin of sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicas plays an important role in determining its market value. This study investigated the feasibility of using multi-element profile combined with explainable machine learning to trace the origin of sea cucumber in China. Multi-element profile (23 elements) of 167 sea cucumber samples was determined with ICP-OES and ICP-MS, and used for construction and evaluation of 4 ensemble learning models. Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model achieved superior performance with an overall accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score and AUC as 0.95, 0.93, 0.91 and 1, respectively. The Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) algorithm was subsequently applied to interpret the XGBoost model output for desirable geographical information. Se was identified as the most important elemental marker for discriminating sea cu-cumber origins. Therefore, with clarified scientific support, multi-element profile combined with machine learning model could serve as a powerful tool for identifying the provenance of sea cucumber.

AB  - The construction industry, as a major global energy consumer and carbon emitter, plays a crucial role in achieving global sustainability. A key strategy for the green transformation of this industry-without compromising development-involves fostering green technology innovation. Nevertheless, existing studies exhibit a notable gap in identifying and evaluating potential green technology innovation opportunities within the construction field, leading to a scarcity of decision-making information for governments and innovation entities during the research and development stage. Recognizing this, our study proposes a two-stage technology opportunity prediction approach based on interpretable machine learning from the perspective of technology convergence. Diverging from previous methods, it not only predicts the probability of technology opportunity occurrence but also forecasts the technical impact of convergence opportunities. By analysing 600,442 patent documents in the green and construction fields, we identify 305 high-potential technology convergence opportunities. Our results reveal that technologies such as carbon capture and storage, pollution alarms, solar energy, forestry techniques, wind energy, energy-saving methods, and waste materials for water treatment have significant potential for convergence with construction technologies. Additionally, we analyse the influencing factors behind these convergence innovations, finding that technical similarity and proximity play crucial roles. These findings provide robust decision support for governments and industry stakeholders in formulating scientifically grounded green technology innovation strategies, thereby accelerating the green transformation of the construction industry and contributing to the goal of sustainable development.

AB  - In a container terminal, the length of time that containers remain in the yard, known as Container Dwell Time (CDT), is considered one of the significant operational indicators due to its direct correlation with terminal productivity and efficiency. However, due to complex processing procedure and the involvement of various logistics stakeholders, CDT is subject to high uncertainty, making it more difficult for the terminal to manage. To address this issue, this paper presents a comprehensive framework to identify the Key Factors (KFs) influencing prolongation of CDT for import containers. In order to elucidate abnormal cases from dataset which contains yard loading information, the Process Mining (PM) method is utilized. Subsequently, XAI has been utilized to identify the KFs of import CDT. To reflect reality as closely as possible, we collected event data from a container terminal in Busan, Korea. Based on experiments, the KFs thus identified were: 1) Temperature, 2) Weight of container, 3) Voyage number of container 4) Block, 5) Shipping company, and 6) Month of discharging. To conclude, we formulated domain knowledge-based interpretations of the six most influential KFs.

AB  - Glass powder concrete (GPC) holds the potential to reduce the damaging impact of construction industry on the natural environment by cutting down the amounts of cement and natural aggregates used in concrete. However, it requires having reliable ways for predicting key properties of GPC such as compressive strength (CS). The laboratory determination of GPC strength comes with various resource and time limitations due to which this study focused on using advanced machine learning (ML) techniques for predicting CS. Four algorithms including Multi Expression Programming (MEP), AdaBoost, HistGBR, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) were used for this purpose on a database retrieved from literature published internationally. The mixture composition of GPC like glass powder content, water-to-cement ratio, sand content along with concrete age etc. were used as predictors while CS was the only outcome. The algorithm's performance was validated by several techniques including k-fold cross validation, scatter plots, and residual distribution. Different error evaluation metrics were also utilized which revealed that XGB had the superior accuracy compared to its counterparts with a testing coefficient of determination (R2) value equal to 0.993. In contrast, MEP depicted its outcome as an equation which XGB and all the other algorithms could not provide. Moreover, interpretable ML techniques like shapely and Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) analysis were employed for investigation of the significance and relationships between inputs and the predicted outcome. Furthermore, a graphical user interface has been developed which will enable the professionals in the civil engineering industry to utilize the findings of this study seamlessly.

AB  - plays a vital role in the food stock. But sometimes this crop leaf falls into disease. And, the amount of food consumed will decrease due to leaf disease. So, discovering the rice leaf disease is necessary to improve rice productivity. Currently, many researchers use deep learning methods to solve this problem. Unfortunately, their research results were less accurate. In this paper, we construct transfer learning models to diagnose and categorize illnesses affecting rice leaves. To further improve the model performance, we construct three ensemble learning models to combine various architectures. In order to bring transparency to the disease diagnostic process, we explore the explainable AI (XAI) problem of the visual object detector and integrate Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad- CAM) into three ensemble models to generate explanations for individual object detections for assessing performance. The results of Ensemble Learning indicate that merging different architectures can be effective in disease diagnosis, as evidenced by their best accuracy of 99.78% which is better than other stateof-the-art works. This research demonstrates that the integration of deep learning and transfer learning models yields improved prediction interpretability and classification accuracy of rice leaf disease. So, we established a dependable method of deep, transfer, and ensemble learning for the diagnosis of diseases affecting rice leaves.

AB  - Transit-oriented development (TOD) has great potential to foster vibrant communities through improved access to activities around station areas. Several studies have investigated station area vibrancy and associations with TOD built environment (BE). However, few have considered the nonlinear impacts and varying relationships across station types. Taking Nanjing, China as a case study, we aim to 1) identify types of metro station areas (MSAs) with a "node-place-functionality" model and 2) unravel the nonlinear BE-vibrancy relationships and variations across MSA types. We find that five types best characterize the TOD built environment and present different levels of vibrancy indicated by the Baidu Heat Index. The GBDT (gradient boosting decision tree) models reveal transit accessibility, intersection density and commercial service density as the top three predictors of daytime and nighttime vibrancy, all presenting nonlinear and threshold effects. We also find the predicting power of BE features differs significantly across MSA types. The nuanced analyses provide context-specific planning guidance.

AB  - External stakeholders require accurate and explainable financial distress prediction (FDP) models. Complex machine learning algorithms offer high accuracy, but most of them lack explanatory power, resulting in external stakeholders being cautious in adopting them. Therefore, an explainable artificial intelligence approach including a whole process ensemble method and an explainable frame for FDP is here proposed. The ensemble algorithm from feature selection to predictor construction can achieve high accuracy according to the actual case, and the interpretation framework can meet the needs of external users by generating local explanations and global explanations. First, a two-stage scheme integrated with a filter and wrapper technique is designed for feature selection. Second, multiple ensemble models are explored and they are evaluated according to the actual case. Finally, Shapley additive explanations, counterfactual explanations and partial dependence plots are employed to enhance model interpretability. Taking financial data of Chinese listed companies from 2007 to 2020 as a dataset, the highest AUC is ensured by LightGBM with a value of 0.92. Local explanations help individual enterprises identify the key features which lead to their financial distress, and counterfactual explanations are produced to provide improvement strategies. By analyzing the features importance and the impact of feature interaction on the results, global explanations can improve the transparency and credibility of 'black box' models.

AB  - For fault detection (FD) in manufacturing, various machine learning (ML) models have been widely applied to minimize human intervention and improve detection performance. Even though ML models, such as neural networks (NNs), have been shown to identify faults effectively, root cause identification (RCI) is becoming more difficult due to their black-box structures and the tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability. In order to improve performance while maintaining interpretability, we propose a new framework named Feature Extraction for finding Root causes for Manufacturing Applications with Tree-based algorithms (FERMAT), which enhances the performance of height-limited decision trees (DTs) (C4.5) through dimensionally aware genetic programming for feature extraction. Especially in FERMAT, only interpretable features are extracted to prevent DTs from delivering uninterpretable expressions to practitioners. In the present study, FERMAT's applicability to RCI was verified with both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing datasets with different imbalance ratios. The experimental results showed that FERMAT outperformed the other single-tree-based models by extracting good features and delivered performance comparable to the black-box models.

AB  - There is a direct correlation between noise and human health, while negative consequences may vary from sleep disruption and stress to hearing loss and reduced productivity. Despite its undeniable relevance, the underlying process governing the relationship between unpleasant sound events, and the annoyance they may cause has not been systematically studied yet. In this context, this work focuses on the disturbance caused by interfloor sound events, i.e., the audio signals transmitted through the floors of a building. Activities such as walking, running, using household appliances or other daily actions generate sounds that can be heard by those on an adjacent floor. To this end, we implemented a suitable dataset including diverse interfloor sound events annotated according to the perceived disturbance. Subsequently, we propose a framework able to quantify similarities exhibited by interfloor sound events starting from standardized time-frequency representations, which are processed by a Siamese neural network composed of a series of convolutional layers. Such similarities are then employed by a $k$-medoids regression scheme making disturbance predictions based on interfloor sound events with neighboring latent representations. After thorough experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of such a framework and its superiority over popular regression algorithms. Last but not least, the proposed solution offers interpretable predictions, which may be meaningfully utilized by human experts.

AB  - Objective: To estimate the importance of risk factors on overweight/obesity among older adults by comparing different predictive model. Methods: Survey data from 400 older individuals in China was employed to assess the impacts of four domains of risk factors (demographic, health status, physical activity and neighborhood environment) on overweight/obesity. Six machine learning algorithms were utilized for prediction, and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was employed for model interpretation. Results: The CatBoost model demonstrated the highest performance among the prediction models for overweight/obesity. Gender, transportation-related physical activity and road network density were top three important features. Other significant factors included falls, cardiovascular conditions, distance to the nearest bus stop and land use mixture. Conclusion: Insufficient physical activity, denser road network and incidents of falls increased the likelihood of older adults being overweight/obese. Strategies for preventing overweight/obesity should target transportation-related physical activity, neighborhood environments, and fall prevention specifically. (c) 2024 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Shared parking has shown great potential in alleviating the shortage of parking spaces, particularly within residential areas with high parking demand. However, studies on shared parking's effectiveness in meeting nighttime parking demand remain limited. This study investigates whether shared parking facilities, integrating existing resources, can effectively alleviate nighttime parking shortages in residential areas. Using empirical data from Tianjin, China, the spatiotemporal patterns of potential shared parking demand are analyzed. The research results indicate that approximately 70 % of nighttime shortages in residential areas can be addressed through shared parking resources provided by surrounding buildings. Additionally, this study explores the nonlinear relationship between the built environment and shared parking demand, providing a quantitative analysis. Explainable machine learning techniques reveal that the built environment factors have obvious nonlinear effects and threshold effects on demand for shared parking. The important thresholds that significantly affect the demand for shared parking vary across different built environment factors. The identification of these threshold values can be beneficial for providing tailored policy to integrate existing parking facilities into shared parking, aligning with varying resource availability and residential area demands.

AB  - The in-depth understanding of the relationship between development patterns of carsharing stations and built environment are important to the comprehensive station evaluation, layout optimization and urban spatial re-sources planning. However, the previous researches mainly study the operation of carsharing by aggregate methods with cross-sectional data and rarely discovered patterns within carsharing operation time series. Therefore, an interpretable analytic framework is proposed for predicting development patterns of carsharing stations, which is composed of a development pattern construction method based on Time Series Clustering and an interpretable prediction method based on CatBoost and SHAP models. The temporal variations of time series data are sufficiently utilized by time series clustering to identify patterns and CatBoost-SHAP has better classi-fication performance and interpretability than general machine learning methods. The proposed framework is applied to explore the relationship between the development pattern of one-way carsharing stations and the built environment influencing factors. The result shows that the carsharing stations of Nanjing EVCARD are divided into two types: increasing pattern and decreasing pattern. The built environment factors that have the greatest impact on model output and the impact of pairwise factors are visually analysed. Moreover, this is also effective for a specific individual station to analyze the causes of its status quo. Therefore, this study provides data-driven intuitive decision references for carsharing operators, which helps the operators effectively manage carsharing stations.

AB  - Angio-based microvascular resistance (AMR) as a potential alternative to the index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR) and its relationship with microvascular obstruction (MVO) and other cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) parameters still lacks comprehensive validation. This study aimed to validate the correlation between AMR and CMR-derived parameters and to construct an interpretable machine learning (ML) model, incorporating AMR and clinical data, to forecast MVO in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI). We enrolled 452 STEMI patients from Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital between 2018 and 2022, who received both PPCI and CMR. After PPCI, AMR measurements and CMR-derived parameters were recorded, and clinical data were gathered. The ML workflow comprised feature selection using the Boruta algorithm, model construction with seven classifiers, hyperparameter optimization via ten-fold cross-validation, model comparison based on the area under the curve (AUC), and a Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) analysis to analyze the significance of different features. 32.29% of patients showed inconsistency between AMR and MVO, but we successfully constructed a predictive model for MVO. Among the classifiers, Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) post hyperparameter optimization displayed superior performance, achieving an AUC of 0.911 and 0.846 in the training and validation sets, respectively. SHAP analysis identified AMR as a pivotal predictor of MVO. Although we observed the inconsistency between AMR and MVO but the ML-based construction of MVO prediction model is feasible, which brings the possibility of timely prediction of patients with MVO and timely imposition of interventions during PPCI.

AB  - Every year, maritime accidents cause severe damages not only to humans but also to maritime instruments like vessels. The authors of this work therefore propose a machine learning-based maritime accident prediction system that can be used to prevent maritime accidents from happening by predicting and interpreting the accidents. This work overcomes the limitations of the existing works that lack practicability in the sense that the ex-post analyses are conducted to suggest accident prevention strategies but maritime accidents are not analyzed holistically. Using extensive literature reviews and expert interviews, a large number of risk factors associated with maritime accidents are identified, and related data are collected and utilized in the work. Throughout variable selection, data retrieval, hot-spot identification, and the maritime accident prediction model construction process, various machine learning algorithms are exploited in order to construct an organized system. In addition, interpretations for the resulting accident predictions are given using interpretable machine learning algorithms so as to provide explainable results to users. Finally, the proposed system is evaluated using a SERVQUAL model and proves its effectiveness in real-world applications.

AB  - In industrial applications, the complexity of machine learning models often makes their decision-making processes difficult to interpret and lack transparency, particularly in the steel manufacturing sector. Understanding these processes is crucial for ensuring quality control, regulatory compliance, and gaining the trust of stakeholders. To address this issue, this paper proposes LE-FIS, a large language models (LLMs)-based Explainable Fuzzy Inference System to interpret black-box models for steel defect detection. The method introduces a locally trained, globally predicted deep detection approach (LTGP), which segments the image into small parts for local training and then tests on the entire image for steel defect detection. Then, LE-FIS is designed to explain the LTGP by automatically generating rules and membership functions, with a genetic algorithm (GA) used to optimize parameters. Furthermore, state-of-the-art LLMs are employed to interpret the results of LE-FIS, and evaluation metrics are established for comparison and analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that LTGP performs well in defect detection tasks, and LE-FIS supported by LLMs provides a trustworthy and interpretable model for steel defect detection, which enhances transparency and reliability in industrial environments.

AB  - Pediatric obesity can drastically heighten the risk of cardiometabolic alterations later in life, with insulin resistance standing as the cornerstone linking adiposity to the increased cardiovascular risk. Puberty has been pointed out as a critical stage after which obesity-associated insulin resistance is more difficult to revert. Timely prediction of insulin resistance in pediatric obesity is therefore vital for mitigating the risk of its associated comorbidities. The construction of effective and robust predictive systems for a complex health outcome like insulin resistance during the early stages of life demands the adoption of longitudinal designs for more causal inferences, and the integration of factors of varying nature involved in its onset. In this work, we propose an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence-based decision support pipeline for early diagnosis of insulin resistance in a longitudinal cohort of 90 children. For that, we leverage multi-omics (genomics and epigenomics) and clinical data from the pre-pubertal stage. Different data layers combinations, pre-processing techniques (missing values, feature selection, class imbalance, etc.), algorithms, training procedures were considered following good practices for Machine Learning. SHapley Additive exPlanations were provided for specialists to understand both the decision-making mechanisms of the system and the impact of the features on each automatic decision, an essential issue in high-risk areas such as this one where system decisions may affect people's lives. The system showed a relevant predictive ability (AUC and G-mean of 0.92). A deep exploration, both at the global and the local level, revealed promising biomarkers of insulin resistance in our population, highlighting classical markers, such as Body Mass Index z-score or leptin/adiponectin ratio, and novel ones such as methylation patterns of relevant genes, such as HDAC4, , PTPRN2, , MATN2, , RASGRF1 and EBF1. . Our findings highlight the importance of integrating multi-omics data and following eXplainable Artificial Intelligence trends when building decision support systems.

AB  - Explainable artificial intelligence (AI) technology enables us to quantitatively analyze the whole prediction logic of AI as a global explanation. However, unwanted relationships learned by AI due to data sparsity, high dimensionality, and noise are also visualized in the explanation, which deteriorates confidence in the AI. Thus, methods for correcting those unwanted relationships in explanation has been developed. However, since these methods are applicable only to differentiable machine learning (ML) models but not to non-differentiable models such as tree-based models, they are insufficient for covering a wide range of ML technology. Since these methods also require re-training of the model for correcting its explanation (i.e., in-processing method), they cannot be applied to black -box models provided by third parties. Therefore, we propose a method called ensemble-based explanation correction (EBEC) as a post-processing method for correcting the global explanation of a prediction model in a model-agnostic manner by using the Rashomon effect of statistics. We evaluated the performance of EBEC with three different tasks and analyzed its function in more detail. The evaluation results indicate that EBEC can correct global explanation of the model so that the explanation aligns with the domain knowledge given by the user while maintaining its accuracy. EBEC can be extended in various ways and combined with any method to improve correction performance since it is a post-processing-type correction method. Hence, EBEC would contribute to high-productivity ML modeling as a new type of explanation-correction method.

AB  - A comprehensive understanding of the long-term data on the crop, soils, environment, climate, and production management would facilitate efficient data-driven decision-making in agriculture production under changing climate. We have employed an explainable machine learning algorithm (random forest model coupled with LIME; Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations framework) using multi-decadal (1981-2015) data on climate variables, soil properties, and yield of major crops across the Coterminous United States (CONUS). This data-driven approach explained the multi-faceted factors of crop production for corn, soybean, cotton, and wheat under field conditions by leveraging agricultural informatics. We attempted to show how crop yields can better be correlated and explained when production input varies along with changing climatic/environmental and edaphic conditions. Our findings suggest Growing Degree Days (GDDs) as important climatic factors, while water holding capacity is one of the dominant soil properties in interpreting crop yield variability. Our findings will facilitate growers, crop production scientists, land management specialists, stakeholders, and policy makers in their future decision-making processes related to sustainable and long-term soil, water, and crop management practices.

AB  - Interactive machine learning (IML) enables the incorporation of human expertise because the human participates in the construction of the learned model. Moreover, with human-in-the-loop machine learning (HITL-ML), the human experts drive the learning, and they can steer the learning objective not only for accuracy but perhaps for characterisation and discrimination rules, where separating one class from others is the primary objective. Moreover, this interaction enables humans to explore and gain insights into the dataset as well as validate the learned models. Validation requires transparency and interpretable classifiers. The huge relevance of understandable classification has been recently emphasised for many applications under the banner of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). We use parallel coordinates to deploy an IML system that enables the visualisation of decision tree classifiers but also the generation of interpretable splits beyond parallel axis splits. Moreover, we show that characterisation and discrimination rules are also well communicated using parallel coordinates. In particular, we report results from the largest usability study of a IML system, confirming the merits of our approach.

AB  - We conduct relatively extensive investigations of automatic hate speech (HS) detection using different State-of-The-Art (SoTA) baselines across 11 subtasks spanning six different datasets. Our motivation is to determine which of the recent SoTA models is best for automatic hate speech detection and what advantage methods, such as data augmentation and ensemble, may have on the best model, if any. We carry out six cross-task investigations. We achieve new SoTA results on two subtasks-macro F1 scores of 91.73% and 53.21% for subtasks A and B of the HASOC 2020 dataset, surpassing previous SoTA scores of 51.52% and 26.52%, respectively. We achieve near-SoTA results on two others-macro F1 scores of 81.66% for subtask A of the OLID 2019 and 82.54% for subtask A of the HASOC 2021, in comparison to SoTA results of 82.9% and 83.05%, respectively. We perform error analysis and use two eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) algorithms (Integrated Gradient (IG) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)) to reveal how two of the models (Bi-Directional Long Short-Term Memory Network (Bi-LSTM) and Text-to-Text-Transfer Transformer (T5)) make the predictions they do by using examples. Other contributions of this work are: (1) the introduction of a simple, novel mechanism for correcting Out-of-Class (OoC) predictions in T5, (2) a detailed description of the data augmentation methods, and (3) the revelation of the poor data annotations in the HASOC 2021 dataset by using several examples and XAI (buttressing the need for better quality control). We publicly release our model checkpoints and codes to foster transparency.

AB  - The intelligent design of shear wall structures is a critical aspect of smart construction, with a high demand for research and applications. Accurately predicting the shear wall ratio (i.e., the shear wall area-to-floor area ratio) during cost estimation and rapidly generating shear wall layouts during early design is essential. However, the unclear influences of numerous design feature parameters hinder the enhancement of generative AI design. This affects both the prediction of shear wall ratios from multidimensional features and the generation of shear wall layouts from high-dimensional features. Therefore, a method for generating key structural design features using machine learning (ML) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), along with model interpretation, is proposed in this study. Existing shear wall design data are collected, and features such as the architectural plan geometry, seismic design conditions, and shear wall ratios are extracted to establish a dataset. Key shear wall ratio parameters are predicted using an ML model with multidimensional design features as inputs, and interpretability analysis is conducted using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). Concurrently, a GAN model is built to generate shear wall designs using fused image-text high-dimensional features, and the influence patterns of design features are explained through sensitivity analysis. The analysis results indicate that the prediction accuracy is effectively enhanced by ML-based multidimensional feature learning, shear wall designs are effectively generated by GAN-based high-dimensional feature learning, and seismic design intensity and structural height are revealed as significant factors through interpretability analysis. Furthermore, when high-dimensional feature inputs are available, the generation of comprehensive features should be prioritized for shear wall structural designs.

AB  - Understanding the causes of traffic road accidents is crucial; however, as data collection is conducted by traffic police, accident-related environmental information is not available. To fill this gap, we collect information on the built environment within R = 500 m of the accident site; model the factors influencing accident severity in Shenyang, China, from 2018 to 2020 using the Random Forest algorithm; and use the SHapley Additive exPlanation method to interpret the underlying driving forces. We initially integrate five indicators of the built environment with 18 characteristics, including human and vehicle at-fault characters, infrastructure, time, climate, and land use attributes. Our results show that road type, urban/rural, season, and speed limit in the first 10 factors have a significant positive effect on accident severity; density of commercial-POI in the first 10 factors has a significant negative effect. Factors such as urban/rural and road type, commercial and vehicle type, road type, and season have significant effects on accident severity through an interactive mechanism. These findings provide important information for improving road safety.

AB  - The maintenance of an optimal inflammatory homeostasis within the body is crucial for its sustained viability within a natural environment replete with pathogenic factors. The real-time, precise detection of two antagonistic cytokines (pro- and anti-inflammatory) in an inflammatory state is fundamental to the guidance of precise clinical treatments and thus the achievement of inflammatory homeostasis. Herein, we synthesized AuAg-ZIF, which resulted in a dual enhancement of the fluorescence properties of AuNCs (35-fold increase in fluorescence intensity and 18.5-fold increase in quantum yield) by the anti-galvanic reaction between the surface Ag(I) and core Au (0), as well as by the confinement effect of ZIF-8. Furthermore, a generalized fluorescence immunoassay utilizing liposome-mediated Cu2 +-induced fluorescence quenching of AuAg-ZIF has been developed, resulting in amplification of the antigenic signal. Additionally, an interpretable machine learning prediction algorithm was constructed, comprising feature extraction, feature dimensionality reduction, model construction and validation, and model interpretation. This algorithm achieves immediate and accurate detection of factors related to anti-inflammatory, pro-inflammatory, and inflammatory levels in the human inflammatory homeostasis (R-2 > 0.95), which is in line with the accuracy of the current commercial assay kits. This integration of dual-enhanced fluorescent nanoscale materials, amplification strategies, and interpretable machine learning enables the real-time, accurate observation of inflammatory homeostasis, thereby facilitating the delivery of precision clinical treatments.

Special research emphasis is given to unraveling the complex effects using an unbiased and data-driven approach that can overcome the impacts of correlations among built environment factors. Based on empirical analysis of synthetic data and a field dataset about dockless bike sharing systems (DLBS), results demonstrate that the method of partial dependency analysis prevalent in the relevant literature, will result in biases when investigating the effects of correlated built environment factors. In comparison, accumulated local effect analysis can appropriately interpret the effects of correlated built environment factors. The main effects of many built environment factors on the usage of DLBS present nonlinear and threshold patterns, quantitively revealed by accumulated local analysis. The approach can reveal complex interaction effects between different built environment factors (e.g., commercial service and education facility, and metro station coverage and living facility) on the usage of DLBS as well. The interactions among two built environment factors could even change with the values of the factors rather than invariant. The outcomes offer a new approach for revealing complex influences of different built environment factors with correlations as well as in-depth empirical understandings regarding the usage of DLBS.

AB  - Predicting the soil swelling index (CS) is crucial for geotechnical engineer to ensure the stability of civil engineering conceptions. Recently, ML models has sparked great interest from researchers in predicting the soil swelling index. However, due to the black-box nature of ML models, their prediction capabilities are still uninterpretable. This study aims to predict the soil swelling index using ML algorithms and interpret predictions. First, it employs the prediction capability of the Gaussian process regression (GPR) algorithm and compares it to the artificial neural network (ANN) for prediction the soil swelling index. Second, the SHAP algorithm as one recent explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) models is applied to interpret the predictions of the complex GPR and ANN models. The compiled experimental database covers 362 clayey samples gathered from different sites located in Northern Algeria. The modeling involved six input features, including the liquid limit (LL), plastic limit (PL), plasticity index (PI), water content (omega n), dry density (gamma d), and void ratio (e) to predict the soil swelling index. The findings based on statistical metrics showed a good performance of GPR with R2 = 0.78 and of ANN with R2 = 0.79. Comparative study based on Wilcoxon signed- rank test and sign test indicated that the ANN outperform better than GPR. Based on the interpretations obtained by SHAP algorithm, it is observed that the liquid limit (LL) and plastic limit (PL) are the two main input features that influence the CS, indicating, the higher content of LL and PL increase the model's output.

AB  - Background and Aim: Issues in patient positioning during chest X-ray (CXR) acquisition impair diagnostic quality and potentially increase radiation dose. Automated quality assessment was proposed to address this. Our objective is to determine thresholds on some quality control metrics following international guidelines, that represent expert knowledge and can be applied in a comprehensible and explainable AI approach for such an automatic quality assessment. Materials and Methods: An AI-method estimating collimation distance to the ribcage, balancing between both clavicle heads, and number of ribs above the diaphragm as metrics for collimation, rotation, and inhalation quality was applied on 64,315 posteroanterior CXR images from a public dataset (ChestX-ray8). From this set 920 CXR images were sampled and manually annotated to gain additional trusted reference metrics. Seven readers from different institutions then classified the acquisition quality of these images independently into okay, inadequate, or unacceptable following the criteria of international guidelines. Optimal thresholds on the metrics were determined to reproduce these classes using the metrics only. Results: A fair to moderate agreement between the experts was found. When disregarding all inadequate rates a classification on the metrics was able to separate okay rated cases from unacceptable cases for collimation (AUC > 0.97), rotation (AUC = 0.93) and inhalation (AUC = 0.97). Conclusion: Suitable thresholds were determined to reproduce expert opinions in the assessment of the most important quality criteria in CXR acquisition. These thresholds were fi nally applied on the AI-method's ' s estimates to automatically classify image acquisition quality comprehensibly and according to the guidelines.

AB  - The impact of the built environment and weather conditions on travel behavior has been widely studied. However, limited studies have focused on better understanding such effects in medium-sized cities with bus -oriented transit systems, particularly from a separate perspective of travelers ' origins and destinations. We took Weinan, China, as a representative of second -tier cities in developing countries that concentrate on bus -oriented development strategies. New evidence of feature importance and nonlinear effects of crucial factors were revealed by an interpretable machine learning -based approach combining XGBoost and Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) with multi -source data. Most key factors were critical at both origins and destinations, such as the density of residential and commercial facilities. However, several important factors, such as road density and boarding time, had strong imbalanced effects on travel behavior. These findings provide novel insights and empirical implications to support urban planning strategies in medium-sized cities.

AB  - The extensive utilization of natural aggregates in the construction industry can be reduced by replacing them with natural and locally available materials like coral sand aggregate. However, accurately determining the compressive strength (CS) of coral sand aggregate concrete (CSAC) is challenging due to its complex and nonlinear behavior. Consequently, traditional techniques are ineffective. Also, there are very few reliable prediction models available in the literature for determining CS of CSAC. Thus, this study aimed to use machine learning (ML) algorithms like Multi Expression Programming (MEP), AdaBoost, and Bagging Regressor (BR) using dataset already available in the literature for predicting CS of CSAC. The dataset collected featured crucial input parameters like immersion period, confining pressure, size of coral aggregate etc. and a single output i.e., CS. The predictive models were validated by using residual assessment, k-fold cross validation, and external validation checks etc. which revealed that BR exhibited the highest accuracy having testing R2 value of 0.996. However, MEP provided an empirical equation as an output while BR failed to do so. In addition, explanatory techniques like shapely additive analysis (SHAP) and individual conditional expectation (ICE) analysis were used on the BR model to investigate the significance of input features as well as their relationship with the predicted outcome. Finally, a graphical user interface has been developed to help effectively implement the predictive models developed in this study in the industry.

AB  - This study introduces an innovative machine learning method to model the spatial variation of land surface temperature (LST) with a focus on the urban center of Da Nang, Vietnam. Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), support vector machine, random forest, and Deep Neural Network are employed to establish functional relationships between urban LST and its influencing factors. The machine learning approaches are trained and validated using remote sensing data from 2014, 2019, and 2024. Various explanatory variables representing topographical and spatial characteristics, as well as urban landscapes, are used. Experimental results show that LightGBM outperforms other benchmark methods. In addition, Shapley Additive Explanations are utilized to clarify the impact of the factors affecting LST. The analysis outcomes indicate that while the importance of these variables changes over time, urban density and greenspace density consistently emerge as the most influential factors. LightGBM attained R2 values of 0.85, 0.92, and 0.91 for the years 2014, 2019, and 2024, respectively. The findings of this work can be helpful for deeper understanding of urban heat stress dynamics and facilitate urban planning.

AB  - This study focuses on modelling sustainable concretes' mechanical and environmental properties with interpretable artificial intelligence-based automated rule extraction, management of waste materials, and meeting future prospects. In this context, 24 sustainable concrete series containing fly ash and recycled aggregates were produced. Compressive strength tests were performed on these specimens at 7, 28, and 90 days, and their mechanical properties were evaluated. Concrete classes (Class A, B, C, D) were determined using the compressive strength values obtained for each test day. The results of each concrete class were analyzed using a unique interpretable multi-objective rule extraction model, and the range values of the materials used were determined. The applied multi-objective rule extraction method is used for the first time in the literature, and its most important novelty is that, unlike other black-box artificial intelligence methods, it can also enable the creation of sustainable concrete recipes. After the range values of the materials used were found by automatic rule extraction, environmental impact assessments were performed. Among the impact categories, energy consumption and global warming potential were considered. The energy consumption results for Rule 4 were calculated as 814.8-1467.1 MJ, respectively, and a reduction of approximately 44.5% was observed. Similarly, global warming potentials for Rule 3 were obtained as 187.0-267.3 kg m3, respectively, with a reduction of about 30%. The limitations and future prospects of the study have been extensively investigated. The importance of adopting explainable/interpretable artificial intelligence-based approaches within the scope of sustainable development and circular economy goals to develop social infrastructure and buildings with low carbon emissions that are feasible in terms of mechanical and environmental properties is highlighted. Multi-Objective Optimization Based Innovative Interpretable Artificial Intelligence Method, used for the first time in mechanical and environmental modelling of sustainable concretes, can make significant contributions to the literature and future studies.

AB  - Urban renewal is essential for revitalizing existing urban land and promoting sustainable urban development, with urban renewal planning optimal being a crucial research challenge. Current planning methods neglect the complex interactions and conflicts among multiple stakeholders, and often lack explainability in the site selection process. To address these issues, proposes a Multi-Stakeholder Perspective Urban Renewal Planning Optimization (MSP-URPO) model. This innovative approach integrates a multi-objective optimization algorithm with eXplainable Machine Learning (XML) to enhance decision-making for urban renewal. The optimization algorithm resolves conflicts among multiple objectives, while XML improves the clarity and understanding of the planning results. Applied to a case study in Shenzhen, the MSP-URPO model predicts an urban renewal scale of 616 ha by 2024, selecting 786 optimal blocks from 23,957 candidates. The study reveals that residents' preferences and multi-stakeholder decision consistency significantly impact site selection, contributing 33.69 % and 27.66 % respectively. These findings demonstrate that the proposed method effectively provides a low-cost, efficient, and precise decision-support tool for urban management and renewal planning.

AB  - Residential buildings are important contributors to building energy consumption. Occupants' energy-saving behaviors and cognition have significant impacts on building energy saving, which are often influenced by factors such as group and environment, especially in shared residential spaces. Several studies have examined factors influencing energy-saving behaviors, highlighting a significant gap between these behaviors and individuals' cognition regarding energy conservation. However, why such a gap exists have not been well explored. This research aims to identify and assess factors influencing occupants' energy-saving cognition-behavior gaps in shared residential spaces, using university dormitories as a case study. By comparing five interpretable machine learning algorithms, Random Forest was found to be the optimal algorithm. The contribution of different factors to the model was explained through SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Results show that compared with individual dimension factors, interaction dimension factors such as willingness to responding to cultural measures had a more important influence on energy-saving cognition-behavior gaps. Factors exhibited the importance variability across four groups of occupants. Management strategies designed to bridge energy-saving cognition-behavior gaps for each occupant group were proposed accordingly. This research innovatively proposed a new perspective of separating energy-saving cognition and behavior to explore influencing factors of occupants' energy conservation. Furthermore, this research provided valuable insights for building managers to develop tailored energy-saving strategies aligned with occupants' cognitive and behavioural differences. By addressing these variations, managers can implement targeted interventions to enhance energy efficiency, optimize facility operations, and foster greater occupant engagement- key to advancing sustainability in the built environment.

AB  - We propose a novel approach for quantifying the sensitivity of credit portfolio value-at-risk to asset correlations with the use of synthetic financial correlation matrixesgenerated with deep learning models. In previous work, generative adversarial net-works (GANs) were employed to demonstrate the generation of plausible correlationmatrixes that capture the essential characteristics observed in empirical correlationmatrixes estimated on asset returns. Instead of GANs, we employ variational autoen-coders (VAEs) to achieve a more interpretable latent space representation and toobtain a generator of plausible correlation matrixes by sampling the VAE's latentspace. Through our analysis, we reveal that the VAE's latent space can be a use-ful tool to capture the crucial factors impacting portfolio diversification, particularlyin relation to the sensitivity of credit portfolios to changes in asset correlations. AVAE trained on the historical time series of correlation matrixes is used to generatesynthetic correlation matrixes that satisfy a set of expected financial properties. Our analysis provides clear indications that the capacity for realistic data augmentationprovided by VAEs, combined with the ability to obtain model interpretability, canprove useful for risk management, enhancing the resilience and accuracy of modelswhen backtesting, as past data may exhibit biases and might not contain the essentialhigh-stress events required for evaluating diverse risk scenarios.

AB  - Satellite evidence indicates a significant phenological changes in alpine vegetation. However, the effect of phenological changes on vegetation gross primary productivity (GPP) is still poorly understood, which limits understanding of climate changes. Here, we analyze the impact of different phenological factors on alpine grassland GPP based on sensitivity coefficient obtained from explainable machine learning. We found that alpine grassland GPP largely exhibits negative sensitivity to the duration of spring phenology and positive sensitivity to the duration of autumn phenology. Regions with negative sensitivity show an increasing trend in GPP sensitivity to both spring and autumn phenological durations, whereas areas with positive sensitivity indicate a decreasing sensitivity trend. This trend change pattern is related to the warm and humid climate of the Northern Tibetan Plateau. Results indicate a warning sign that phenological changes potentially limit the carbon benefits of alpine grassland derived from ongoing climate changes. This study comprehensively reveals the impact of phenological changes on alpine grassland. Research findings bear significant theoretical implications for the adoption of carbon neutrality strategies in alpine regions.

AB  - Cement-stabilized rammed earth (CSRE) is a sustainable construction material. The use of it allows for economizing on the cost of a structure. These two properties of CSRE are based on the fact that the soil used for the rammed mixture is usually dug close to the construction site, so it has random characteristics. That is the reason for the lack of widely accepted prescriptions for CSRE mixture, which could ascertain high enough compressive strength. Therefore, assessing which components of CSRE have the highest impact on its compressive strength becomes an important issue. There are three machine learning regression tools, i.e., artificial neural networks, decision tree, and random forest, used for predicting the compressive strength based on the relative content of CSRE composites (clay, silt, sand, gravel, cement, and water content). The database consisted of 434 samples of CSRE, which were prepared and crushed for testing purposes. Relatively low prediction errors of aforementioned models allowed for the use of explainable artificial intelligence tools (drop-out loss, mean squared error reduction, accumulated local effect) to rank the influence of the ingredients on the dependent variable-the compressive strength. Consistent results from all above-mentioned methods are discussed and compared to some statistical analysis of selected features. This innovative approach, helpful in designing the construction material is a solid base for reliable conclusions.

TI  - Development of Large-Scale Farming Based on Explainable Machine Learning for a Sustainable Rural Economy: The Case of Cyber Risk Analysis to Prevent Costly Data Breaches
T2  - APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
LA  - English
AB  - Risk management is essential to every organization's management plan. It is the strategy by which organizations handle the risks involved with their actions to profit or avoid making decisions that will cost them financially in each activity. Identifying and mitigating potential digital threats and developing and implementing procedures to significantly reduce the likelihood of an organization being targeted by cyberattacks are at the core of effective risk management. This is especially true regarding the risks associated with an organization's digital footprint. A particularly significant threat to reputation, but also at the same time indirect and direct costs, is the data breach that occurs when a security incident occurs about the data for which the organization is responsible, which results in a violation of confidentiality, availability, or the integrity of the data it manages. On the other hand, the rapid development of technology has transformed the agricultural industry, allowing for large-scale farming based on machine learning and other advanced tools. However, this transformation also exposes farms to cyber risks that can lead to costly data breaches. In this study, we propose a framework for incorporating explainable machine learning (exML) techniques into large-scale farming to enhance cyber risk analysis, mitigate cyber threats, and foster a sustainable rural economy. Specifically, given that an organization needs to implement the appropriate technical and organizational measures to avoid possible data breaches, this work presents an analytical stochastic modeling of risk with a multi-criteria objective function of low complexity, a factor in an incentive system, to model investment value and cost balancing. The motivation behind the proposed method is to improve cybersecurity, protect data and reputation, foster a sustainable rural economy, leverage explainable machine learning, and adapt to the changing technological landscape. By addressing these motivations, the method aims to provide a comprehensive and effective approach to cyber risk analysis in large-scale farming.

AB  - Previous studies have extensively explored the critical influence of the built environment on land values, but the non-linear relationship has yet to be fully revealed. This study aims to uncover the non-linear relationship between land values and the five built environment dimensions using machine learning algorithms and Shapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP). The results highlight that the Gradient Boost Decision Tree (GBDT) outperforms eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), and Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR) in land value estimation, exhibiting higher R2 and lower Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The results illustrate that density and destination accessibility are the dominant factors, contributing 32.48% and 37.38% to land value variation, respectively. We observed that the top three factors affecting land values are the built-floor area ratio, the number of floors and the number of restaurants. Additionally, the results revealed the non-linear relationship between the built environment and land values, suggesting that maintaining built environment features at optimal thresholds may increase land values. Neglecting interaction effects may lead to bias in determining relationships between land values and the built environment. This study contributes to the literature by providing non-linear and threshold identification evidence in land value determinants, offering valuable insights for urban planners and real estate managers.

AB  - The complex interdependencies among High-Velocity Oxygen Fuel (HVOF) thermal spraying parameters critically govern coating microstructure evolution yet remain insufficiently quantified. This study establishes an interpretable machine learning framework connecting process parameters to particle behavior and coating architecture in CoCrFeNiMo0.2 high-entropy alloy (HEA) coatings. A validated multiphase Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model first captures in-flight particle dynamics (temperature/velocity/trajectory) under varying HVOF conditions, including oxygen-fuel ratio, kerosene/oxygen flow rates, particle size/shape/injection velocity, and spraying distance. Systematic dataset generation facilitates comparative evaluation of 11 machine learning (ML) algorithms, with XGBoost demonstrating superior predictive accuracy (R2 approximate to 0.99) for particle characteristics. Subsequently, interpretability analysis using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) revealed three critical findings: (i) the sensitivity hierarchy of HVOF spray parameters on particle characteristics, with particle size and spraying distance exerting dominant control over particle thermal-kinetic states, (ii) inherent interdependencies among process parameters governing particle flight behavior, and (iii) optimal spraying parameter ranges for coating quality control. Implementation of ML-optimized parameters in HVOF thermal spraying experiments yielded a CoCrFeNiMo0.2 HEA coating with 0.21 % porosity. This investigation systematically addresses the inherent complexity and nonlinearity of thermal spray processes, providing a methodological framework that transcends conventional empirical approaches.

AB  - There are numerous studies examining the impact of morphological characteristics on the energy performance of buildings. However, there are a limited number of studies that investigate energy consumption in relation to urban forms across metropolitan areas using big data and AI techniques. This study aims to evaluate the energy performance of different urban forms based on their morphological characteristics in Istanbul, employing AI driven methods. In the study, the energy performance certificates of 36,901 buildings, selected through a data preprocessing process, were used to accurately represent different residential typologies. Among eight different machine learning techniques that tested both linear and nonlinear relationships among variables, the most successful results were obtained from techniques based on decision trees that capture nonlinear relationships. Among these techniques, the Random Forest model demonstrated the highest predictive performance, achieving an R-squared score of 77%. The influence of variables was further analyzed using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), revealing that total construction area and building compactness were the most influential variables in model predictions. This approach also enabled the identification of critical threshold values of these variables affecting energy consumption. Additionally, geometric variables were employed as predictor variables in AI models to estimate energy consumption for 713,648 buildings lacking available data. In another phase of the study, clustering analysis was performed to classify 51,862 building blocks into seven distinct urban form types. The estimated energy consumption data of buildings were integrated with the classified building block data to systematically examine the energy performance of different urban forms. As a result, among the seven different urban forms, 'open skyscraper' was identified as the most efficient in terms of energy performance, while 'irregular compact low-rise' was determined to be the least efficient. The study contributes to supporting research in energy-efficient urban planning through the application of AI techniques in both analysis and modelling.

AB  - In response to the critical issue of milk adulteration jeopardizing both the nutritional integrity of milk and the health of consumers, this paper presents an innovative Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled Internet of Things (IoT) based multi-sensor system. The escalating consumption of milk as a pivotal nutritional source necessitates robust measures to ensure its safety and quality. Traditional methods of detecting adulteration have shown limitations, prompting the development of an automated and advanced approach. The proposed system integrates various sensors capable of real-time measurement, including pH, electrical conductivity (EC), temperature, gas parameters, and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) parameters. This comprehensive approach extends to measuring key constituents of milk samples like Fat, Protein, Solids Not Fat (SNF), Lactose, and Gravity values. To address specific adulterants-Urea, Starch, Sodium Bicarbonate, Maltodextrin, and Formaldehyde-a machine learningbased ensemble technique is employed for classification. This ensemble method outperforms conventional algorithms like RF, Light GBM, and Extra Trees Classifiers, achieving an impressive 96% accuracy rate in detecting adulterants within the milk dataset. The pivotal contribution of this study lies in the development of an IoT-based data acquisition device that seamlessly integrates with the sensor system, enabling efficient and precise measurements. Additionally, XAI is used to analyse the results obtained by the proposed model. For this, a framework called SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis is employed to elucidate the decision-making process of the ensemble model, enhancing the interpretability of results. By virtue of its real-time monitoring capabilities and accurate classification, the AI-enabled IoT-based multi-sensor system emerges as a promising solution for addressing milk adulteration. This innovation holds the potential to bolster milk quality control measures in the dairy industry. The system's ability to swiftly detect and categorize adulterants underscores its significance in combating the pervasive issue of compromised milk quality, thereby ensuring consumer safety and fostering industry integrity.

AB  - Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites, possessing some unique properties, like high specific strength, stiffness, corrosion and temperature resistance etc. have now become attractive choices in many of the aviation, automobile, marine, military, medical, construction and sports industries. But, their anisotropic and non-homogeneous structure, and low thermal conductivity make them quite difficult to machine, occasionally leading to excessive tool wear and poor surface quality. In this paper, treating spindle speed (N), feed rate (f) and depth of cut (ap) as the input parameters, 27 milling experiments are conducted on CFRP composite laminates based on Taguchi's L27 orthogonal array, and their effects on material removal rate (MRR), and two surface roughness parameters, i.e. Ra and Rz are investigated. Results of the parametric analysis are later validated using an explainable artificial intelligence technique, in the form of Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), accompanied by ascertaining the most significant input parameters affecting each of the responses of the milling process. The said process is finally optimized using a multi-criteria decision making tool, i.e. technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), identifying an ideal combination of the milling parameters as N = 7500 rpm, f = 0.3 mm/sec and ap = 1.5 mm, resulting in simultaneous maximization of MRR and minimization of the two surface roughness parameters. This paper thus provides a new framework for parametric analysis and multi-objective optimization of milling of CFRP composite laminates resulting in higher productivity along with better surface quality.

The objective of this study was to assist radiologists in mammography phantom image evaluation by developing and validating an interpretable deep learning model capable of objectively evaluating the quality of standard phantom images for mammography.Materials and Methods: A total of 2,208 mammography phantom images were collected for periodic accreditation of the scanner from 1,755 institutions. The dataset was randomly split into training (1,808 images) and testing (400 images) datasets with subgroups (76 images) for the multi-reader study. To develop an interpretable model that contains two deep learning networks in series, five processing steps were performed: mammography phantom detection, phantom object detection, post-processing, score evaluation, and a report with a comment about ambiguous results. Results: For phantom detection, the accuracy and mean intersection over union (mIOU) were 1.00 and 0.938 in the test dataset, respectively. During phantom object detection, a total of 6,369 out of 6,400 objects were detected as the correct object class, and the accuracy and mIOU were 0.995 and 0.813, respectively. The predicted score for each object showed a consensus of 97.40% excluding ambiguous points and 59.10% for ambiguous points of the groups.Conclusions: The interpretable deep learning model using large-scale data from multiple centers shows high performance and reasonable object scoring, successfully validating the reliability and feasibility of mammography phantom image quality management.

AB  - In a 16-years long-term fertilizer experiment, an in-depth study was carried out to evaluate the changes in soil physical, chemical, and biological properties under long-term fertilizer application and establish cause and effect relationship between soil properties and rice productivity using interpretable machine learning. There were 12 treatments involving control (without fertilizer application), 100% N (recommended dose of nitrogen), 100% NP (recommended dose of nitrogen and phosphorus), 100% PK (recommended dose of phosphorus and potassium), 100% NPK (recommended dose of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium), 150% NPK (50% higher nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium than recommended), 100% NPK + Zn (recommended nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium along with Zinc), 100% NPK + FYM (recommended nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium along with farmyard manure (FYM)), 100% NPK + FYM + LIME (recommended nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium along with FYM and lime), 100% NPK + Zn + S (recommended nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium along with zinc and sulphur), 100% NPK + Zn + B (recommended nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium along with Zinc and Boron) and 100% NPK + Lime (recommended nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium along with lime). At first, a conditional random forest model was built, based on which important variables were selected using the permutation-based variable importance approach. Further, the accumulated local effect plot was used to establish a cause and effect relationship between important soil properties and rice yield. Although most of the soil properties varied across the treatments, total potassium, protease, urease, and permanganate oxidisable carbon are the most important soil properties, individually accounting for up to 400 kg ha-1 variation in the rice productivity. The study demonstrated how interpretable machine learning techniques could be used in long-term fertilizer experiments to unravel the most meaningful information, and these techniques can be used in other similar long-term experiments.

AB  - Drug response prediction is important to establish personalized medicine for cancer therapy. Model construction for predicting drug response (i.e., cell viability half-maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50]) of an individual drug by inputting pharmacogenomics in disease models remains critical. Machine learning (ML) has been predominantly applied for prediction, despite the advent of deep learning (DL). Moreover, whether DL or traditional ML models are superior for predicting cell viability IC50s has to be established. Herein, we constructed ML and DL drug response prediction models for 24 individual drugs and compared the performance of the models by employing gene expression and mutation profiles of cancer cell lines as input. We observed no significant difference in drug response prediction performance between DL and ML models for 24 drugs [root mean squared error (RMSE) ranging from 0.284 to 3.563 for DL and from 0.274 to 2.697 for ML; R-2 ranging from -7.405 to 0.331 for DL and from -8.113 to 0.470 for ML]. Among the 24 individual drugs, the ridge model of panobinostat exhibited the best performance (R-2 0.470 and RMSE 0.623). Thus, we selected the ridge model of panobinostat for further application of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Using XAI, we further identified important genomic features for panobinostat response prediction in the ridge model, suggesting the genomic features of 22 genes. Based on our findings, results for an individual drug employing both DL and ML models were comparable. Our study confirms the applicability of drug response prediction models for individual drugs.

AB  - The surface defect has a direct impact on the performance and quality of the final product, so it is crucial to identify the key factors causing the defect. To achieve accurate key factor identification, an eXplainable AI-based Pipeline (XAIP) is proposed herein. The proposed XAIP combines data mode clustering and local model construction to meet practical application requirements. Meanwhile, after analyzing the characteristics of practical data, a strategy for defect rate calculation is designed to provide more fine-grained defect-related information to supervise model training. The final identification results are presented by a two-stage explainable method, which is designed to reveal the information of data modes and key variables and can give engineers more specific defect-related information. The experiment results based on two practical manufacturing datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - Extrusion-based bioprinting (EBB) is an efficient, simple, and cost-effective bioprinting technique. However, due to the high complexity of biomaterial inks, a trial-and-error approach is typically required for determining the optimal printing parameter configurations. Thus, the quality and reproducibility of printed scaffolds remain a concern. In this study, we integrated flow sensing into the EBB and replaced conventional fixed-value printing parameters by capturing the timeseries data of all printing parameters to enhance the monitoring of the printing process. To improve the EBB adaptability, we conducted experiments with three biomaterial inks with distinct properties under various parameter configurations to achieve ink-insensitive linewidth prediction through the construction and assessment of deep learning models. Additionally, two explainable artificial intelligence methods were used to analyze the decision-making process of the deep learning model. This analysis not only enhanced model reliability but also identified key features in printing parameters and time-series data. These results can be used to improve the efficiency and quality of the EBB processes by using various biomaterial inks.

AB  - The challenge of the research work presented in the paper is to combine the growing interest in monitoring the health condition of existing bridge heritage through systematic and periodic visual inspections with automated recognition of typical bridge defects, which can greatly facilitate the assessment of defect evolution over time. The study focused on the automated identification of defects in existing Reinforced Concrete (RC) bridges exploiting different Deep Learning (DL) approaches and techniques to interpret the obtained predictions. Ensuring the safety of infrastructures is typically a technical and economic issue. Still, in the case of the engineering infrastructure heritage, there are existing bridges and viaducts with a high historical, cultural, and symbolic value. For them, accurate knowledge and characterization of possible degradation processes become particularly important in order to define intervention strategies that combine safety and conservation requirements. With the aim to develop sys-tematic and non-invasive investigation protocols for continuous and effective control of defects and their evolution, a database of existing RC bridge defect images was collected, and the most recurrent defect typologies were classified by domain experts. Some existing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) algorithms were applied to the dataset for automatically recognizing all defects, but the specific novel contribution of the research work is the interpretation of the obtained results in a form that is humanly explainable and directly implementable in new tools for bridge inspections. To interpret the results, Class Activation Maps (CAMs) approaches were employed within available eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, which allow to observe the activation zones and nearly perfectly highlight the type of specific defect in a given image. The obtained results, besides suggesting which network works better than others and if the specific defect is effectively recognized, have been evaluated through a quasi-quantitative procedure that compared a qualitative assessment of the CNNs models reliability with two novel indexes representing new explaining metrics of the obtained results. In the end, the outcomes of the proposed study were observed also in a real-life case study. The proposed discussion opens new scenarios in the application of these techniques for supporting road management companies and public organizations in the evaluation of the road networks health state.

AB  - Clarifying the mechanisms by which the micro-scale built environment influences urban vitality is an important scientific challenge, to guide precise urban planning in the context of urban renewal. In this study, we quantify the intensity of human activities through Baidu heat maps, analyze social interaction patterns using social media check-in data, and integrate built environment elements such as road network topology, 3D building morphology, and the spatial distribution of points of interest (POIs). A machine learning technique combining a real-encoded Accelerated Genetic Algorithm-Projective Pathfinding Model (RAGA-PPM) and Shapley Additive Projection for Interpretability (SHAP) for Interpretability Analysis (IPA) was used to investigate the nonlinear mechanisms of 17 factors affecting urban vitality in Macau Peninsula, China. Firstly, the explanatory power of the built environment for comprehensive vitality was significantly better than the other dimensions. Two factors, population vitality and microblogging check-in vitality, contributed the most to the composite vitality value. Secondly, road network density was the most important built environment factor affecting urban vitality in Macau Peninsula (SHAP = 0.025). Finally, the impacts of built environment factors on urban vitality showed nonlinearities, and the threshold effects of the core factors (road network density, spatial fractal dimension, and openness to the sky) showed a consistent neighborhood-level pattern. This study establishes a framework for micro-vitality mechanisms in high-density cities, addressing the limitations of traditional methods in modeling complex nonlinear relationships. The methodological integration of RAGA-PPM and SHAP advances the innovative paradigm of applying interpretable machine learning to the study of urban form.

AB  - The layout design of analog integrated circuits has been defying all automation attempts, and it is still primarily a handcrafting process carried by circuit designers on traditional layout editing frameworks. This paper presents a toolbox based on deep learning techniques and a sturdy graphical user interface to assist designers during that process. The underlying mechanism of this toolbox relies on a simple pairwise device interaction circuit description, i.e., the circuits' topological constraints, to propose valid floorplan solutions for block-level structures, including topologies and deep nanometer technology nodes not used for its training, at push-button speed. Despite its automatic functionalities, the toolbox is focused on explainable artificial intelligence, involving the designer in the synthesis flow via filtering and editing options over the candidate floorplan solutions. This constant state of human-machine feedback environment turns the designer aware of the impact of each device's position change and inherent tradeoffs while suggesting subsequent moves, ultimately increasing the designers' productivity in this time-consuming and iterative task. Finally, the toolbox is shown to instantly generate floorplans with similar or better constraint fulfilment than human designed solutions for state-of-the-art analog circuit blocks.

AB  - BackgroundThe occurrence of outdoor activity limitation (OAL) among older adults is influenced by multidimensional and confounding factors associated with aging.AimThe aim of this study was to apply interpretable machine learning (ML) to develop models for multidimensional aging constraints on OAL and identify the most predictive constraints and dimensions across multidimensional aging data.MethodsThis study involved 6794 community-dwelling participants older than 65 from the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS). Predictors included related to six dimensions: sociodemographics, health condition, physical capacity, neurological manifestation, daily living habits and abilities, and environmental conditions. Multidimensional interpretable machine learning models were assembled for model construction and analysis.ResultsThe multidimensional model demonstrated the best predictive performance (AUC: 0.918) compared to the six sub-dimensional models. Among the six dimensions, physical capacity had the most remarkable prediction (AUC: physical capacity: 0.895, daily habits and abilities: 0.828, physical health: 0.826, neurological performance: 0.789, sociodemographic: 0.773, and environment condition: 0.623). The top-ranked predictors were SPPB score, lifting ability, leg strength, free kneeling, laundry mode, self-rated health, age, attitude toward outdoor recreation, standing time on one foot with eyes open, and fear of falling.DiscussionReversible and variable factors, which are higher in the set of high-contribution constraints, should be prioritized as the main contributing group in terms of interventions.ConclusionThe integration of potentially reversible factors, such as neurological performance in addition to physical function into ML models, yields a more accurate assessment of OAL risk, which provides insights for targeted, sequential interventions for older adults with OAL.

AB  - A large-scale review and analysis of the existing methods and approaches to extract rules from artificial neural networks, including deep learning neural networks, is carried out. A wide range of methods and approaches to extract rules and related approaches to develop explainable artificial intelligence (AI) systems are considered. The taxonomy and several directions in studies of explainable neural networks related to the extraction of rules from neural networks, which allow the user to get an idea of how the neural network uses the input data, and also, using rules, to reveal the hidden relationships of the input data and the results found, are explored. This review focuses on the relationship of the most common rule-based explanation systems in AI with the most powerful machine learning algorithms using neural networks. In addition to rule extraction, other methods of constructing explainable AI systems are considered based on the construction of special modules that interpret each step of changing the neural network's weights. A comprehensive analysis of the existing research makes it possible to draw conclusions about the appropriateness of using certain approaches. The results of the analysis will allow us to get a detailed picture of the state of research in this area and create our own applications based on neural networks, the results of which can be studied in detail and their reliability evaluated. The development of such systems is necessary for the development of the digital economy in Russia and the creation of applications that allow making responsible and explainable management decisions in critical areas of the national economy.

AB  - Hypothyroidism is a known adverse event associated with the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in cancer treatment. This study aimed to develop an interpretable machine learning (ML) model for individualized prediction of hypothyroidism in patients treated with ICIs. The retrospective cohort of patients treated with ICIs was from the First Affiliated Hospital of Ningbo University. ML methods applied include logistic regression (LR), random forest classifier (RFC), support vector machine (SVM), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) was the main evaluation metric used. Furthermore, the Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) was utilized to interpret the outcomes of the prediction model. A total of 458 patients were included in the study, with 59 patients (12.88%) observed to have developed hypothyroidism. Among the models utilized, XGBoost exhibited the highest predictive capability (AUC = 0.833). The Delong test and calibration curve indicated that XGBoost significantly outperformed the other models in prediction. The SHAP method revealed that thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was the most influential predictor variable. The developed interpretable ML model holds potential for predicting the likelihood of hypothyroidism following ICI treatment in patients. ML technology offers new possibilities for predicting ICI-induced hypothyroidism, potentially providing more precise support for personalized treatment and risk management.

AB  - Prediction of local mean age of air (MAA) is a key technology that can enhance the comfort, health, and productivity of indoor residents by adjusting and optimizing the indoor environmental conditions. In this study, we developed a deep neural network (DNN)-based regression model to predict indoor air quality (IAQ) and proposed a permutation feature importance (PFI)-based explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) model to implement efficient ventilation systems in a hospital ward utilizing this regression model. The rapid prediction of the MAA in the space near each patient in the ward, depending on the location of the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) inlets and fluid velocity, were successfully measured through data-driven deep learning model training. Consequently, the proposed MAA prediction model achieved average R-squared values of 0.9506 and 0.9220 for MAA(1) and MAA(2), respectively. In addition, the DNN model demonstrated rapid predictive performance (similar to 0.4 ms/prediction), highlighting the possibility of real-time monitoring compared to conventional methods. Furthermore, the contribution of the location and fluid velocity of the HVAC system to the MAA in the space near the patient was analyzed using PFI. These results support the rapid virtual sensing and recommendation method that has the potential to be applied in future IAQ management, human healthcare, and energy management systems.

AB  - Improving the energy efficiency and thermal comfort of existing residential buildings is essential for sustainable urban development. However, uncertainties in occupant behaviors and building constructions pose challenges to optimizing retrofit strategies. This study presents an integrated approach combining physics-based energy simulation, interpretable machine learning, and multi-objective optimization to quantify these uncertainties and identify optimal retrofit strategies. Latin Hypercube Sampling was used to generate representative variability in occupant and construction parameters, while Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) served as a surrogate model to reduce the computational burden of detailed simulations. Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and standardized regression coefficients were applied to enhance model interpretability and identify key features influencing energy and comfort performance. The approach was applied to representative Canadian singledetached houses across four climate zones and three HVAC systems: natural gas furnaces, air source heat pumps, and ground source heat pumps. XGBoost achieved R2 values above 0.85 for energy consumption and 0.95 for discomfort hours in most scenarios. Heating setpoint temperature, airtightness, and equipment power density emerged as dominant factors, with their relative importance varying by HVAC types and climate conditions. Passive retrofits were more impactful in colder zones, while behavioral adjustments were more effective in milder climates. The surrogate-based model reduced computation time by 89.7%. Pareto optimal solutions demonstrated up to 48% energy savings and 32% discomfort hour reductions. The proposed method offers actionable insights for policymakers and practitioners to implement targeted, efficient, and adaptive retrofit strategies under uncertainty.

AB  - Ensemble algorithms can learn complex nonlinear relationships in large datasets resulting in higher predictive accuracies than the conventional methods. Practitioners and regulators have shown substantial hesitance in adopting them in credit risk management because of their need for explainablity. Using five ensemble learning techniques and a one-dimensional convolutional neural network, we assess indicators to predict asset quality deterioration in a consumer loan dataset using the SHAP framework to achieve explainablity of the models' ranking of features significance. We implemented a novel model-agnostic aggregate ranking method to rank the importance of the overall features from each model in predicting NPLs.

AB  - Objective: This study aims to construct a predictive model based on machine learning algorithms to assess the risk of prolonged hospital stays post-surgery for colorectal cancer patients and to analyze preoperative and postoperative factors associated with extended hospitalization.
   Methods: We prospectively collected clinical data from 83 colorectal cancer patients. The study included 40 variables (comprising 39 predictor variables and 1 target variable). Important variables were identified through variable selection via the Lasso regression algorithm, and predictive models were constructed using ten machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Light Gradient Boosting Machine, KNN, and Extreme Gradient Boosting, Categorical Boosting, Artificial Neural Network and Deep Forest. The model performance was evaluated using Bootstrap ROC curves and calibration curves, with the optimal model selected and further interpreted using the SHAP explainability algorithm.
   Results: Ten significantly correlated important variables were identified through Lasso regression, validated by 1000 Bootstrap resamplings, and represented through Bootstrap ROC curves. The Logistic Regression model achieved the highest AUC (AUC=0.99, 95% CI=0.97-0.99). The explainable machine learning algorithm revealed that the distance walked on the third day post-surgery was the most important variable for the LR model.
   Conclusion: This study successfully constructed a model predicting postoperative hospital stay duration using patients' clinical data. This model promises to provide healthcare professionals with a more precise prediction tool in clinical practice, offering a basis for personalized nursing interventions, thereby improving patient prognosis and quality of life and enhancing the efficiency of medical resource utilization.

AB  - In the area of machine learning (ML) training data optimization through the construction of compact data, the focus of this paper is presented. The concept of compact data design, aimed at creating an optimized dataset that maximizes benefits without the need to manage a vast amount of complex data, is introduced. Improvements in the methods for optimizing ML training have been incorporated into the development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. The introduction of understanding ML training datasets as a facet of Explainable AI (XAI), comprehensible to humans, has been made. Among the methods of XAI, the evaluation of input feature importance stands out as a way to enhance the accuracy of complex ML models. The innovative method of compact data design for optimizing ML training through dataset reduction is proposed. The performance of an ML-based malware detection system, along with its variant utilizing compact data, has been assessed, demonstrating the maintenance of 99% accuracy. By applying a 76% reduced input dataset, the speed of ML training with the novel compact data design could be maximized, suggesting that an ML system trained in this manner could achieve statistically equivalent accuracy with only 57% of the original data sample size.

AB  - Inspired by the attractive features of least-squares theory in many practical applications, this contribution introduces least-squares-based deep learning (LSBDL). Least-squares theory connects explanatory variables to predicted variables, called observations, through a linear(ized) model in which the unknown parameters of this relation are estimated using the principle of least-squares. Conversely, deep learning (DL) methods establish nonlinear relationships for applications where predicted variables are unknown (nonlinear) functions of explanatory variables. This contribution presents the DL formulation based on least-squares theory in linear models. As a data-driven method, a network is trained to construct an appropriate design matrix of which its entries are estimated using two descent optimization methods: steepest descent and Gauss-Newton. In conjunction with interpretable and explainable artificial intelligence, LSBDL leverages the well-established least-squares theory for DL applications through the following three-fold objectives: (i) Quality control measures such as covariance matrix of predicted outcome can directly be determined. (ii) Available least- squares reliability theory and hypothesis testing can be established to identify mis-specification and outlying observations. (iii) Observations' covariance matrix can be exploited to train a network with inconsistent, heterogeneous and statistically correlated data. Three examples are presented to demonstrate the theory. The first example uses LSBDL to train coordinate basis functions for a surface fitting problem. The second example applies LSBDL to time series forecasting. The third example showcases a real-world application of LSBDL to downscale groundwater storage anomaly data. LSBDL offers opportunities in many fields of geoscience, aviation, time series analysis, data assimilation and data fusion of multiple sensors.

AB  - The composite comprising waste concrete and industrial by-products for producing recycled aggregate self-compacting concrete (RA-SCC) mitigates natural resource depletion and reduces greenhouse gas emissions, thus offering significant environmental benefits. This study aims to predict the compressive strength of RA-SCC by using five interpretable machine learning (ML) methods including M5P model tree, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). To develop the ML models, a dataset containing 454 samples was constructed, encompassing experimental data with varying material dosages, curing ages, and recycled aggregate properties. The hyperparameters were optimized using Bayesian optimization and 10-fold cross-validation. Additionally, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was employed to assess the importance and contributions of the input parameters affecting compressive strength. The results indicated that the XGBoost model achieved the highest accuracy among the tested models, with R2 = 0.909, RMSE = 4.99 MPa, and MAE = 3.54 MPa. SHAP analysis revealed that cement content and age were the most influential factors positively affecting compressive strength predictions, while fly ash and recycled concrete aggregate content exhibited the highest negative effects. The ML models proposed in this study provide a systematic evaluation of the compressive strength predictions for RA-SCC and offer valuable insights for concrete mix design and quality control.

AB  - Objectives: Despite substantial advancements in both treatment and prevention, colorectal cancer continues to be a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality. This study investigated the potential of using demographics and prescribed drug information to predict risk of colorectal cancer using a machine learning approach. Methods: Five different machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Random Forests, kNN, and Voting Classifier, were initially developed and evaluated for their predictive capabilities across various time horizons (3, 6, 12, and 36 months). To enhance transparency and interpretability, explainable techniques were employed to understand the model's predictions and identify the relative contributions of factors like age, sex, social status, and prescribed medications, promoting trust and clinical insights. While all developed models, including simpler ones such as Logistic Regression, demonstrated comparable performance, the Voting Classifier, as an ensemble model, was selected for further investigation due to its inherent diversity and generalizability. This ensemble model combines predictions from multiple base models, reducing the risk of overfitting and improving the robustness of the final prediction. Results: The model demonstrated consistent performance across these time horizons, achieving a precision consistently above 0.99, indicating high ability in identifying patients at risk. However, the recall remained relatively low (around 0.6), highlighting the model's limitations in comprehensively identifying all at risk patients, despite its high precision. This suggests additional investigations in future studies to further enhance the performance of the proposed model. Conclusion: Machine learning models can identify individuals at higher risk for developing colorectal cancer, enabling earlier interventions and personalized risk management strategies. However, further studies are needed before implementation in clinical practice.

AB  - Along with the development of remote sensing technology, the spatial-temporal variability of vegetation productivity has been well observed. However, the drivers controlling the variation in vegetation under various climate gradients remain poorly understood. Identifying and quantifying the independent effects of driving factors on a natural process is challenging. In this study, we adopted a potent machine learning (ML) model and an ML interpretation technique with high fidelity to disentangle the effects of climatic variables on the long-term averaged net primary productivity (NPP) across the Amazon rainforests. Specifically, the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model was employed to model the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NPP data, and the Shapley addictive explanation (SHAP) method was introduced to account for nonlinear relationships between variables identified by the model. Results showed that the dominant driver of NPP across the Amazon forests varied in different regions, with temperature dominating the most considerable portion of the ecoregion with a high importance score. In addition, light augmentation, increased CO2 concentration, and decreased precipitation positively contributed to Amazonia NPP. The wind speed for most vegetated areas was under the optimum, which benefits NPP, while sustained high wind speed would bring substantial NPP loss. We also found a non-monotonic response of Amazonia NPP to VPD and attributed this relationship to the moisture load in Amazon forests. Our application of the explainable machine learning framework to identify the underlying physical mechanism behind NPP could be a reference for identifying relationships between components in natural processes.

AB  - In-situ monitoring is crucial for enhancing process quality control in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). Currently, data-driven approaches in LPBF in-situ quality monitoring have shown remarkable success. However, existing data-driven methods often lack integration with physical knowledge, leading to the opacity of decision-making processes. Research on LPBF knowledgedata mixed-driven modeling is still relatively scarce. To address this gap, this paper proposes a deep graph network method guided by prior knowledge (MK-DGNet) for in-situ quality inspection based on coaxial melt pool images. In the proposed method, prior knowledge is first extracted based on understanding of melt pool. Then, the fusion module is used to place images and knowledge vectors in the same dimensional space. Finally, a deep graph network architecture is elaborately established, taking graph-formatted data as input to learn deep-layer relationships between nodes and edges. The superiority of MK-DGNet is demonstrated using publicly available NIST datasets and self-built CMPQ dataset. Additionally, explainable artificial intelligence methods are employed to explain the basis of network decisions and the effectiveness of prior knowledge. This research provides new methods and perspectives for addressing quality issues in the LPBF process.

AB  - The construction of community elderly care facilities (CECF) is pivotal for promoting healthy aging and "aging in place" for older people. This study focuses on the low utilization rates of community elderly care facilities in the Dongcheng and Xicheng Districts, core areas of Beijing. The explainable machine learning method is used to analyze data across three dimensions: the elderly's individual attributes, characteristics of the community elderly care station (CECS), and features of the built environment around CECS and subdistrict, to identify the important factors that influence the usage frequency of overall CECS and its different functional spaces, and also the correlation between factors and usage frequency of CECS. It shows that the most important factors are the features of CSCF, including the degree of space acceptance and satisfaction with services provided, which influence the usage frequency of nine functional spaces (R2 >= 0.68) and overall (R2 = 0.56). In addition, older people's individual factors, such as age and physical condition, significantly influence the usage of specific spaces such as rehabilitation therapy rooms and assistive bathing rooms. The influence of built environment characteristics is relatively low, with factors such as the density of bus stations and housing prices within the subdistrict and the mean distance from CECF to the nearest subway stations being more important. These findings provide a reference for the construction of indoor environments, management of service quality, and optimal site selection for future community elderly care facilities.

AB  - As a key technology of intelligent transportation system, the intelligent vehicle is the carrier of comprehensive integration of many technologies. Although vision-based autonomous driving has shown excellent prospects, there is still a problem of how to analyze the complicated traffic situation by the collected data. Recently, autonomous driving has been formulated as many tasks separately by using different models, such as object detection task and intention recognition task. In this study, a vision-based system was developed to detect and identity various objects and predict the intention of pedestrians in the traffic scene. The main contributions of this research are (1) an optimized model was presented to detect 10 kinds of objects based on the structure of YOLOv4; (2) a fine-tuned Part Affinity Fields approach was proposed to estimate the pose of pedestrians; (3) Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) technology is added to explain and assist the estimation results in the risk assessment phase; (4) an elaborate self-driving dataset that includes several different subsets for each corresponding task was introduced; and (5) an end-to-end system containing multiple models with high accuracy was developed. Experimental results proved that the total parameters of optimized YOLOv4 are reduced by 74% which satisfies the real-time capability. In addition, the detection precision of the optimized YOLOv4 achieved an improvement of 2.6%; compared to the state-of-the-art.

AB  - Deep learning is a modeling method based on neural network, which is constructed of multiple different functional perception layers and optimized by learning the inherent regularity of a large amount of data to achieve end-to-end modeling. The growth of data and the improvement of computing power promoted the applications of deep learning in spectral and medical image analysis. The lack of interpretability of the constructed models, however, constitutes an obstacle to their further development and applications. To overcome this obstacle of deep learning, various interpretability methods are proposed. According to different principles of explanation, interpretability methods are divided into three categories: visualization methods, model distillation, and interpretable models. Visualization methods and model distillation belong to external algorithms, which interpret a model without changing its structure, while interpretable models aim to make the model structure interpretable. In this review, the principles of deep learning and three interpretability methods are introduced from the perspective of algorithms. Moreover, the applications of the interpretability methods in spectral and medical image analysis in the past three years are summarized. In most studies, external algorithms were developed to make the models explainable, and these methods were found to be able to provide reasonable explanation for the abilities of the deep learning models. However, few studies attempt to construct interpretable algorithms within networks. Furthermore, most studies try to train the model through collecting large amounts of labeled data, which leads to huge costs in both labor and expenses. Therefore, training strategies with small data sets, approaches to enhance the interpretability of models, and the construction of interpretable deep learning architectures are still required in future work

KW  - STRENGTH
KW  - RESISTANCE
AB  - Predicting concrete's compressive strength (CS) is a crucial and challenging task in civil engineering as it directly impacts the longevity and structural integrity of infrastructure initiatives. Precise estimation of the water-cement ratio (W/C) is essential for guaranteeing the structural integrity of structures since it is a critical parameter that greatly affects concrete's CS. This study carries out an extensive investigation of the prediction of the W/C of concrete, utilizing the enormous potential of machine learning, including the backpropagation neural network (BPNN), bilayer neural network, boosted tree algorithm, bagged tree algorithm (BGTA), and support vector regression (SVR), using 108 datasets. We integrate artificial intelligence models with traditional engineering techniques to develop a reliable, precise, and efficient forecasting system. The study input includes curing days (D), fiber (F), cement (C), fine and coarse aggregate (FA and CA), density (Den), CS, water (W), and W/C as the output variables. The result shows that, in comparison to the other models, BGTA-M3 achieved the best performance evaluation criterion. In the calibration and verification phases, NSE, PCC, R, and WI = 1 and MAPE = 0.00, respectively. BPNN-M3 had an MAPE of 0.0004 in the verification phase. The study uses SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), an explainable artificial intelligence (AI) technique, to improve decision-making in complex systems, with cement "C" significantly contributing to higher predictions in SVR-M2. Future studies should expand the dataset to include information from diverse geographic areas, environmental conditions, and concrete mixes to enhance the applicability and dependability of the models.

AB  - In this study, we developed an interpretable machine learning (ML) framework to predict marine pollution and economic losses from accident risk factors. A triple-feature selection process identified key predictors, followed by a comparative analysis of eight ML models. Random forest outperformed other models in forecasting environmental and property damage. The interpretable model was established based on the SHAP value framework, which revealed that onboard personnel count, vessel dimensions (length), and accident/ship types account for the risk factors with the most severe consequences, with environmental conditions like wind speed and air temperature contributing secondary effects. The methodology enables two critical applications: (1) environmental agencies can proactively assess accident impact through the identified risk triggers, optimizing emergency response planning, and (2) insurance providers gain data-driven risk evaluation metrics to refine premium calculations. By quantifying how human/technical factors, including crew members and vessel specifications, dominate over natural variables in accident effects, this data-driven approach provides actionable insights for maritime safety management and financial risk mitigation, achieving high prediction accuracy while maintaining model transparency through Shapley value explanations.

AB  - Timber as a construction material is experiencing its renaissance, while fire safety is a critical factor for timber-based building design. Currently, the fire resistance rating of wood-steel-wood (WSW) connections is evaluated using empirical equations derived from experimental results. However, these equations consider a limited set of parameters and lack interpretability. This paper developed an explainable machine learning (ML) model considering comprehensive parameters related to connection's configuration, based on 140 experimental and experimental-validated numerical data. The performances of various machine learning models are evaluated in terms of predicting the fire resistance rating of connections after hyperparameter tuning. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model outperforms other ML models (R-2 = 0.93) and empirical equations. The local sensitivity analysis (LSA), global sensitivity analysis (GSA), and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis are conducted based on the XGBoost model to investigate the contributions of nine parameters to the fire resistance rating. Both sensitivity analysis and SHAP analysis identify timber thickness and load ratio as the primary factors influencing fire resistance. Finally, the calibrated XGBoost model is incorporated into a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to optimize the design, aiming to minimize the self-weight of the connection while maximizing the fire resistance rating and load-carrying capacity of the connection subjected to constraints on limited dimensions.

AB  - In this study, we examine the roles of dependency, reciprocity, and informal mentorship in the prediction of long-term research collaboration in five disciplines. We use co-authorship matrixbased multivariate time series features and interpretable machine learning to train long-term collaboration prediction models and interpret the feature importance of trained models. Overall, long-term research collaboration that is defined using various standards was rare across the examined disciplines, and the prediction results were moderate to good. We found dependency, reciprocity, and informal mentorship to have different roles in different disciplines. Among the three, informal mentorship was important in predicting long-term research collaboration in Agriculture, Geology, and Library and Information Science. Reciprocity, which measures the interdependence between two researchers was important to prediction in the fields of Agriculture and Geology. Finally, dependency was important in all the disciplines with varying degrees of importance.

AB  - Landslide susceptibility mapping is essential for disaster risk management, especially in geologically sensitive regions like the Himalayas, where steep slopes, heavy rainfall, and human activities intensify risks. This study integrates eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to enhance both predictive accuracy and interpretability in Rudraprayag and Tehri Garhwal, Uttarakhand, India. Using high-resolution geospatial datasets, 20 conditioning factors were analyzed, with feature selection refined through Variable Inflation Factor (VIF) and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE). The XGBoost model achieved 92.87% accuracy and an AUC of 0.96, outperforming traditional methods. SHAP analysis identified Distance from Roads, Elevation, Rainfall, and Slope as key influencing factors. The susceptibility map categorized 13.10% of the area as high or very high susceptibility, highlighting the need for targeted mitigation. This study underscores the role of explainable AI in landslide risk assessment, providing actionable insights for disaster preparedness and sustainable development.

AB  - Bound extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) are complex, high-molecular-weight polymer mixtures that play a critical role in pore clogging, foulants adhesion, and fouling layer formation during membrane filtration, owing to their adhesive properties and gelation tendencies. In this study, a novel electrochemical anaerobic membrane bioreactor (EC-AnMBR) was constructed to investigate the effect of sludge bound-EPS solubilization on methane bioconversion and membrane fouling mitigation. During the 150-days' operation, the EC-AnMBR demonstrated remarkable performance, characterized by an exceptionally low fouling rate (transmembrane pressure (TMP) < 4.0 kPa) and high-quality effluent (COD removal > 98.2 %, protein removal > 97.7 %, and polysaccharide removal > 98.5 %). The highest methane productivity was up to 38.0 +/- 3.1 mL/L-reactor/d at the applied voltage of 0.8 V with bound-EPS solubilization, 107.6 % higher than that of the control stage (18.3 +/- 2.4 mL/L-reactor/d). Morphological and multiplex fluorescence labeling analyses revealed higher fluorescence intensities of proteins, polysaccharides, total cells and lipids on the surface of the fouling layer. In contrast, the interior exhibited increased compression density and reduced activity, likely attributable to compression effect. Under the synergistic influence of the electric field and bound-EPS solubilization, biomass characteristics exhibited a reduced propensity for membrane fouling. Furthermore, the bio-electrochemical regulation enhanced the electroactivity of microbial aggregates and enriched functional microorganisms, thereby promoting biofilm growth and direct interspecies electron transfer. Additionally, the potential hydrogenotrophic and methylotrophic methanogenesis pathways were enhanced at the cathode and anode surfaces, thereby increasing CH4 productivity. The random forest-based machine learning model analyzed the nonlinear contributions of EPS characteristics on methane productivity and TMP values, achieving R-2 values of 0.879 and 0.848, respectively. Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) analysis indicated that S-EPSPS and S-EPSPN were the most critical factors affecting CH4 productivity and membrane fouling, respectively. Partial dependence plot analysis further verified the marginal and interaction effects of different EPS layers on these outcomes. By combining continuous operation with interpretable machine learning algorithms, this study unveils the intricate impacts of EPS characteristics on methane productivity and membrane fouling behaviors, and provides new insights into sludge bound-EPS solubilization in EC-AnMBR.

AB  - We present Multiscale Extrapolative Learning Algorithm (MELA) as a novel artificial-intelligence (AI)-based data extrapolator. MELA is capable of extending temporally limited local hydroclimatic measurements at fine spatial resolution to longer periods, using remotely-sensed hydroclimatic data readily available for longer periods but at coarse spatial resolution. We demonstrate the implementation of MELA to extrapolate the monthly local soil moisture measurements at multiple depths from 2015-2021 to 1958-2021 in a semi-arid region. Such data extrapolators are imperative to generate longer historical data needed to adequately train and test AI models while enhancing the chance of capturing the effects of extreme climates on spatially variable soil moisture. The MELA-extrapolated local soil moisture subsequently allowed the construction of monthly time-series of field-scale soil moisture distributions with a normalized accuracy of 72% and prediction of countywide annual winter wheat yields - using MELA-extrapolated soil moisture data and eXplainable AI (XAI) - with a normalized accuracy of 81%. Furthermore, the XAI model ranked the predictors based on their importance in estimating winter wheat yields, in which the soil moisture near the surface and in the root zone and precipitation totals were found to be more influential than temperature on crop yields in the semi-arid region. The XAI model also unveiled the inflection points of the predictors beyond which crop yields would increase or decrease. Moreover, the AI-based analyses in conjunction with climate projections from global climate models suggest potential reductions in rainfed crop yields in the study area by 2050 and 2100 in the absence of climate-resilient mitigation and adaptation plans.

AB  - Supported by the combination of the advanced BIM technique with intelligent algorithms, this paper develops a systematic framework using explainable machine learning and multi-objective optimization to realize the automatic prediction and optimization of building energy performance towards the sustainable development goal. There are three critical parts incorporated, including the DesignBuilder simulation, BO-LGBM (Bayesian optimization-LightGBM) and an explainable method SHAP (SHapley Additive explanation)-based prediction and explanation of building energy performance, and AGE-MOEA algorithm-based multi-objective optimization (MOO) under sources of uncertainty. It has been verified in a case study for green building design. Results show that: (1) The predictive BO-LGBM model can make a highly precise prediction in agreement with the simulation data, reaching up the R2 larger than 93.4% and MAPE smaller than 2.13%. From the SHAP calculation, features related to the HAVC (Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning) system tend to contribute more to affecting the prediction results. (2) The AGE-MOEA-based optimization can identify a set of Pareto optimal solutions in simultaneously minimizing the building energy consumption, CO2 emission, and indoor thermal discomfort degree, arriving at the highest optimization rate of 13.43% under proper adjustment of certain features. (3) In the MOO task, the consideration of model and data uncertainty by prediction intervals and Monte-Carlo simulation can further increase the optimization rate by around 4.0% than the deterministic scenario, resulting in more desired strategies in optimizing the green building performance. In short, this paper enriches the area of green building development. For one thing, it raises the transparency and interpretability of machine learning to make the prediction more convincing. For another, it efficiently determines the passive and active design solutions along with the detailed profile of influential factors for green building design.

AB  - End-of-line (EOL) quality assurance of finished components has so far required additional manual inspections and burdened manufacturers with high labor costs. To automate the EOL process, in this paper a fully AI-based quality classification system is introduced. The components are automatically placed under the optical inspection system employing a robot. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used for the quality classification of the recorded images. After quality control, the component is sorted automatically in different bins depending on the quality control result. The trained CNN models achieve up to 98.7% accuracy on the test data. The classification performance of the CNN is compared with that of a rule-based approach. Additionally, the trained classification model is interpreted by an explainable AI method to make it comprehensible for humans and reassure them about its trustworthiness. This work originated from an actual industrial use case from Witzenmann GmbH. Together with the company, a demonstrator was realized.

AB  - Introduction: Synthetic lethality (SL) provides an opportunity to leverage different genetic interactions when designing synergistic combination therapies. To further explore SL-based combination therapies for cancer treatment, it is important to identify and mechanistically characterize more SL interactions. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods have recently been proposed for SL prediction, but the results of these models are often not interpretable such that deriving the underlying mechanism can be challenging. Objectives: This study aims to develop an interpretable AI framework for SL prediction and subsequently utilize it to design SL-based synergistic combination therapies. Methods: We propose a knowledge and data dual-driven AI framework for SL prediction (KDDSL). Specifically, we use gene knowledge related to the SL mechanism to guide the construction of the model and develop a method to identify the most relevant gene knowledge for the predicted results. Results: Experimental and literature-based validation confirmed a good balance between predictive and interpretable ability when using KDDSL. Moreover, we demonstrated that KDDSL could help to discover promising drug combinations and clarify associated biological processes, such as the combination of MDM2 and CDK9 inhibitors, which exhibited significant anti-cancer effects in vitro and in vivo. Conclusion: These data underscore the potential of KDDSL to guide SL-based combination therapy design. There is a need for biomedicine-focused AI strategies to combine rational biological knowledge with developed models. (c) 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Cairo University.

AB  - Belief rule base (BRB) has attracted considerable interest due to its interpretability and exceptional modeling accuracy. Generally, BRB construction relies on prior knowledge or historical data. The limitations of knowledge constrain the knowledge-based BRB and are unsuitable for use in large-scale rule bases. Data-driven techniques excel at extracting model parameters from data, thus significantly improving the accuracy of BRB. However, the previous data-based BRBs neglected the study of interpretability, and some still depend on prior knowledge or introduce additional parameters. All these factors make the BRB highly problem-specific and limit its broad applicability. To address these problems, a model-agnostic statistical BRB (MAS-BRB) modeling approach is proposed in this article. It adopts an MAS methodology for parameter extraction, ensuring that the parameters both fulfill their intended roles within the BRB framework and accurately represent complex, nonlinear data relationships. A comprehensive interpretability analysis of MAS-BRB components further confirms their compliance with established BRB interpretability standards. Experiments conducted on multiple public datasets demonstrate that MAS-BRB not only achieves improved modeling performance but also shows greater effectiveness compared to existing rule-based and traditional machine learning models.

AB  - The northern terrestrial biomes are being remarkably altered by climate change. Higher springtime temperature induces the earlier greening of vegetation, which may further influence ecosystem functions during the subsequent season. However, the response of summer net ecosystem productivity to spring vegetation greenness and phenology changes has not yet been quantified. To understand the impact of such phenological changes on terrestrial carbon sink of the following season, here we integrate remotely-sensed vegetation data and model simulations of carbon flux with an explainable machine learning approach. We find that the lagged effects of widespread earlier spring greening are increasing the summer ecosystem carbon sink across the northern vegetated areas (30 degrees to 90 degrees N) from 1982 to 2015. In particular, response disparities exist in non-agricultural biomes, and the vegetation with moderate tree coverage is more sensitive to earlier spring greening. Furthermore, modest tree restoration can strengthen the beneficial effects of earlier spring greening. This study improves our understanding of interseasonal vegetation-climate-carbon coupling that drives the key ecological feedback within climate change projections.
   Northern Hemisphere greening in early spring stimulated biomass production in forest ecosystems more strongly than in semi-arid grasslands during summer over the 1982-2015 period, according to an analysis based on explainable machine learning of satellite-based data and model simulations.

AB  - The relationship between coronary heart disease (CHD) and complex urban built environments remains a subject of considerable uncertainty. The development of predictive models via machine learning to explore the underlying mechanisms of this association, as well as the formulation of intervention policies and planning strategies, has emerged as a pivotal area of research. A cross-sectional dataset of hospital admissions for CHD over the course of a year from a hospital in Dalian City, China, was assembled and matched with multi-source built environment data via residential addresses. This study evaluates five machine learning models, including decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and support vector machine (SVM), and compares them with multiple linear regression models. The results show that DT, RF, and XGBoost exhibit superior predictive capabilities, with all R2 values exceeding 0.70. The DT model performed the best, with an R2 value of 0.818, and the best performance was based on metrics such as MAE and MSE. Additionally, using explainable AI techniques, this study reveals the contribution of different built environment factors to CHD and identifies the significant factors influencing CHD in cold regions, ranked as age, Digital Elevation Model (DEM), house price (HP), sky view factor (SVF), and interaction factors. Stratified analyses by age and gender show variations in the influencing factors for different groups: for those under 60 years old, Road Density is the most influential factor; for the 61-70 age group, house price is the top factor; for the 71-80 age group, age is the most significant factor; for those over 81 years old, building height is the leading factor; in males, GDP is the most influential factor; and in females, age is the most influential factor. This study explores the feasibility and performance of machine learning in predicting CHD risk in the built environment of cold regions and provides a comprehensive methodology and workflow for predicting cardiovascular disease risk based on refined neighborhood-level built environment factors, offering scientific support for the construction of sustainable healthy cities.

AB  - Objectives: The agricultural sector in many South Asian countries, including Bangladesh and India, plays a pivotal role in the economy, with a significant portion of the population dependent on it for livelihood. However, farmers often encounter challenges such as unpredictable weather conditions, soil variability, and natural disasters like floods and erosion, leading to substantial crop losses and financial strain. Despite government subsidies, many farmers struggle to sustain their livelihoods, resulting in a decline in interest in agriculture. Our focus lies on predicting the classification of various crops, including rice, jute, maize, and others, based on a combination of soil and weather features. Soil features, including Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, and pH levels, along with weather variables such as Temperature, Humidity, and Rainfall, are utilized as inputs for the predictive model. Methods: In this study, we address the critical issue of crop prediction by leveraging advanced machine-learning techniques and integrating genetic algorithms into the predictive model. Our proposed approach employs a hybrid methodology, where a Genetic Algorithm is utilized to optimize the hyperparameters of the model, enhancing its performance and robustness. Specifically, we employ a Random Forest classifier, a powerful ensemble learning technique, to classify the class labels associated with 22 different types of crops. Findings: The model's accuracy is evaluated extensively, demonstrating a remarkable accuracy rate of 99.3%. Additionally, we utilized Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explaination(LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations(SHAP) Explainable AI (XAI) methods to interpret and validate the model's predictions. Novelty: The study presents a unique method for crop prediction that combines machine learning (ML) with genetic algorithms (GAs). The goal of this integration is to improve crop forecast models' interpretability and accuracy. Due to the nature of local approximation LIME may yield contradictory answers. On the other hand, for sophisticated models and extensive datasets, SHAP can be computationally costly. By improving feature selection and model parameters, the integration of GAs with ML models overcomes these drawbacks and produces predictions that are more reliable and accurate. The high accuracy achieved by our system underscores its potential to mitigate crop losses and enhance agricultural productivity, thereby contributing to the sustainability and prosperity of the agricultural sector in any country.

AB  - Understanding the determinants of urban transportation mode choice is crucial for developing efficient, sustainable, and green transit systems in metropolitan areas. This study proposes a comprehensive framework that integrates big data and machine learning techniques, leveraging a large dataset comprising over ten million trips to investigate the factors influencing transportation mode choice under clear competition during peak hours. We examine how travel attributes, land use, network centrality, and demographics shape the choices of subway, bus, taxi, and bike-share users. Employing oversampling and interpretable techniques, our analysis reveals that travel attributes significantly influence transportation mode choices, especially for public transportation. Additionally, the marginal effects of the features on mode choice are efficiently captured. Interaction effects between travel time and cost further highlight the complex trade-offs travelers make under different choice probabilities. The findings underscore the importance of integrating diverse data sources for a holistic understanding of urban transportation dynamics.

AB  - The quality control of thermally modified wood and identifying heat treatment intensity using nondestructive testing methods are critical tasks. This study used near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and machine learning modeling to classify thermally modified wood. NIR spectra were collected from the surfaces of untreated and thermally treated (at 170 degrees C, 212 degrees C, and 230 degrees C) western hemlock samples. An explainable machine learning approach was practiced using a TreeNet gradient boosting machine. No dimensionality reduction was performed to better explain the feature ranking results obtained from the model and provide insight into the critical wavelengths contributing to the performance of classification models. NIR spectra in the ranges of 1100-2500 nm, 1400-2500 nm, and 1700-2500 nm were fed into the TreeNet model, which resulted in classification accuracy values (test data) of 94.35%, 89.29%, and 84.52%, respectively. Feature ranking analysis revealed that when using the range of 1100-2500 nm, the changes in wood color resulted in the highest variation in NIR reflectance amongst treatments. As a result, associated features were given higher importance by TreeNet. Limiting the wavelength range increased the significance of features related to water or wood chemistry; however, these predictive models were not as accurate as the one benefiting from the impact of wood color change on the NIR spectra. The developed framework could be applied to different applications in which NIR spectra are used for wood characterization and quality control to provide improved insights into selected NIR wavelengths when developing a machine learning model.

AB  - Understanding the relationship between the demand for public transportation and land use is critical to promoting public-transportation-oriented urban development. Taking Beijing as an example, we took the Public Transportation Index (PTI) during the working day's early peak hours as the dependent variable. And 15 land use and built environment variables were selected as the independent variables according to the "7D" built environment dimensions. According to the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP), the size and shape of the spatial units will affect the aggregation results of the dependent variable and the independent variables. To find the ideal spatial unit division method, we assess how well the nonlinear model fits several spatial units. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) was utilized to investigate the nonlinear effects of the built environment on PTI and threshold effects based on the ideal spatial unit. The results show that (1) the best spatial unit division method is based on traffic analysis zones (TAZs); (2) the top four explanatory variables affecting PTI are, in order: mean travel distance, residential density, subway station density, and public services density; (3) there are nonlinear relationships and significant threshold effects between the land use variables and PTI. The priority regeneration TAZs were identified according to the intersection analysis of the low PTI TAZs set and the PTI-sensitive TAZs set based on different land use variables. Prioritized urban regeneration TAZs require targeted strategies, and the results of the study may provide a scientific basis for proposing strategies to renew land use to increase PTI.

AB  - Global warming has significantly increased the frequency and intensity of extreme events, such as drought and drought-flood abrupt alternation (DFAA). Vegetation, a crucial component of terrestrial ecosystems, contributes greatly to agricultural production and economic development. Assessing the impacts of droughts and DFAA on vegetation is essential for ecological environment protection, food security, and economic development. This study combines the random forest model with Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) values to create an interpretable machine learning model, which is then coupled with the R-Vine Copula function to explore the combined effects of drought (using nonstationary drought indexes) and DFAA (using the SDFAI: short-cycle drought flood abrupt alteration index) on vegetation in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) from 1981 to 2019. The key findings are as follows: (1) Drought events intensified, the risk of flood-to-drought decreased, the risk of drought-to-flood increased, and net primary productivity (NPP) showed an upward trend; (2) The relative contributions to NPP were NSPEI (21.0 %), SDFAI (31.4 %), and SSMI (47.6 %); (3) A strong upper tail dependence occurred between SSMI and NPP, and a strong lower tail dependence occurred between SDFAI and SSMI. When SSMI acted as an intermediary variable, the indirect correlation between SDFAI and NPP was strong; (4) In flood-to-drought events, the proportions of SHAP<0 and SHAP>0 were 24 % and 76 %, respectively, indicating an antagonistic role of flood-to-drought in promoting vegetation growth in the CPEC. In drought-to-flood events, the corresponding proportions were 73 % and 27 %, respectively, indicating a synergistic effect of drought-to-flood in inhibiting vegetation growth. This study enhances the understanding of the mechanisms by which DFAA impacts vegetation and provides a novel approach for exploring the combined effects of multiple extreme events on vegetation.

AB  - Global climate change is rooted in the imbalance between carbon sources and sinks, and net-zero greenhouse gas emissions should focus not only on the source-side drivers but also on the sink-side influencing factors. Taking the county-level administrative districts in China as the sample, this study uses machine learning models to fit the relationship between socioeconomic development (SED) and net primary productivity (NPP) of terrestrial eco-systems. Moreover, it identifies key influencing factors and their effects based on the SHapley Additive exPla-nations (SHAP) algorithm. The results show that the districts with low terrestrial NPP show the characteristics of agglomeration distribution. The eight key factors, in order, are as follows: agricultural development level, lati-tude, population size, longitude, animal husbandry development level, economic scale, time trend and indus-trialization level. In this study, via SHAP interaction plots, we found that the effects of population, economic growth, and industrialization on terrestrial NPP are regionally heterogeneous; via cluster analysis, we found the stage characteristics of the mode of SED affecting terrestrial NPP. Therefore, the conservation of terrestrial NPP needs to be combined with the stage changes of SED, as well as inter-regional differences, to develop a regionally coordinated and time-coherent ecological carbon sink conservation plan.

AB  - This study developed explainable machine learning (ML) models to enhance outdoor thermal comfort (OTC) prediction in traditional villages, aiming to improve resident health and rural tourism. A village-specific OTC dataset was established through field experiments, and eight ML algorithms were utilized to predict thermal sensation (TSV), comfort (TCV), and acceptance (TAV) votes, with performance compared to empirical and mechanism models. Feature engineering, data resampling, and hyperparameter optimization were applied to optimize ML models, while the Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) framework with dataset segmentation addressed explainability challenges. Results demonstrated that: (1) ML models, particularly XGBoost (XGB), outperformed empirical and mechanism models in TSV predictions. (2) Feature engineering and Bayesian optimization achieved maximum accuracy improvement of 13.6 % and 4.8 %, respectively, while SMOTE resampling enhanced the prediction of minority classes. (3) Meteorological impacts on TSV, TCV, and TAV exhibited seasonal variations, with air temperature (Ta) dominating in summer and global radiation (G) prevailing in winter. Non-meteorological factors, including individual and psychological characteristics, showed divergent adaptation between tourists and residents. These findings offer valuable insights for optimizing village layouts and tourism schedules while advancing data-driven OTC management frameworks. This study bridges ML applications with traditional village sustainability, offering a foundation for intelligent built-environment science.

AB  - Mobile device location data (MDLD) contain population-representative, fine-grained travel de-mand information, facilitating opportunities to validate established relations between travel de-mand and underlying factors from a big data perspective. Using the nationwide census block group (CBG)-level population inflow derived from MDLD as the proxy of travel demand, this study examines its relations with various factors including socioeconomics, demographics, land use, and CBG attributes. A host of tree-based machine learning (ML) models and interpretation techniques (feature importance, partial dependence plot (PDP), accumulated local effect (ALE), SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)) are extensively compared to determine the best model architecture and justify interpretation robustness. Empirical results show that: 1) Boosting trees perform the best among all models, followed by bagging trees, single trees, and linear regressions. (2) Feature importance holds consistently among different tree-based models but is influenced by measures of importance and hyperparameter settings. 3) Pronounced nonlinearities, threshold effects, and interaction effects are observed in relations among population inflow and most of its determinants. 4) Compared with PDP, ALE and SHAP plots are more reliable in the presence of outliers, feature dependency, and local heterogeneity. Taken together, techniques introduced in this study can either be integrated into customary travel demand models to enhance model ac-curacy or serve as interpretation tools that offer a comprehensive understanding of intricate relations.

AB  - To ensure a safe environment for occupants, evaluating the physical status and service performance of existing buildings is essential. However, large-scale building condition assessment usually relies on the expertise and judgment of inspectors, which can be costly and laborious due to unclear priorities, ambiguous procedures, and ineffective operations. To address these challenges, this study proposes an explainable machine learning-based screening model for the anomalous safety condition among existing buildings, narrowing down the scope of buildings requiring further and detailed inspection and monitoring. Initially, an imbalanced dataset of 18,090 survey reports of existing buildings of safe and unsafe labels is collected. Then, the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) is conducted to balance the dataset. Subsequently, seven machine learning models are trained utilizing 10-fold cross-validation with grid search. Findings reveal that, based on the balanced dataset, the performance of ensemble learning models is significantly better than that of individual machine learning models. Specifically, the XGBoost model achieves the highest performance, with a macro-F1 of 98.49%, G-mean value of 98.49%, and accuracy of 98.49%. The final predictive model (the SMOTE-based XGBoost model) is explained using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Service year, structure, and location are the three most important features influencing building structural safety. This study represents a promising approach for automated screening of the anomalous safety condition among buildings, optimizing resource allocation, and enhancing the effectiveness in decision-making for construction and maintenance.

AB  - Changes in rainfall seasonality can have far-reaching impacts on the livelihood of population, agricultural production, and ecosystem sustainability. However, the changes in rainfall seasonality and associated climatic causes are largely unclear, especially in global land monsoon regions. Here, we analyzed the variations of rainfall seasonality during 1960-2022, and explored the possible effects of global climate teleconnections (CTs) on rainfall seasonality changes in global land monsoon regions using interpretable machine learning and multivariate wavelet coherency method. The results show that rainfall seasonality weakens significantly in northeastern South Asian, northeastern South American, and most parts of southern North African and South African monsoon regions, but enhances significantly in southern South Asian, northern North African, and southwestern South American monsoon regions. Rainfall seasonality also experiences an abrupt change in all hotspots during 1960-2022. We also find that many CTs are nonmonotonically related to rainfall seasonality in these hotspots, and the key CTs that explain the variations in rainfall seasonality differ across different hotspots using interpretable machine learning. The coupled influences of the key CTs on rainfall seasonality are also significant at certain scales during different periods in these hotspots. However, the key CTs have undergone changes, with stronger impacts on rainfall seasonality in almost all hotspots since 1990s. The findings of this study offer a robust scientific foundation that significantly contributes to enhancing agricultural productivity, fostering ecosystem sustainability, and promoting water resources management.

AB  - We explore the potential of machine learning (ML) models applied in two financial risk management areas, i.e., credit risk management and financial risk hedging, through two practical use cases. This comparative study starts with the issue of explainability in complex ML models used in peer-to-peer lending for credit risk management. The first use case examines the limitations of using Kernel-SHAP with dependent features and evaluates different methods for estimating these dependencies using the Lending Club dataset. Our results suggest that accounting for feature dependence improves the understanding and robustness of prediction explanations. The second use case investigates a dynamic method for hedging foreign exchange risk in international equity portfolios, emphasizing the importance of accurate forecasts of currency returns. The analysis demonstrates that predictions yielded by ML models can significantly enhance the hedging of portfolios against currency risk. These findings highlight the transformative potential of advanced ML models in financial risk management, showcasing their capability to improve financial risk measurement and management. Further, our study outlines future research directions to advance this field.

AB  - Micro-mobility plays an increasingly vital role in urban transportation, yet research on the micro-mobility behavior resilience remains limited. This study employs shared bicycle data from Shenzhen before, during, and after extreme weather events to develop a novel framework for assessing the micro-mobility behavior resilience. First, the Soft DTW-based K-medoids time series clustering method was employed to explore dynamic spatiotemporal patterns of community response and recovery within sub-districts, traffic analysis zones (TAZs), and cell grids. This analysis revealed the emergence of three distinct patterns across various community spatial and temporal scales. Then, resilience was quantified using the resilience triangle principle, with impact of the built environment analyzed through the GW-lightGBM model. The model using TAZs as research unit performed the best. Finally, the study analyzed the spatially heterogeneous effects and nonlinear associations of the built environment on micro-mobility behavior resilience within the top-performing model. Socioeconomic attributes were found to have the highest average contribution to micro-mobility resilience, with road density and rooftop density also playing significant roles. The findings offer valuable insights data-driven approaches to quantify and analyze disaster behaviors, establish resilience measurement standards, and devise planning strategies to optimize local resource allocation and cultivate highly resilient cities.

AB  - Automated external defibrillator resources (AEDRs) are the crux of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) responses, enhancing safe and sustainable urban environments. However, existing studies failed to consider the nexus between built environment (BE) features and AEDRs. Can explainable machine-learning (ML) methods reveal the BE-AEDR nexus? This study applied an Optuna-based extreme gradient boosting (OP_XGBoost) decision tree model with SHapely Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and partial dependence plots (PDPs) aiming to scrutinize the spatial effects, relative importance, and non-linear impact of BE features on AEDR intensity across grid and block urban patterns in Tianjin Downtown, China. The results indicated, that (1) marginally, the AEDR intensity was most influenced by the service coverage (SC) at grid scale and nearby public service facility density (NPSF_D) at block scale, while synergistically, it was shaped by comprehensive accessibility and land-use interactions with the prioritized block pattern; (2) block-level granularity and (3) non-linear interdependencies between BE features and AEDR intensity existed as game-changers. The findings suggested an effective and generalizable approach to capture the complex interplay of the BE-AEDR and boost the AED deployment by setting health at the heart of the urban development framework.

AB  - New ternary gold alloys with low resistivities (rho) were screened out via an interpretable machine learning strategy by using the support vector regression (SVR) model integrated with SHAP analysis. The correlation coefficient (R) and the root mean square error (RMSE) of test set were 0.876 and 0.302, respectively, indicating the strong generalization ability of the model. The average rho of top 10 candidates was 1.22x10(-7) Omega m, which was 41% lower than the known minimum of 2.08x10(-7) Omega m. The outputs of SVR model were analyzed with the critical SHAP values including first ionization energy of C-site (584 kJ.mol(-1)), electronegativity of C-site (1.72) and the second ionization energy of B-site (1135 kJ . mol(-1)), respectively. Moreover, an online web server was developed to share the model at http://materials-data-mining.com/onlineservers/wxdaualloy.

AB  - The built environment has been widely recognized as a critical determinant of physical activity among older adults. However, urban-rural disparities and the non-linear effects of environmental features remain underexplored. Using interpretable machine learning (random forest model) on nationwide representative data from 2526 older adults in the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) database, this study identified both common and distinct risk factors for insufficient moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) across diverse urban and rural contexts. The results revealed a location-based gradient in physical activity insufficiency: rural areas < suburban areas < central urban areas. Rural older adults faced greater constraints from safety concerns and transportation accessibility limitations. In comparison, urban older adults would benefit from targeted improvements in built environment quality, particularly elevator accessibility and diverse public activity spaces. Furthermore, non-linear relationships were observed between built environment features and physical activity, elucidating the "density paradox": while moderate urban compactness promoted active behaviors, excessive density (>24,000 persons/km(2)), perceived overcrowding, and over-proximity to specific facilities (<1 km) were linked to reduced MVPA. These findings underscore the necessity for differentiated policy interventions in urban and rural settings to address the distinct environmental needs of older adults. Meanwhile, in urban planning, it is crucial that we balance spatial compactness and functional diversity within optimal thresholds for creating sustainable and inclusive built environments. Although a compact design may enhance mobility, equal attention must be paid to preventing spatial disorder from over-densification.

AB  - Banking is a dynamic industry that places significant importance on risk management, requiring accurate and interpretable AI models to make transparent lending decisions. This study introduces a groundbreaking approach that combines a multistage ensemble technique with a 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. The algorithm not only delivers superior classification performance but also offers interpretable explanations for its decisions. The algorithm is designed with multiple strategic steps to enhance model performance without sacrificing explainability. Thorough experiments were conducted using datasets from private banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) in India to evaluate the algorithm's performance. It was compared against various state-of-the-art models, demonstrating remarkable precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy values of 0.994, 0.992, 0.993, and 0.991, respectively. This outperformed competing models like homogeneous deep ensembles, 1D CNN, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Furthermore, individual borrower dataset evaluations confirmed the proposed algorithm's consistency and efficiency, achieving precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy values of 0.960, 0.961, 0.952, and 0.964, respectively. The research emphasizes the effectiveness of the explanatory integration decision process, wherein the Explainable Multistage Ensemble 1D CNN not only provides enhanced credit risk prediction but also facilitates transparent and interpretable lending decisions. The algorithm's ability to offer understandable explanations empowers financial institutions to make well-informed lending decisions, reduce credit risk, and foster a more stable and inclusive financial ecosystem.

TI  - N-Beats architecture for explainable forecasting of multi-dimensional poultry data
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - The agricultural economy heavily relies on poultry production, making accurate forecasting of poultry data crucial for optimizing revenue, streamlining resource utilization, and maximizing productivity. This research introduces a novel application of the N-BEATS architecture for multi-dimensional poultry data forecasting with enhanced interpretability through an integrated Explainable AI (XAI) framework. Leveraging its advanced capabilities in time series modeling, N-BEATS is applied to predict multiple facets of poultry disease diagnostics using a multivariate dataset comprising key environmental parameters. The methodology empowers decision-making in poultry farm management by providing transparent and interpretable forecasts. Experimental results demonstrate that N-BEATS outperforms conventional deep learning models, including LSTM, GRU, RNN, and CNN, across various error metrics, achieving MAE of 0.172, RMSE of 0.313, MSLE of 0.042, R-squared of 0.034, and RMSLE of 0.204. The positive R-squared value indicates the model's robustness against underfitting and overfitting, surpassing the performance of other models with negative R-squared values. This study establishes N-BEATS as a superior and interpretable solution for complex, multi-dimensional forecasting challenges in poultry production, with significant implications for enhancing predictive analytics in agriculture.

AB  - Introduction: Roadway crash data are very rare and occur randomly, therefore there are several challenges to developing a crash prediction model for real-time traffic safety management. Recently, to resolve the problem of crash data sample size, researchers have conducted studies on crash data augmentation using machine learning techniques for developing safety evaluation models. However, it's important to incorporate the specific characteristics of crash data into augmentation and crash risk assessment, as these characteristics vary depending on spatial and temporal conditions. Method: Therefore, this study developed a real-time crash risk model in three stages. First, crash data were clustered to define heterogeneous crash risk situations and then, key variables were derived by the ensemble and explainable artificial intelligence techniques, Boruta-SHAP. Second, augmentation of each clustered crash data was performed using oversampling techniques including Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN), which can consider each crash risk cluster's characteristics. Finally, crash risk models were developed and compared with other crash risk models developed by using binary logistic regression model (BLM), Random Forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Results: The results showed that the CGAN-based XGBoost model has the best performance and the variable of the temporal speed difference at 10-minute intervals and the precipitation variable have a large impact on crash risk prediction. This paper emphasizes that crash risk characteristics must be distinguished in crash risk prediction and provides new insights into addressing the imbalance data issue within crash and non-crash datasets.

AB  - The increasing complexity of supply chain finance poses significant challenges to effective credit risk assessment. Traditional black-box models often fail to provide insights into the factors driving credit risk, which is essential for stakeholders when making informed decisions. By conducting analysis of interpretable machine learning models, the study evaluated their performance in assessing credit risks. Specifically, we applied Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF), Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for risk assessment. Our methodology included an ablation experiment along with utilizing Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) to elucidate the contribution and significance of specific risk factors. The results indicated that the asset-liability ratio, cash ratio, and quick ratio notably influence credit risk. This study clarified the applicability and limitations of various models, highlighting the superior performance and interpretability of XGBoost through the SHAP algorithm. Ultimately, the insights from this study provided valuable guidance for companies and financial institutions, fostering more sustainable allocation of financial resources.

AB  - Soilcrete is an innovative construction material made by combining naturally occurring earth materials with cement. It can be effectively used in areas where other construction materials are not readily available due to financial or environmental reasons since soilcrete is made from readily available natural clay. It can also help to cut down the greenhouse gas emissions from the construction industry by encouraging the use of resources that are locally available. Thus, it is imperative to reliably predict different properties of soilcrete since the accurate determination of these properties is crucial for the widespread use of soilcrete materials. However, the laboratory determination of these properties is subjected to significant time and resource constraints. As a result, this research was undertaken to provide empirical prediction models for the density, shrinkage, and strain of soilcrete mixes using two machine learning algorithms: Gene Expression Programming (GEP) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB). The analysis revealed that XGB-based predictions correlated more with real-life values than GEP having training R2=0.999\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${\text{R}}<^>{2}=0.999$$\end{document} for both density and shrinkage prediction and R2=0.944\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${\text{R}}<^>{2}=0.944$$\end{document} for strain prediction. Moreover, several explanatory analyses including individual conditional expectation (ICE) analysis and shapely analysis were done on the XGB model which showed that water-to-binder ratio, metakaolin content, and modulus of elasticity are some of the most important variables for forecasting soilcrete materials properties. Furthermore, an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) has been developed for effective utilization in civil engineering industry to forecast these properties of soilcrete materials.

AB  - Aim Despite extensive studies of phenological shifts in migration by climate change and driving factors of migration, a few issues remain unresolved. In particular, little is known about the complex effects of driving factors on migration with interactions and nonlinearity, and partitioning of the effects of factors into spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal effects. Here, we aim to elucidate migration pattern as well as its driving factors under climate change.Location Western North Pacific.Taxon North Pacific spiny dogfish Squalus suckleyi.Methods We first examined long-term changes in the timing and geographic location of migration by applying the Barrier model, a spatio-temporal model, to c. 5-decade time series data (1972-2019) for the presence/absence of spiny dogfish in the western North Pacific. We then evaluated the spatial, temporal and spatio-temporal effects of driving factors (fish productivity, sea surface temperature [SST], depth and magnetic field) on seasonal occurrence patterns using a machine learning model and an interpretable machine learning technique.Results The migration area did not change over c. 5-decades, whereas the migration timing advanced by a month after 2000. The spatial effects of magnetic field and depth were consistently large and the spatial and spatio-temporal effects of SST increased in the migration season, even though the temporal effect of SST was consistently weak.Main Conclusions The migration area of spiny dogfish was stable over time because of the effect of magnetic field and a strong preference for submarine topography, whereas the migration timing advanced as a result of tracking a suitable location based on SST, which increased sharply after 2000. Therefore, temperature and other factors simultaneously influence migration under climate change, highlighting the importance of considering both biotic and abiotic factors and understanding the underlying processes in predicting future impacts of climate change on species distribution.

AB  - PurposeThe extraction of a subset of informative genes is a crucial preprocessing step that not only refines the complexity of expression data but also forms the foundation for accurate classification and prognosis of breast cancer based on histologic grade and molecular insights.MethodsCFS-BFS and CONSISTENCY-BFS stand out as the two most effective gene selection algorithms developed. A groundbreaking 2-Stage Gene Selection (GeS) algorithm has emerged to pinpoint essential genes for accurately predicting breast cancer subtypes. Initially, CFS-BFS eliminates a majority of noisy, inappropriate, and redundant genes, followed by the application of CONSISTENCY-BFS. The 2-Stage Gene Selection strategy enhances the algorithm's effectiveness, addressing uncertainties present in CFS-BFS.ResultsSurprisingly, Hidden Weight Na & iuml;ve Bayes yields more reliable and precise results when integrated with the 2-Stage Gene Selection approach. Promising outcomes are achieved in terms of recall (87.36%), precision (87.5%), f-score (87.3%), and fallout (7.5%) through the utilisation of six microarray gene expression datasets in the experiment. The top four genes acquired are E2F3, PSMC3IP, GINS1, and PLAGL2.ConclusionPrecision treatments for breast cancer may target GINS1, E2F3, PLAG2, and PSMC3IP. Four genes have a poor prognosis. High E2F3 expression may suggest aggressive breast cancer and treatment resistance. PSMC3IP expression may be linked to worse prognosis owing to its function in cell survival and resistance. Breast cancer with high GINS1 expression is more aggressive and has a poorer prognosis. Cell proliferation and tumour growth may increase with GINS1 expression. PLAGL2 has both oncogenic and tumor-suppressive roles in breast cancer genesis and progression. Explainable AI (XAI) in breast cancer enhances patient comprehension, guarantees quality control, finds critical aspects for diagnosis and therapy, and complies with regulatory standards. Significant genes standing in breast cancer is determined through validation using permutation importance and SHAP values.

AB  - Climate change is driving an increase in extreme weather events, leading to a growing risk of urban flooding. Accurate and rapid forecasting of critical infrastructure (CI) flood variables, along with the identification of flood source areas (FSA), is crucial for effective urban flood risk management. Conventional approaches for identifying FSAs are often impractical for advanced, high-resolution fully distributed hydrodynamic models. This study provides a new approach for FSA identification in complex urban flood models using interpretable deep learning (IDL). Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (GradCAM) were used to develop a surrogate model for the Distributed Hydrodynamic Model for Urban (DHM Urban), which includes a rain-on-grid overland flow mechanism. The results show that the deep learning model can rapidly and accurately simulate critical flood variables and identify corresponding FSAs at CI locations under various rainfall scenarios. Tests with real rainfall data showed that the MAE and RMSE for the regression simulation of maximum inundation depth were 3.20 cm and 3.77 cm, respectively. With an explained variance of 92.86 % and computation times in the sub-second range, the model demonstrates both high accuracy and efficiency. The model's interpretability ensures that its focus aligns with hydrological expertise, addressing challenges related to variable and discontinuous FSAs. Additionally, the paper highlights the importance of using chaotic rainfall patterns when developing interpretable surrogate models and demonstrates that DCNNs can implicitly encode location information in position-dependent tasks. IDL addresses the limitations of data-driven models by not only predicting outcomes but also explaining the underlying reasons, offering a unified solution for both rapid flood simulation and adaptive FSA identification.

AB  - Accurately predicting the energy use intensity (EUI) of office buildings is essential for optimizing energy efficiency and implementing sustainable building practices. This study integrated green building information modelling (green BIM) with advanced machine learning (ML) techniques to develop EUI prediction models tailored to Taiwanese office buildings. A data set of 1006 unique BIM models was generated using Green Building Studio, which calculated the EUI for diverse configurations of architectural and environmental variables. The forensic-based investigation algorithm was employed for hyperparameter optimization, and it considerably enhanced the performance of the developed boosting-based ensemble models. Of all models, XGBoost exhibited the highest accuracy and robustness, achieving the lowest root-mean-square error (37.98 +/- 11.81 MJ/m2/year) and mean absolute percentage error (1.86 % +/- 0.50 %) for the test set, thereby outperforming the random forest, bagging, and adaptive weighted blended ensemble models. Feature importance analysis, conducted using the SHapley Additive exPlanations technique, revealed that the number of stories, geographical location, and floor area are the factors most strongly affecting EUI, consistent with real-world expectations. Overall, this study highlights the effectiveness of combining green-BIM-driven simulations, advanced ML models, and interpretability techniques to address energy efficiency challenges in office buildings. The findings provide actionable insights for architects, engineers, and policymakers seeking to design energyefficient buildings and implement targeted energy-saving strategies.

AB  - Understanding the built environment's impact on metro ridership is essential for developing targeted strategies for built environment renewal. Taking into consideration the limitations of existing studies, such as not proposing targeted strategies, using unified pedestrian catchment areas (PCA), and not determining the model's accuracy, Beijing was divided into three zones from inside to outside by the distribution pattern of metro stations. Three PCAs were assumed for each zone and a total of 27 PCA combinations. The study compared the accuracy of the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) and several machine learning models under each PCA combination to determine the model to be used in this study and the recommended PCA combination for the three zones. Under the recommended PCA combinations for the three zones, the model with the highest accuracy was used to explore the built environment's impact on metro ridership. Finally, prioritized stations for renewal were identified based on ridership and the built environment's impact on metro ridership. The results are as follows: (1) The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model has a higher accuracy and was appropriate for this study. The recommended PCA combination for the three zones in Beijing was 1000 m_1200 m_1800 m. (2) During the morning peak hours, the density of office and apartment facilities greatly influenced the ridership, with a strong threshold effect and spatial heterogeneity. Our research framework also provides a new way for other cities to determine the scope of Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) and proposes a new decision-making method for improving the vibrancy of metro stations.

AB  - The logic of an artificial intelligence (AI) model derived from machine learning algorithms and domain-specific data is analogous to an expert's perception of a complex problem. Human insight based on know-how and experience also provides the best clue to verify such analytical models generalized from data. To facilitate the acceptance and implementation of AI by industry professionals, we explored the least complicated form of model that still is sufficient to represent the complexities of real-world problems. This research established a framework to apply the M5P model tree in the context of producing explainable AI for practical applications. The explanatory information derived from M5P (a decision tree with linear regressions at leaf nodes) is instrumental in explaining how the more complicated AI model reasons for the same problem, illuminating the sufficiency of problem definition and data quality, and distinguishing valid submodels from invalid ones in the obtained model tree. A steel fabrication labor cost-estimating case and a concrete strength development case were given for method validation and application demonstration. (C) 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Fast and accurate identification of potato plant traits is essential for formulating effective cultivation strategies. The integration of spectral cameras on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has demonstrated appealing potential, facilitating non-invasive investigations on a large scale by providing valuable features for construction of machine learning models. Nevertheless, interpreting these features, and those derived from them, remains a challenge, limiting confident utilization in real-world applications. In this study, the interpretability of machine learning models is addressed by employing SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) to better understand the modeling process. The XGBoost model was trained on a multispectral dataset of potato plants and evaluated on various tasks, i.e. variety classification, physiological measures estimation, and detection of early blight disease. To optimize its performance, nearly 100 vegetation indices and over 500 auto-generated features were utilized for training. The results indicate successful separation of plant varieties with up to 97.10% accuracy, estimation of physiological values with a maximum R2 and rNRMSE of 0.57 and 0.129, respectively, and detection of early blight with an F1 score of 0.826. Furthermore, both UMAP and SHAP proved beneficial for comprehensive analysis. UMAP visual observations closely corresponded to computed metrics, enhancing confidence for variety differentiation. Concurrently, SHAP identified the most informative features - green, red edge, and NIR channels - for most tasks, aligning tightly with existing literature. This study highlights potential improvements in farming efficiency, crop yield, and sustainability, and promotes the development of interpretable machine learning models for remote sensing applications.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by limited effective treatments, underscoring the critical need for early detection and diagnosis to improve intervention outcomes. This study integrates various bioinformatics methodologies with interpretable machine learning to identify reliable biomarkers for AD diagnosis and treatment. By leveraging differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and construction of Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) Networks, we meticulously analyzed the AD dataset from the GEO database to pinpoint Hub genes. Subsequently, various machine learning algorithms were employed to construct diagnostic models, which were then elucidated using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). To visualize our findings, we generated an insightful bioinformatics map of 10 Hub genes. We then conducted experimental validation on less-studied Hub genes, revealing significant differential mRNA expression of MYH9 and RHOQ in an AD cell model. Finally, we explored the biological significance of these two genes at the single-cell transcriptome level. This study not only introduces interactive SHAP panels for precise decision-making in AD but also offers novel insights into the identification of AD biomarkers through interpretable machine learning diagnostic models. Particularly, MYH9 has emerged as a promising new potential biomarker, pointing the way towards enhanced diagnostic accuracy and personalized therapeutic strategies for AD. Although the mRNA expression patterns of RHOQ are opposite in AD cell models and human brain tissue samples, the role of RHOQ in AD remains worthy of further exploration due to the diversity and complexity of biological molecular regulation.

AB  - Adequate control of shield machine parameters to ensure the safety and efficiency of shield construction is a difficult and complex problem. To address this problem, this paper proposes a hybrid intelligent optimization framework that combines interpretable machine learning, intelligent optimization algorithms, and multi-objective optimization and decision-making methods. The nonlinear relationship between the input parameters and ground settlement (GS) is fitted based on the light gradient boosting machine (LGBM), and the effect of the input parameters on GS is analysed based on SHapley additive exPlanation for further feature selection. Subsequently, the hyper-parameters of LGBM were determined based on the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) to better fit the input-output relationship. On this basis, a multi-objective intelligent optimization model is established to solve the optimized operating parameters of shield machine by non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution to reduce GS and improve drilling efficiency. The results demonstrate that the SSA-LGBM model predicts GS with high accuracy, exhibiting an RMSE of 4.775, a VAF of 0.930 and an R2 of 0.931. These metrics collectively reflect the model's excellent performance in prediction accuracy, ability to explain data variability, and control of prediction bias. The multi-objective optimization model is effective in optimizing two objectives, and the improvement can reach up to 39.38%; at the same time, the model has high scalability and can also be applied to three or more objectives. The intelligent optimization framework for shield construction parameters proposed in this paper can generate the optimal parameter combinations for shield machine manipulation, and provide reference and guidance when there are conflicting optimization objectives.

AB  - In spite of enormous improvements in vehicle safety, roadway design, and operations, there is still an excessive amount of traffic crashes resulting in injuries and major productivity losses. Despite the many studies on factors of crash frequency and injury severity, there is still further research to be conducted. Tree and utility pole/other pole related (TUOP) crashes present approximately 12 to 15% of all roadway departure (RwD) fatal crashes in the U.S. The count of TUOP crashes comprise nearly 22% of all fatal crashes in Louisiana. From 2010 to 2016, there were 55,857 TUOP crashes reported in Louisiana. Individually examining each of these crash reports is not a re-alistic option to investigate crash factors. Therefore, this study employed text mining and interpretable machine learning (IML) techniques to analyze all TUOP crashes (with available crash narratives) that occurred in Louisiana from 2010 to 2016. This study has two major goals: 1) to develop a framework for applying machine learning models to classify injury levels from unstructured textual content, and 2) to apply an IML framework that pro -vides probability measures of keywords and their association with the injury classification. The present study employed three machine learning algorithms in the classification of injury levels based on the crash narrative data. Of the used modeling techniques, the eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model shows better perfor-mance, with accuracy ranging from 0.70 to 24% for the training data and from 0.30% to 16% for the test data.

AB  - This study presents a hybrid learning model that integrates MobileNetV2 and Vision Transformer (ViT) with a stacking model to classify maize leaf diseases, addressing the critical need for early detection to improve agricultural productivity and sustainability. Utilising the 'Corn or Maize Leaf Disease Dataset' from Kaggle, comprising 4,062 high-resolution images across five classes (Common Rust, Grey Leaf Spot, Healthy, Northern Leaf Blight, Not Maize Leaf), the model achieves an impressive accuracy of 96.73%. Transfer learning from ImageNet, coupled with data augmentation (rotation, flipping, scaling, brightness adjustment), enhances generalisation, while a 20% dropout rate mitigates overfitting. The key advantage of the hybrid model lies in its ability to combine the strengths of MobileNetV2's localised feature extraction and ViT's global context understanding, enhanced by the stacking model's ability to reduce the weaknesses of either model. Explainable AI techniques, including SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), and Grad-CAM, provide transparent insights into model decisions, fostering trust among agricultural stakeholders. Comparative analysis demonstrates the model's superiority over prior works, with F1-scores ranging from 0.9276 to 1.0000. Despite minor misclassifications due to visual similarities, the model offers a robust, interpretable solution for precision agriculture.

AB  - As a crucial ecological barrier in China, the Greater Khingan Mountains play a vital role in global ecological security. Investigating the spatiotemporal variations in fractional vegetation cover (FVC) and the driving mechanisms behind its spatial differentiation is essential. This study introduced a KNDVI-XGeoML framework integrating the Kernel NDVI and explainable geospatial machine learning to analyze the FVC dynamics and the mechanisms driving their spatial differentiation in China's Greater Khingan Mountains, based on which targeted ecological management strategies were proposed. The key findings reveal that (1) from 2001 to 2022, FVC showed an increasing trend, confirming the effectiveness of ecological restoration. (2) The XGeoML model successfully revealed nonlinear relationships and threshold effects between driving factors and FVC. In addition, both single-factor importance and inter-factor interaction analyses consistently showed that landform factors dominated the spatial distribution of FVC. (3) Regional heterogeneity emerged-human activities drove the northern alpine zones, while landform factors governed other areas. (4) The natural-environment-dominated zones and human-activity-dominated zones were established, and management strategies were proposed: restricting tourism in low-altitude zones, optimizing the cold-resistant vegetation at high elevations, and improving the southern soil conditions to support ecological barrier construction. The innovation lies in merging nonlinear vegetation indices with interpretable machine learning, overcoming the traditional limitations in terms of saturation effects and analyses of spatial heterogeneity. This approach enhances our understanding of high-latitude vegetation dynamics, offering a methodological advancement for precision ecological management. The spatial zoning strategy based on dominant drivers provides actionable insights for maintaining this critical ecological barrier, particularly under climate change pressures. The framework demonstrates strong potential for extrapolation to other ecologically sensitive regions requiring data-driven conservation planning.

KW  - Crop recommendation system
KW  - Deep learning
KW  - Bayesian optimization
KW  - Soil suitability analysis
AB  - The main reason for agricultural productivity decline is farmers' failure to choose the appropriate crop for their soil. It is important for farmers to understand which crops are suitable for different soil types based on their characteristics. Due to the vast variety of soil types worldwide, farmers often struggle to choose the most profitable crop for their land. To improve crop yields, a crop selection system has been developed using GBRTbased deep learning surrogate models. Gradient Boosted Regression Tree (GBRT) has been combined with a Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm to determine the most optimal hyperparameters for the deep neural network. The optimized hyperparameters are then applied during the testing phase. Further, the impact of each input parameter on the individual outputs is evaluated using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). The crop recommendation system comprises data preparation, classification, and performance evaluation modules. A classification method based on confusion matrices and performance matrices, as well as feature analysis using density plots and correlation plots, follows. The crop selection system categorizes the experimental dataset into 12 classes, with three for each of the four crops. The dataset includes soil-specific physical and chemical features such as sand, silt, clay, pH, electric conductivity (EC), soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). The developed surrogate model is highly accurate, precise, and reliable, with an F1-Score of 1.0 for all classes in the dataset, indicating exact accuracy and recall. The DNN-based classification model achieves an average classification accuracy of 1.00.

AB  - Simplicial map neural networks (SMNNs) are topology-based neural networks with interesting properties such as universal approximation ability and robustness to adversarial examples under appropriate conditions. However, SMNNs present some bottlenecks for their possible application in high-dimensional datasets. First, SMNNs have precomputed fixed weight and no SMNN training process has been defined so far, so they lack generalization ability. Second, SMNNs require the construction of a convex polytope surrounding the input dataset. In this paper, we overcome these issues by proposing an SMNN training procedure based on a support subset of the given dataset and replacing the construction of the convex polytope by a method based on projections to a hypersphere. In addition, the explainability capacity of SMNNs and effective implementation are also newly introduced in this paper.

AB  - Feature construction can contribute to comprehensibility and performance of machine learning models. Unfor-tunately, it usually requires exhaustive search in the attribute space or time-consuming human involvement to generate meaningful features. We propose a novel heuristic approach for reducing the search space based on aggregation of instance-based explanations of predictive models. The proposed Explainable Feature Construction (EFC) methodology identifies groups of co-occurring attributes exposed by popular explanation methods, such as IME and SHAP. We empirically show that reducing the search to these groups significantly reduces the time of feature construction using logical, relational, Cartesian, numerical, and threshold (num-of-N and X-of-N) constructive operators. An analysis on 10 transparent synthetic datasets shows that EFC effectively identifies informative groups of attributes and constructs relevant features. Using 30 real-world classification datasets, we show significant improvements in classification accuracy for several classifiers and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed feature construction even for large datasets. Finally, EFC generated interpretable features on a real-world problem from the financial industry, which were confirmed by a domain expert.

AB  - In today's highly competitive industrial environment, digital transformation and smart manufacturing have become crucial strategies for enhancing competitiveness. Companies undergoing digital transformation often face challenges like high initial investment, hardware-software integration difficulties, and debugging issues due to low interpretability in deep learning implementation. Therefore, this study focuses on the integration of explainable AI models and depth cameras in the footwear industry to achieve model explainability and automation of production line processes in an economic manner. By combining YOLOv7 and Mask R-CNN, a real-time object detection system is achieved to provide accurate object coordinates and tilt angles. The integration with depth cameras enables the robotic arm to grasp objects accurately in a cluttered environment. The proposed model exhibits a high accuracy rate of 97% in a simulated scenario of stacking insole pads. This technology brings significant advantages, including reducing hardware equipment investment by 20%, streamlining production processes, reducing labor costs, and enhancing overall productivity. Moreover, the model's explainability aids in system troubleshooting and errors reduction caused during digital transformation. By leveraging this integrated approach, businesses in the footwear industry can upgrade their production processes, reduce costs, and improve competitiveness in the market.

AB  - Research methods for mitigating urban heat islands (UHIs) have been widely documented. Nevertheless, the importance of mitigating UHIs through landscape allocation in urban-rural transition zones (URTZs) has rarely been emphasized in the context of intra-urban land scarcity and urban expansion in China. This study aimed to quantify the binary relationship between URTZ's landscape configuration and urban heat island intensity (UHII) by using an interpretable ensemble learning framework in Harbin, a megacity in China. After URTZ's identification, this study integrated Boruta algorithm, SHAP, ALE (interpretable machine learning techniques) and 7 tree-based machine learning models to assess the importance of URTZ's landscape configuration with both global and local angles. The results indicated that: construction land contributed most, with construction land ratio (23.20 %), separation degree (15.95 %), and maximum patch index (15.03 %) ranking highest. This was followed by agricultural land landscape shape index (10.31 %) and landscape diversity (9 %). Maintaining construction land ratio at 50-70 % can keep UHII unchanged; UHII at the grid landscape level can be alleviated when separation degree between construction land patches was above 0.7. The largest construction land patch within the grid was maintained at 20-40 or 50-70, which will not bring significant changes to UHII. The agricultural land landscape shape should be as simple as possible to reduce UHII; landscape diversity greater than 0.6 can reduce UHII, and <0.6 can increase UHII. These findings provide valuable insights into UHI mitigation and offer strategic guidance for ecological planning to promote sustainable development of large cities in rapidly changing URTZs.

AB  - Credit risk management is an area where regulators expect banks to have transparent and auditable risk models, which would preclude the use of more accurate black-box models. Furthermore, the opaque-ness of these models may hide unknown biases that may lead to unfair lending decisions. In this study, we show that banks do not have to sacrifice prediction accuracy at the cost of model transparency to be compliant with regulatory requirements. We illustrate this by showing that the predictions of credit losses given by a black-box model can be easily explained in terms of their inputs. Because black-box models are better at uncovering complex patterns in the data, banks should consider the determinants of credit losses suggested by these models in lending decisions and pricing of credit exposures.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The increasing complexity and dynamism of modern digital infrastructures have significantly elevated the difficulty of anticipating and mitigating cyber threats. Traditional risk assessment methods, often based on static rules and signature matching, fail to provide sufficient predictive capabilities in scenarios characterized by high-volume, heterogeneous data and evolving attack patterns. Furthermore, conventional machine learning models lack architectural flexibility and contextual awareness to detect stealthy or multi-stage attacks across distributed environments. This paper proposes a hybrid model for predictive cyber risk assessment that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for relational pattern modeling, a Transformer-based language model (CyberBERT) for semantic representation of logs and traffic data, and a Federated Learning framework to preserve data privacy during training. The model was trained and evaluated using public datasets (CIC-IDS2017, UNSW-NB15, MITRE ATT&CK, TON_IoT) and synthetically generated traffic from honeypots and real anonymized networks. The system achieved an average F1-score of 0.947, significantly outperforming traditional classifiers such as SVM (0.836), Random Forest (0.873), and standard deep neural networks (0.901). Including adversarial training improved attack detection by 21.3 % under evasion scenarios. Furthermore, the model supports interpretability through SHAP and LIME, reaching an 83.5 % concordance in explanation consistency. The architecture demonstrates scalability and low-latency inference on edge and cloud platforms, making it suitable for real-time deployment in heterogeneous environments. These results highlight the model's capability to deliver accurate, resilient, and privacy-preserving predictions of cyber risks across dynamic and distributed infrastructures.

AB  - Floods are among the most common and destructive natural hazards, particularly in areas characterized by data scarcity and intricate geomorphological features. In such regions, accurate and interpretable flood susceptibility mapping is essential for effective risk reduction and informed urban planning. This study proposes a novel ensemble machine learning (ML) framework integrated with geomorphology-based flood conditioning factors (FCFs) to identify flood-prone areas over Kosi Megafan in India-a large watershed with significant anabranching characteristics. A comprehensive set of 21 FCFs, including topographic, hydrologic, and stream-related indicators-was derived from the FABDEM, satellite imagery, and ancillary datasets. After multicollinearity analysis and information gain ratio filtering, 15 key FCFs were selected for model training. Four base ML models, namely, Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and Long Short-Term Memory, were optimized using Bayesian techniques and combined into a stacked ensemble classifier. The model was trained using historical flood extents from the Global Surface Water dataset and validated against Sentinel-1 SAR imagery. Results indicate that the ensemble model outperformed individual classifiers, achieving the highest accuracy (90 %) and Cohen's Kappa (0.79). SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were used to enhance interpretability, highlighting elevation, rainfall, curve number, and drainage density as the most influential predictors. The final flood susceptibility map shows that 35.18 % of the megafan is very highly susceptible, aligning well with observed flood events. This interpretable and scalable framework holds strong potential for enhancing flood risk management in complex, datascarce catchments, while also supporting global initiatives such as the Sendai Framework and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 11 and 13.

AB  - Photosynthetic bacteria (PSB) excel in wastewater treatment by removing pollutants and generating biomass but are challenging to optimize due to complex operational and environmental interactions. Neural Ordinary Differential Equations, Elastic Net, Stacking, and Categorical Boosting were applied as artificial intelligence methods to predict chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency, biomass productivity, biomass yield, and energy yield. Among these, the Stacking model demonstrated superior predictive performance across all targets. Interpretable machine learning methods were employed to identify key features and establish their workable ranges, which included dissolved oxygen (0.3-2.8 mg L-1), illuminance (2995.3-6000.0 lux), and light energy (20.0-40.0 kWh) for COD removal efficiency; organic loading rate (OLR, 5.7-7.5 g COD L-1 d(-1)), hydraulic retention time (HRT, 0.2-3.2 d), and COD concentration (5.3-10.1 g L-1) for biomass productivity; COD/N ratio (609.0-800.0), OLR (0.1-2.4 g COD L-1 d(-1)), and illuminance (2661-6000 lux) for biomass yield; and pH (6.5-7.9) and HRT (1.2-2.6 d) for energy yield. The two-dimensional partial dependence plots revealed that optimal interactions between two key input features resulted in COD removal efficiency >72%, biomass productivity >28 g L(-1 )d(-1), biomass yield> 0.96 g COD(biomass )g CODremoved-1, energy yield> 0.49 g kWh(-1). This work advances the understanding of PSB optimization in wastewater treatment through a combination of advanced machine learning and interpretability analysis, offering potential for more efficient resource recovery and process optimization.

AB  - The science of data mining has contributed considerably to the education sector. However, most educational data mining (EDM) studies have focused on predicting the future performance of students and detecting at-risk students to provide early targeted interventions. A few studies used machine learning techniques to predict the future academic pathways for degree students. However, there are limited studies that use the datasets of high school students to predict future pathways. Moreover, such studies are yet to be conducted using datasets produced in Saudi high schools. Therefore, researchers that work in the education sector have focused on EDM and are eager to apply advanced computer science methods to upgrade old administrative systems. Furthermore, the education sector is a rich field with data that can be exploited to improve and enhance educational management systems and accelerate digital transformation. In this study, we explore the applications of EDM and review the algorithms used by other researchers in this field. We applied supervised machine learning classifiers to educational datasets collected from high schools in Saudi to predict the future academic pathways of students and identify the essential factors that affect them. This study contributes to the literature by developing a predictive model for students in Saudi high schools and detecting critical features that affect future academic careers of the students. Furthermore, we used explainable artificial intelligence to interpret the best model and enhance its transparency.

AB  - Evaluating social vulnerability and identifying at-risk populations are foundational to hazard risk mitigation and sustainable human settlement, yet these tasks entail distinct challenges that vary across urban-rural contexts and temporal scales. Despite Australia's escalating exposure to natural disasters, longitudinal, nationwide metrics of social vulnerability remain absent, with prior research constrained to localized or temporally fragmented analyses. Grounded in Cutter's social vulnerability framework, this study develops fine-grained, longitudinal indices of social vulnerability for urban and rural Australia across five census cycles (2001-2021). Spatial inequities, temporal trends, and associations between social vulnerability and 30 built environment indicators were analyzed using interpretable machine learning techniques. Key findings reveal that while the geographic distribution of the most vulnerable areas has remained stable over time, socioeconomic inequities of such areas have diminished whereas spatial clustering intensified. Resilient regions are characterized by enhanced access to public amenities, housing diversity, and commercial density-factors that collectively attenuate vulnerability. Furthermore, upgraded built environments attract socioeconomically advantaged populations, amplifying aggregated resilience. To our knowledge, this represents the first comprehensive, longitudinal, and spatially explicit national assessment of social vulnerability in Australia over two decades. The results elucidate critical trends in vulnerability and their interplay with built environment dynamics, offering actionable insights for place-based hazard mitigation, urban-rural sustainability, and infrastructure resilience. By bridging data gaps, this work addresses Australia's pressing need for evidence-driven policy and spatially targeted interventions to counter intensifying natural hazards and prioritize the resilience of human settlement.

AB  - Despite the steady decline in the total number of pedestrian crashes in Korea, the pedestrian fatality rate per 100,000 people remains high compared to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) average. As the data of traffic crashes is gradually accumulated every year, various machine learning methodologies are needed to analyze this data. This study proposed a new algorithmic approach using Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanation (LIME) to identify vulnerable pedestrian crash areas based on each determinant influencing these severity in Seoul. Using the pedestrian crash data from 2016 to 2018, this study uses the XGBoost to model the determinants of pedestrian crash severity and LIME to predict high-risk areas for each determinant. A new algorithmic approach using LIME was proposed to enhance the reliability by filtering data based on an Explanation Fit (R2 >= 0.26), in reference to Cohen (1988). Upon synthesizing the results, Cheongnyangni Station and Gangnam Station in Seoul were predicted as vulnerable to severe pedestrian crashes due to the superposition of influencing variables considered in this study. In this study, the heatmap predictions derived from the proposed algorithm methodology provided insights into the vulnerable areas and non-linear determinants of pedestrian crash severity. Additionally, this study suggests policy implications aimed at reducing pedestrian crash severity and enhancing pedestrian safety.

AB  - Floods cause average annual losses of more than US$30 billion in the US and are estimated to significantly increase due to global change. Flood resilience, which currently differs strongly between socio-economic groups, needs to be substantially improved by proactive adaptive measures, such as timely purchase of flood insurance. Yet, knowledge about the state and uptake of private adaptation and its drivers is so far scarce and fragmented. Based on interpretable machine learning and large insurance and socio-economic open data sets covering the whole continental US we reveal that flood insurance purchase is characterized by reactive behavior after severe flood events. However, we observe that the Community Rating System helps overcome this behavior by effectively fostering proactive insurance purchase, irrespective of socio-economic backgrounds in the communities. Thus, we recommend developing additional targeted measures to help overcome existing inequalities, for example, by providing special incentives to the most vulnerable and exposed communities.
   Flood resilience of individuals and communities can be improved by bottom-up strategies, such as insurance purchase, or top-down measures like the US National Flood Insurance Program's Community Rating System (CRS). Our interpretable machine learning approach shows that flood insurances are mostly purchased reactively, after the occurrence of a flood event. Yet, reactive behaviors are ill-suited as more extreme events are expected under future climate, also in areas that were not previously flooded. The CRS counteracts this behavior by fostering proactive adaptation across a widespread range of socio-economic backgrounds. Future risk management including the CRS should support and motivate individuals' proactive adaptation with a particular focus on highly vulnerable social groups to overcome existing inequalities in flood risk.
   Flood insurance purchase in the US is dominated by reactive behavior after severe floodsThe Community Rating System (CRS) fosters proactive insurance adoption irrespective of socio-economic backgroundThe CRS should further balance existing inequalities by targeting specific population segments

AB  - This study investigates the relationship between the built environment and walking behavior for socially resilient urban design to promote walking in the aging population. We used a total of 117,259 GPS points and 160 personday data points for elderly individuals living in Uijeongbu-si, Gyeonggi-do, Korea. The differences in the walking environments selected based on the walking purpose were analyzed using a random forest method, and the nonlinear relationship was investigated. In addition, an in-depth analysis was performed by adopting an interpretation approach from global and local perspectives. The findings highlight the significance of walking street pleasure and network properties for leisure walking. Specifically, a green area ratio of 15 % or more positively relationship path choice for leisure, underscoring the importance of sufficient green space. Conversely, the high proportion of green areas typically has negative implications for commercial walking. Road connectivity and integration are predominantly negatively associated with route choice for leisure, indicating a decreased preference for highly integrated roads during leisure walking activities. These findings provide valuable insights for an evidence-based urban design strategy to make walkable environments. It can contribute to urban planning and policy, particularly the development of tailored walkable environments for the older population.

AB  - Urban greening plays a crucial role in maintaining environmental sustainability and enhancing people's well-being. However, limited by the shortcomings of traditional methods, studying the heterogeneity and nonlinearity between environmental factors and green view index (GVI) still faces many challenges. To address the concerns of nonlinearity, spatial heterogeneity, and interpretability, an interpretable spatial machine learning framework incorporating the Geographically Weighted Random Forest (GWRF) model and the SHapley Additive exPlanation (Shap) model is proposed in this paper. In this paper, we combine multi-source big data, such as Baidu Street View data and remote sensing images, and utilize semantic segmentation models and geographic data processing techniques to study the global and local interpretation of the Beijing region with GVI as the key indicator. Our research results show that: (1) Within the Sixth Ring Road of Beijing, GVI shows significant spatial clustering phenomenon and positive correlation linkage, and at the same time exhibits significant spatial differences; (2) Among many environmental variables, the increase of green coverage rate has the most significant positive effect on GVI, while the increase of building density shows a strong negative correlation with GVI; (3) The performance of the GWRF model in predicting GVI is excellent and far exceeds that of comparison models.; (4) Whether it is the green coverage rate, urban built environment or socioeconomic factors, their influence on GVI shows non-linear characteristics and a certain threshold effect. With the help of these non-linear influences and explicit threshold effects, quantitative analyses of greening are provided, which can help to assist urban planners in making more scientific and rational decisions when allocating greening resources.

By identifying CEs from residential land through building electricity consumption, 14 built environment indicators, including land area (LA), floor area ratio (FAR), greening ratio (GA), building density (BD), gross floor area (GFA), land use mix rate (Phh), and permanent population density (PPD), were selected to establish an interpretable machine learning (ML) model based on the XGBoost-SHAP attribution analysis framework. The research results show that, first, the goodness of fit of the XGBoost model reached 91.9%, and its prediction accuracy was better than that of gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), random forest (RF), the Adaboost model, and the traditional logistic model. Second, compared with other ML models, the XGBoost-SHAP model explained the influencing factors of CEs from residential land more clearly. The SHAP attribution analysis results indicate that BD, FAR, and Phh were the most important factors affecting CEs. Third, there was a significant nonlinear relationship and threshold effect between built environment characteristic variables and CEs from residential land. Fourth, there was an interaction between different dimensions of environmental factors, and BD, FAR, and Phh played a dominant role in the interaction. Reducing FAR is considered to be an effective CE reduction strategy. This research provides practical suggestions for urban planners on reducing CEs from residential land, which has important policy implications and practical significance.

AB  - In pursuing sustainable transport, understanding the dynamics of transit passengers' travel demand is necessary for establishing more attractive public transport relative to cars. However, to what extent daily transit use displays geographic and temporal variabilities or predictability, and identifying what are the contributing factors explaining these patterns have not been fully addressed. Drawing on smart card data in Beijing, China, this study adopts new indices to capture the spatial and temporal variability of bus use during peak hours and investigates their associations with relevant contextual features. Using explainable machine learning, our findings reveal nonlinearities and threshold points in the spatial and temporal variability of bus trips as a function of trip frequency. Greater distance to the urban centres (>10 km) is associated with increased spatial variability of bus use, while greater separation of trip origins and destinations from the subcentres reduces both spatial and temporal variability reflecting highly predictable of trips. Higher availability of bus routes is linked to higher spatial variability but lower temporal variability. Meanwhile, both lower and higher road density is associated with higher spatial variability of bus use especially in morning times. These findings indicate that different built environment features moderate the flexibility of choosing travel time and locations influencing the predictability of trips. Understanding highly predictable trips is key to develop more effective planning and operation of public transport.

AB  - In the pursuit of sustainable urban development, construction land development (CLD) not only carries the important mission of promoting economic growth but also needs to actively respond to the environmental requirements of reducing carbon emissions. However, there is a tension and balance between these two objectives. This study explores the evolution characteristics and influencing mechanisms of the synergistic relationship between carbon emission efficiency and economic benefits of CLD based on the undesirable slacks-based measurement, coupling coordination degree (CCD) model, Tapio decoupling model, spatial convergence model, and interpretable machine learning techniques. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) The CCR between CEE and economic benefits of CLD in China shows the characteristic of "improvement-stability-local decline", and it is higher in the eastern region than in the central and western regions. (2) The decoupling of carbon emission efficiency (CEE) and economic benefits of CLD between 2003 and 2023 shows diverse trends in different provinces and time scales in China. (3) China's eastern region are consistent with sigma-convergence and beta-convergence, and the gap in the level of inter-regional coupling co-ordination has narrowed. On the contrary, the central and western regions do not pass the sigma and beta-convergence tests, and the regional equilibrium needs to be improved. (4) In descending order of influence on CCR, they are ownership structure, urban construction land per capita, energy consumption per unit of gross domestic product, energy structure, industrial structure, and foreign trade investment intensity.

AB  - Although shared e-scooters have displayed both complementary and competitive relationships with public transport, less attention has been paid to investigating the spatiotemporal variations of such relationships, and how the relationships are associated with the urban built environment. To bridge the gaps, we first explore the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of such relationships by conducting a comparative study of Stockholm and Helsinki based on the empirical data. Then, an explainable AI method is applied to examine the associations between the relationships and built environment. We found that Helsinki presents higher ratios of the competitive dominant areas (DPET) compared with Stockholm showing higher ratios of the complementary dominant areas (DPLE). The correlation analysis results indicate that the distance-to-public-transport is associated with DPET in two cities. Some factors present a non-linear effect, e.g., the density-of-the population, etc. This study is beneficial for the better integration of shared e-scooters and public transport towards sustainable urban mobility systems.

AB  - Regional extreme climate change remains a major environmental issue of global concern. However, in the context of the joint effects of urban expansion and the urban ecological environment, the responses of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to regional climate change and its driving mechanism remain unclear. This study takes Chengdu as an example, selects the air temperature (Ta), precipitation (P), wind speed (WS), and soil water content (SWC) within the period from 2001 to 2023 as influencing factors, and uses Theil-Sen median trend analysis and interpretable machine learning models (random forest (RF), BP neural network, support vector machine (SVM), and extreme gradient boosting (XG-Boost) models). The average absolute value of Shapley additive explanations (SHAPs) is adopted as an indicator to explore the key mechanism driving regional climate change in Chengdu in terms of NDVI changes. The analysis results reveal that the NDVI exhibited an extremely significant increasing trend during the study period (p = 8.6 x 10(-6) < 0.001), and that precipitation showed a significant increasing trend (p = 1.2 x 10(-4) < 0.001); however, the air temperature, wind speed, and soil-relative volumetric water content all showed insignificant increasing trends. A simulation of interpretable machine learning models revealed that the random forest (RF) model performed exceptionally well in terms of simulating the dynamics of the urban NDVI (R-2 = 0.746), indicating that the RF model has an excellent ability to capture the complex ecological interactions of a city without prior assumptions. The dependence relationship between the simulation results and the main driving factors indicates that the Ta and P are the main factors affecting the NDVI changes. In contrast, the SWC and WS had relatively small influences on the NDVI changes. The prediction analysis results reveal that a monthly average temperature of 25 degrees C and a monthly average precipitation of approximately 130 mm are conducive to the stability of the NDVI in the study area. This study provides a reference for exploring the responses of NDVI changes to regional climate change in the context of urban expansion and urban ecological construction.

AB  - This study aims to develop and evaluate a natural gradient boosting (NGBoost) model optimized with Optuna for estimating ground settlement during tunnel excavation, incorporating Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) to perform interpretability analysis on the model's estimation results. The model's predictive performance was comprehensively assessed using datasets from two earth pressure balance shield tunneling projects in Changsha and Zhengzhou, China. Comparative analyses demonstrated the superior accuracy and generalization capability of the Optuna-NGBoost-SHAP model (training set: R2 = 0.9984, MAE = 0.1004, RMSE = 0.4193, MedAE = 0.0122; validation set: R2 = 0.9001, MAE = 1.3363, RMSE = 3.2992, MedAE = 0.3042; test set: R2 = 0.9361, MAE = 0.9961, RMSE = 2.5388, MedAE = 0.2147). SHAP value analysis quantitatively evaluated the contributions of input features to the model's estimations, identifying geometric factors (distance from the shield machine to the monitoring section and cover depth) as the most important features. The findings provide robust decision support for safety management during tunnel construction and demonstrate the reliability and efficiency of the Optuna-NGBoost-SHAP framework in estimating complex ground settlement scenarios.

AB  - Steel bridges are widely used in bridge engineering. In the structural design of steel bridge deck pavement systems, engineers focus on obtaining mechanical properties by calculating design parameters and are keen to establish a quick and accurate solution method. Because of the complex knowledge system involved in the numerical calculation method, it is difficult for the general engineering designer to master it. Researchers have started using artificial intelligence algorithms to solve problems in civil engineering. This study developed an XGBoost-based mechanical performance prediction model for steel bridge deck pavement systems. First, numerical simulation tests are conducted at unfavorable load locations using a finite element model to establish a dataset. Then, an XGBoost model is built using this dataset, and its parameters are optimized and compared with traditional machine learning models. Finally, an explanatory analysis of the model is performed using SHAP, an interpretable machine learning framework. The results indicate that the developed XGBoost model accurately predicts the mechanical properties of steel bridge deck pavement systems.

AB  - Data-driven models using machine learning have been widely used in remote-sensing applications such as the retrieval of biophysical variables and land cover classification. However, these models behave as a 'black box', meaning that the relationships between the input and predicted variables are hard to interpret. Recent regression models that downscale sun-induced fluorescence (SIF) with MODIS and weather variables are an example. The impact of weather variables on the predicted SIF in these models is unknown. The explanation of such weather-SIF relationships would aid in the understanding of climate-related constraints on photosynthesis phenology since SIF is a proxy of gross primary productivity. Here, we used SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) - a novel technique based on game theory - for explaining the contribution of input variables to the individual predictions in a machine learning model. We explored the capabilities of this technique with a weather-SIF model. The regression model predicted ESA-TROPOSIF measurements from ERA5-Land air temperature, shortwave radiation, and vapour-pressure-deficit (VPD) data. The SHAP values of the model were estimated at the start and end of the growing season for the entire globe. These values depicted the global constraints of the three climate variables on the photosynthetically active season and confirmed existing knowledge on the limiting factors of terrestrial photosynthesis with unprecedented spatial detail. Radiation was the limiting factor in tropical rainforest and VPD constrained the start and end of the growing season in tropical dryland ecosystems. In extra-tropical regions, temperature was the main limiting factor during the start of the growing season, but both temperature and radiation constrained photosynthesis at the end of the growing season. This technique may help future remote sensing studies that require the use of non-interpretable machine-learning regression models and explain how input variables contribute to the model prediction in a spatiotemporally explicit manner.

AB  - Terrestrial ecosystems are increasingly threatened by more frequent and intensified compound dry -heat conditions, exacerbated by land -atmosphere feedback under changing climate. The water -use strategy (WUS), which determines the trade-off between carbon assimilation and water consumption, is a key metric for exploring how terrestrial ecosystems respond to environmental stresses. However, how water availability influences their wateruse strategies in response to dry -heat conditions is still not well understood. Here, we compared the response of WUS to dry -heat conditions in two poplar plantations with different soil water availability (SWA) in North China, represented by the Priestley -Taylor coefficient ( alpha), and applied an interpretable machine learning algorithm to disentangle the independent and interactive effects of the main biophysical factors on WUS under dry, heat, and their compound conditions. We found that the plantation with higher SWA (high-SWA plantation) showed a more permissive WUS (i.e., increased marginal water cost of carbon gain) under dry -heat conditions than the low-SWA one due to the decoupling of evapotranspiration and gross primary productivity, and less sensitive to alpha and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) variations. During dry conditions, heat made the WUS more permissive in the high-SWA plantation and more conservative in the low-SWA one. Moreover, the alpha-VPD interaction was progressively strengthened as intensified dry -heat stresses until reaching a threshold ( alpha = 0.7, VPD = 2.2 kPa in the low-SWA plantation and alpha = 0.85, VPD = 2.6 kPa in the high-SWA plantation). Thus, our study emphasizes that land -atmosphere feedback exacerbates the vulnerability of poplar plantations to dry -heat conditions.

AB  - Accurate prediction of crown convergence in Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) tunnels is critical for ensuring construction safety, optimizing support design, and improving construction efficiency. This study proposes an interpretable machine learning method based on Bayesian optimization (BO) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for predicting crown convergence (CC) in TBM tunnels. Firstly, a dataset comprising 1,501 samples was constructed using tunnel engineering data. Then, six classical ML models, namely, Support Vector Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and K-nearest neighbors-were developed, and BO was applied to tune the hyperparameters of each model to achieve accurate prediction of CC. Subsequently, the SHAP method was adopted to interpret the LightGBM model, quantifying the contribution of each input feature to the model's predictions. The results indicate that the LightGBM model achieved the best prediction performance on the test set, with root mean squared error, mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, and determination coefficient values of 0.9122 mm, 0.6027 mm, 0.0644, and 0.9636, respectively; the average SHAP values for the six input features of the LightGBM model were ranked as follows: Time (0.1366) > Rock grade (0.0871) > Depth ratio (0.0528) > Still arch (0.0200) > Saturated compressive strength (0.0093) > Rock quality designation (0.0047). Validation using data from a TBM water conveyance tunnel in Xinjiang, China, confirmed the method's practical utility, positioning it as an effective auxiliary tool for safer and more efficient TBM tunnel construction.

AB  - Background: This study developed an explainable machine learning model for baseline internal mammary lymph node metastasis (IMNM) in breast cancer patients. Materials and methods: This study included three cohorts: a derivation cohort (n = 1997) from Peking University Cancer Hospital, a temporal testing cohort (n = 633) from the same center, and a SEER cohort (n = 51,420). Multiple machine learning strategies were conducted: Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Boruta, backward stepwise regression, and best subset for feature selection, and logistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) for model construction. The best-performing model was validated across internal and temporal testing cohorts. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis was conducted to improve interpretability. Results: Six clinical features (clinical N stage, size, stage, classification, grade and location) were used to construct the final predictive model with SVM. The model achieved robust performance, with AUCs of 0<middle dot>811 (0<middle dot>790-0<middle dot>843), 0.806 (0<middle dot>760-0<middle dot>857) and 0<middle dot>864 (0<middle dot>830-0<middle dot>926) in the training, internal testing and temporal testing cohort, respectively. High-risk patients exhibited significantly worse outcomes with DFS (HR 2<middle dot>776, 95 % CI: 1<middle dot>897-4<middle dot>064, p < 0<middle dot>001) and OS (HR of 1<middle dot>962, 95 % CI: 1<middle dot>853-2<middle dot>077, p < 0<middle dot>001). An online prediction tool was established that allows users to input key clinical variables and obtain model-predicted probabilities along with SHAP-based explanations. Conclusion: This validated and explainable machine learning model offers a practical tool for early risk stratification, aiding clinicians in appropriate baseline imaging selection and adjuvant treatment planning.

AB  - Urban safety constitutes a foundational pillar for sustainable cities. This study aims to analyze the relationship between various crime types and urban environmental characteristics in the case of Daegu Metropolitan City, South Korea, and to develop a predictive crime risk map. Spatial data were constructed by generating buffer zones ranging from 10 to 50 m around 112 emergency call locations. Utilizing the XGBoost algorithm in conjunction with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), we identified key variables influencing different types of crime. The analysis revealed that commercial facilities, floating population, credit card transaction volumes, number of households, and road area were consistently significant predictors across all crime categories, with the highest predictive performance observed at the 10-meter buffer scale. Based on the prediction results, we developed high-resolution crime probability maps that visualize high-risk areas and assessed the adequacy of existing CCTV installations. By providing interpretable, spatially detailed, and high-resolution forecasts, this research enables data-driven crime prevention strategies and supports sustainable urban planning and inclusive safety policies. The proposed approach is inherently scalable and transferable to a variety of urban contexts that encounter difficulties in synchronizing safety infrastructure with rapidly evolving urban dynamics.

AB  - Analysis of transport mode choice is crucial in transportation planning and optimization. Traditionally, the transport mode of individuals is detected by discrete choice models (DCMs), which rely on data regarding individual and household attributes. Using these attribute data raises privacy concerns and limits the applicability of the model. Meanwhile, the detection results of DCMs may be biased, despite providing insight into the impact of variables. The machine learning models are more effective for mode detection, but most models need more interpretability. In this study, an interpretable machine learning model is developed to detect the transport modes of individuals. The mobility features of individuals, which introduce the velocity and acceleration of the center of mass (COM) are innovatively considered in the detection model. These mobility features are combined with multi -source data, including land use mix, GDP, population and online map service data as detection features. Using the travel survey data from Nanjing, China in 2015, the effects of different machine learning models on fine-grained detection performance are investigated. The results indicate that the deep forest model presents the best detection performance and achieves an accuracy of 0.82 in the test dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed detection model. Furthermore, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and ablation experiments are conducted to overcome the non -interpretability issue of the machine learning models. The results show that the mobility features of individuals are the most critical features for improving detection performance. This study is essential for improving the structure of transport modes and maintaining low-carbon and sustainable development in urban traffic systems.

AB  - This study used a pedestrian-involved near-crash database and adopted an interpretable machine learning framework using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to understand the factors associated with critical pedestrian-involved near-crash events. The results indicate that pedestrians with a relatively higher walking speed are more likely to be involved in critical near-crash events. Furthermore, critical pedestrian-involved near-crash events are highly associated with vehicles with driving speeds of less than 10 mph. A higher pedestrian volume is highly associated with critical near-crash events with left-turn vehicles. It is possible that a higher pedestrian volume increases the occurrence of jaywalking behavior or encourages more pedestrians to step into the crosswalk when they should not. By contrast, a higher pedestrian volume is highly associated with non-critical near-crash events with right-turn vehicles. Right-turn vehicles often expect that there will be pedestrians crossing, and a higher volume of pedestrian traffic increases a driver's awareness and caution while turning. The study also found that a longer signal cycle is highly associated with critical near-crash events when the pedestrian volume is low, while a relatively short signal cycle length is highly associated with critical near-crash events when the pedestrian volume is high. During non-peak hours, pedestrians have less tolerance for a relatively longer signal cycle. Moreover, a relatively shorter signal cycle length at peak hours will limit the number of pedestrians that can cross during a cycle and encourage the possibility of pedestrians jaywalking or stepping onto the crosswalk when they should not.

AB  - Retaining walls are utilized to support the earth and prevent the soil from spreading with natural slope angles where there are differences in the elevation of ground surfaces. As the need for retaining structures increases, the use of retaining walls is increasing. The retaining walls, which increase the stability of levels, are economical and meet existing adverse conditions. A considerable amount of retaining walls is made from steel-reinforced concrete. The construction of reinforced concrete retaining walls can be costly due to its components. For this reason, the optimum cost should be targeted in the design of retaining walls. This study presents an artificial neural network (ANN) model developed to predict the optimum dimensions of a retaining wall using soil properties, material properties, and external loading conditions. The dataset utilized to train the ANN model is generated with the Flower Pollination Algorithm. The target variables in the dataset are the length of the heel (y(1)), length of the toe (y(2)), thickness of the stem (top) (y(3)), thickness of the stem (bottom) (y(4)), foundation base thickness (y(5)) and cost (y(6)) and these are estimated by utilizing an ANN model based on the height of the wall (x(1)), material unit weight (x(2)), wall friction angle (x(3)), surcharge load (x(4)), concrete cost per m(3) (x(5)), steel cost per ton (x(6)) and the soil class (x(7)). The model is formulated and trained as a multi-output regression model, as all outputs are numeric and continuous. The training and evaluation of the model results in a high prediction performance (R-2 > 0.99). In addition, the impacts of different input features on the model predictions are revealed using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm. The study demonstrates that when trained with a large dataset, ANN models perform very well by predicting the optimal cost with high performance.

AB  - Land degradation due to mismanagement is widespread globally and may threaten the achievement of several UN Sustainable Development Goals. Yet the differences in land productivity degradation under various land management patterns (land sparing vs. land sharing) are poorly known. In this research, we used remote sensing data to develop a machine learning model for assessing the risk of land productivity degradation and interpreted the model using state-of-the-art interpretable artificial intelligence techniques. In 2018, the risk level of land productivity degradation in the agricultural production space of the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration (YRD) was 0.230. More than half of the area was at low risk (68.19% of the area), mainly in mountainous and hilly areas. The degradation risk of the land sharing management pattern is lower than that of the land sparing pattern, but there are significant differences among provinces/municipalities. The four most influential factors for land productivity degradation in YRD were Normalized Vegetation Difference Index, nighttime light, elevation, and nitrogen deposition, which together explained 72.75% of the degradation risk. This study provides a methodological framework for land degradation governance in emerging urban agglomerations. It strongly recommends that policymakers explore locally appropriate land management patterns based on regional contexts.

AB  - This study introduces a novel methodology for enhancing the compressive strength of selfcompacting concrete (SCC) via the use of the Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM), a sophisticated and interpretable machine learning algorithm. It presents a data -driven model that aims to accurately predict the strength of SCC by considering the intricate interactions among its various elements. Additionally, the model provides insights into the variables that influence SCC ' s compressive strength. By using EBM in conjunction with XGBoost and CatBoost algorithms, this study conducts a comparative examination of predictive abilities using datasets related to composition and rheology. The findings reveal that CatBoost has greater predictive performance using rheology dataset, as shown by an R 2 value of 0.977. Conversely, XGBoost exhibits a higher predictive capability using the composition dataset, as indicated by an R 2 value of 0.947. The EBM can provide comprehensive explanations at both global and local levels. It effectively identifies the key factors that have a significant influence on compressive strength. These factors include the coarse aggregate content, cement content, water content, viscosity, and V -funnel flow time. The study findings provide more evidence to support the notion that including rheological data into the model leads to a notable improvement in its accuracy. This outcome further confirms the existence of a direct correlation between rheological properties and compressive strength. The explanatory insights provided by EBM give practical instructions for customising SCC mixes to attain desired strengths. This facilitates quality control and enables personalised concrete design in the field of construction. This study highlights the potential of interpretable machine learning algorithms in improving the predictive modelling of SCC features. This advancement may lead to the development of more durable, efficient, and customised building materials.

AB  - Background Adjuvant chemotherapy provides a limited survival benefit (<5%) for patients with stage II colorectal cancer (CRC) and is suggested for high-risk patients. Given the heterogeneity of stage II CRC, we aimed to develop a clinically explainable artificial intelligence (AI)-powered analyser to identify radiological phenotypes that would benefit from chemotherapy. Methods Multimodal data from patients with CRC across six cohorts were collected, including 405 patients from the Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital for model development and 153 patients from the Yunnan Provincial Cancer Centre for validation. RNA sequencing data were used to identify the differentially expressed genes in the two radiological clusters. Histopathological patterns were evaluated to bridge the gap between the imaging and genetic information. Finally, we investigated the discovered morphological patterns of mouse models to observe imaging features. Findings The survival benefit of chemotherapy varied significantly among the AI-powered radiological clusters [interaction hazard ratio (iHR) = 5.35, (95% CI: 1.98, 14.41), adjusted P-interaction = 0.012]. Distinct biological pathways related to immune and stromal cell abundance were observed between the clusters. The observation only (OO)-preferable cluster exhibited higher necrosis, haemorrhage, and tortuous vessels, whereas the adjuvant chemotherapy (AC)-preferable cluster exhibited vessels with greater pericyte coverage, allowing for a more enriched infiltration of B, CD4(+)-T, and CD8(+)-T cells into the core tumoural areas. Further experiments confirmed that changes in vessel morphology led to alterations in predictive imaging features. Interpretation The developed explainable AI-powered analyser effectively identified patients with stage II CRC with improved overall survival after receiving adjuvant chemotherapy, thereby contributing to the advancement of precision oncology.

AB  - A total of 81 lemon juices samples were detected using an optimized UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS method and colorimetric assays. Concentration of 3 organic acids (ascorbic acid, malic acid and citric acid), 3 saccharides (glucose, fructose and sucrose) and 6 phenolic acids (trans-p-coumaric acid, 3-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, caffeic acid) were quantified. Their total polyphenol, antioxidant activity and Ferric reducing antioxidant power were also measured. For the prediction of authentic and adulterated lemon juices and commercially sourced lemonade beverages based on the acquired metabolic profile, machine learning models including linear discriminant analysis, Gaussian naive Bayes, lasso-regularized logistic regression, random forest (RF) and support vector machine were developed based on training (70%)-cross-validation-testing (30%) workflow. The predicted accuracy on the testing set is 73e86% for different models. Individual conditional expectation analysis (how predicted probabilities change when the feature magnitude changes) was applied for model interpretation, which in particular revealed the close association of RF-probability prediction with nuance characteristics of the density distribution of metabolic features. Using established models, an open-source online dashboard was constructed for convenient classification prediction and interactive visualization in real practice.

AB  - A preliminary estimation of construction costs is a crucial operation of any project related to civil engineering. An accurate estimation ensures a proper management of the available funds and helps the project managers in their decision-making processes. For instance, it is common that specific subtasks of the project are delegated to private subcontractors. Through a call for tenders, each eventual subcontractor has the opportunity to propose a bid with a price for supplying the service. Because the call is generally public, a competition may arise between subcontractors. This impacts the price proposed by the competitors to get the contract. In order to select a subcontractor, the project manager needs to have an accurate idea of a reasonable price for the subtask given. A price higher than expected is undesirable, but a price significantly lower than expected may also result in poor quality of service. The project manager must also be able to explain to stakeholders why a price is suited and justify why a specific subcontractor has been selected. Providing an estimation that is both accurate and transparent is a hard problem for the project manager. A growing trend is to leverage machine learning for this estimation, but designing a model that is both accurate and explainable is still a challenge. Another difficulty is that an approach that is accurate for estimating the cost of a subtask may not be efficient for another one. Based on this context, this paper introduces a framework for estimating construction costs while tackling both challenges. It is based on six machine learning models and on Shapley additive explanations. This project was commissioned by the Ministry of Transport and Sustainable Mobility, a public agency responsible for transport infrastructure in Quebec, Canada. Experiments were carried out on real data, covering historical road construction costs of 11,646 contracts and eight subtasks from 2014 to 2021. Results show that the framework is able to surpass the accuracy of human estimations up to 31.56% while being able to adequately explain how the estimations have been obtained.

AB  - Intra-urban induced heating (IUIH) in hot desert cities exhibits distinct patterns and complex diurnal interactions with built environment features, differing significantly from those in temperate areas and remains not fully understood. Understanding how various built environment features contribute to intra-urban thermal variability is an essential first step in developing sub-diurnal targeted heat mitigation strategies. This study presents a datadriven examination of IUIH dynamics in Kuwait's desert metropolis. Near-surface air temperature observations were collected using high-resolution loop-type traverses at selected hours during a representative summer day to determine IUIH variability. The diurnal impacts of built environment features were modeled using an ensemble learning approach and interpreted with SHapley Additive exPlanations. Among several candidate machine learning regressors evaluated, Random Forest demonstrated strong predictive power (R2 = 0.954) with acceptable error (RMSE = 0.096, MAPE = 0.001) and least bias (MBE = 0.008). The study's significance lies in its assessment framework that emphasizes explainability of sub-diurnal dynamics, offering detailed insights that challenge traditional assumptions and inform both immediate local climate interventions and strategic urban planning. The findings reveal that simple day-evening comparatives might overlook nuanced sub-diurnal dynamics, such as potential irrigation-induced warming by shrubs observed at mid-day and the complex trade-offs between radiative and transpirative processes by trees in the afternoon and evening. Additionally, the study identifies cooling effects associated with natural land cover, presenting a critical optimization challenge between compact and open urban forms to effectively modulate near-surface air temperatures.

AB  - Deterioration of the thermal environment in built-up areas poses a serious threat to human health, comfort, and urban infrastructure, while also increasing energy consumption and carbon emissions. This underscores the need to optimize wind environments as a key mitigation strategy for urban areas. This paper analyzed the effects of human activities and natural factors on local cold air in Tianhe District, Guangzhou, from the perspective of local ventilation systems. The KLAM_21 (Kaltluft Abfluss Modell) was used to simulate local cold air flow and delineate climate functional zones. A random forest model, interpreted with the SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method, assessed the impact of various factors on local cold air dynamics. The study found that: (1) The northern mountainous area is a crucial cold source; (2) Some open spaces in the built environment fail to function as effective local cold air corridors; (3) High-intensity urban development hinders local cold air transmission; (4) Water bodies are more effective than green spaces in collecting and transmitting local cold air. This study provided technical methods for identifying climate functional zones and understanding local cold air dynamics, as well as theoretical support for the construction of local ventilation systems in urban areas.

AB  - The rise in extreme heat events has made urban thermal environments a significant constraint on Bike-Sharing Systems (BSS). While many studies have explored the Built Environment (BE) and climate change's impact on Bike-Sharing Usage (BSU), urban thermal environments remain underexplored. This study uses the XGBoost model and SHAP analysis to examine how thermal and other urban environmental factors influence BSU under extreme heat, incorporating dynamic mean radiant temperature (Tmrt) to capture the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of perceived thermal environments. The findings highlight the crucial role of the urban thermal environment in predicting BSU during non-peak daytime hours. Interactions between Tmrt and factors like POI diversity, bus station distance, and other factors vary across time periods. Clustering and heat risk overlay analysis reveal differing resident decisions to "endure" or "avoid" heat risks, offering insights for designing more climate-resilient BSS and enhancing urban mobility strategies under extreme heat conditions.

AB  - This study developed two prediction models for urban fire occurrence and related casualties via a fire accident dataset from Seoul, South Korea, from 2017 to 2021. Our models exhibit improved predictive performance by incorporating built environment features, such as building characteristics and the urban context, alongside weather and demographic data. This approach showed improved predictive performance suitable for public health implementation. Compared with the weather- and demographic-only models, our models had an 18.1 % greater fire occurrence prediction accuracy and a 10.4 % greater casualty prediction accuracy. Major variables affecting fire occurrence include building characteristics, e.g., the floor area ratio (FAR), building age, and commercial building number. Important features affecting casualty occurrence include demographic aspects, e. g., income level and weather, and network-based features, e.g., road connectivity and fire station proximity. These findings suggest that fire prevention strategies and fire casualty prevention strategies may need to differ. Furthermore, we identify high-risk zones by conducting spatial analysis and fire risk and casualty prediction on all buildings by applying our models to Seoul's Gangnam District. These contributions can promote safe and healthy urban environments by improving fire risk prediction accuracy and providing important insights into urban planning for appropriate urban fire accident response and prevention.

AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, and the identification of biomarkers can improve early detection and personalized treatment. In this study, RNA-seq data and gene chip data from TCGA and GEO were used to explore potential biomarkers for CRC. The SMOTE method was used to address class imbalance, and four feature selection algorithms (MCFS, Borota, mRMR, and LightGBM) were used to select genes from the gene expression matrix. Four machine learning algorithms (SVM, XGBoost, RF, and kNN) were then employed to obtain the optimal number of genes for model construction. Through interpretable machine learning (IML), co-predictive networks were generated to identify rules and uncover underlying relationships among the selected genes. Survival analysis revealed that INHBA, FNBP1, PDE9A, HIST1H2BG, and CADM3 were significantly correlated with prognosis in CRC patients. In addition, the CIBERSORT algorithm was used to investigate the proportion of immune cells in CRC tissues, and gene mutation rates for the five selected biomarkers were explored. The biomarkers identified in this study have significant implications for the development of personalized therapies and could ultimately lead to improved clinical outcomes for CRC patients.

AB  - In this paper, a novel single-index model tree (SIMTree) is proposed. It adopts the recursive partitioning strategy and each data segment is modeled by a single-index model (SIM), which is a flexible extension of linear regression with non-parametric link functions. The proposed SIMTree has two major advantages: a) with only a few leaf nodes, it can achieve competitive predictive performance compared to complicated black-box models; b) SIMs fitted on each local data segment are intrinsically interpretable. However, using conventional techniques to build such a SIMTree can be extremely time-consuming. SIM estimation typically involves iterative optimization via Newton-type algorithms; such a resource-intensive estimation procedure is repeatedly used for fitting leaf node SIMs and the search of optimal splits. To make the computation burden affordable, an effective training algorithm is proposed as enabled by the efficient utilization of Stein's lemma and several accelerating strategies in the tree construction algorithm. Moreover, a new Python package simtree is developed with elegant visualization modules that can further facilitate the model interpretation. Numerical results on extensive regression datasets show that SIMTree is an accurate and interpretable machine learning model.

AB  - Despite the substantial number of studies on the relationships between crime patterns and built environments, the impacts of street-level built environments on crime patterns have not been definitively determined due to the limitations of obtaining detailed streetscape data and conventional analysis models. To fill these gaps, this study focuses on the non-linear relationships and threshold effects between built environments and local crime patterns at the level of a street segment in the City of Santa Ana, California. Using Google Street View (GSV) and semantic segmentation techniques, we quantify the features of the built environment in GSV images. Then, we examine the non-linear relationships and threshold effects between built environment factors and crime by applying interpretable machine learning (IML) methods. While the machine learning models, especially Deep Neural Network (DNN), outperformed negative binomial regression in predicting future crime events, particularly advantageous was that they allowed us to obtain a deeper understanding of the complex relationship between crime patterns and environmental factors. The results of interpreting the DNN model through IML indicate that most streetscape elements showed non-linear relationships and threshold effects with crime patterns that cannot be easily captured by conventional regression model specifications. The non-linearities and threshold effects revealed in this study can shed light on the factors associated with crime patterns and contribute to policy development for public safety from crime.

AB  - Agricultural productivity is at risk from plant diseases all across the world, but it is particularly harmful in countries that are developing where farming is crucial to the economy. Avoiding crop failure due to microbes, viruses, fungi, or environmental stress requires the prompt detection of paddy leaf diseases. Traditional disease classification relies on expert knowledge, which farmers may not always have access to. This research proposes a machine learning strategy based on Explainable AI that can assist farmers quickly diagnose and manage rice leaf diseases. To enhance predictive performance by transforming features, an improved Owl Search Optimization (IOSO) algorithm is used. This method not only yields consistent outcomes, but it also provides insights into its decisions, which helps the user better understand and trust the data. The Yeo-Johnson technique is used to alter the statistical information acquired from each image. The next step is to use a Cat Boost classifier to sort the features. Using SHAP analysis and the Cat Boost classifier, this study delves deeper into the model's classification process and the effects of each feature on the model's operation. The ideal transformation method substantially improved performance, leading to an accuracy of up to 98.76%, even though the original model showed a balanced accuracy of less than 75%. This method proved to be the most effective in correctly identifying paddy leaf illnesses, surpassing other models such as SVM, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

AB  - Trihalomethanes (THMs) in drinking water are regulated for carcinogenic health risks. However, frequent water quality monitoring imposes significant resource burdens. This study proposes a framework integrating interpretable machine learning (ML) with virtual data augmentation to predict THM occurrence and associated cancer risks. Based on 146 real samples, this study uniquely uses CODMn(per Chinese standards) as a proxy for THM precursors. The ML results show that the CatBoost model with Bayesian optimization achieves the best R2 values of 0.805-0.960 for THM species and cancer risk using six cost-effective input parameters. SHAP-based feature selection simplifies the model to four key parameters (CODMn, temperature, chlorine, and nitrate), while still maintaining R2 values of 0.803 and 0.915 for T-THMs and cancer risks, respectively, highlighting its effectiveness for low-cost monitoring. Furthermore, a data augmentation method based on Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) is proposed. By preserving the manifold during dimensionality reduction and then generating high-quality virtual data through neighborhood-based interpolation, this method reduced RMSE and MAE by 9.64-12.28 %, outperforming the baseline method using Generative Adversarial Network. These findings support data-driven soft sensing for water quality and health risk management in data-limited areas.

AB  - A precise and efficient runoff forecasting model (RFM) is crucial for proactive government decision-making and risk management in catchment flood protection under changing climates. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to significant advancements in both theoretical research and practical applications within the field of hydrology. However, several challenges hinder the improvement of model accuracy and effectiveness in AI-based RFM. These challenges include the non-stationarity of hydrological data and the need for efficient feature extraction. This study addresses these issues by introducing a Transformer-based RFM (RFM_Trans) framework. Specifically, (1) we tackle the non-stationarity in hydrological data using the RFM_Trans framework and validate its performance on both large CAMELS-GB and local Chao Lake catchment datasets. (2) We employ a feature selection approach that integrates Pearson Correlation Analysis with eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques to provide recommendations for reducing input dimensions. (3) We test performances of different variants in RFM_Trans framework across different lead times. The results show that RFM_Trans statistically outperforms LSTM and Transformer models. The feature selection method identifies three specific features that enhances RFM_Trans performance in Chao Lake. RFM_Trans perform well in lead time less than 15 days. Sparse attention mechanisms demonstrate higher predictive accuracy in shorter lead times (<7 days), whereas full attention architectures exhibit superior performance for longer lead times (7-30 days).

AB  - Reflectance-based photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensors provide flexible options of measuring sites for blood oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) measurement. But they are mostly limited by accuracy, especially when applied to different subjects, due to the diverse human characteristics (skin colors, hair density, etc.) and usage conditions of different sensor settings. This study addresses the estimation of SpO(2) at non-standard measuring sites employing reflectance-based sensors. It proposes an automated construction of subject inclusion-exclusion criteria for SpO(2) measuring devices, using a combination of unsupervised clustering, supervised regression, and model explanations. This is perhaps among the first adaptation of SHAP to explain the clusters gleaned from unsupervised learning methods. As a wellness application case study, we developed a pillow-based wearable device to collect reflectance PPGs from both the brachiocephalic and carotid arteries around the neck. The experiment was conducted on 33 subjects, each under totally 80 different sensor settings. The proposed approach addressed the variations of humans and devices, as well as the heterogeneous mapping between signals and SpO(2) values. It identified effective device settings and characteristics of their applicable subject groups (i.e., subject inclusion-exclusion criteria). Overall, it reduced the root mean squared error (RMSE) by 16%, compared to an empirical formula and a plain SpO(2) estimation model.

AB  - This study addresses the critical global issue of food security, particularly under the influence of climate change on agricultural land suitability. The primary objective of our research is to predict the risks associated with land suitability degradation and changes in irrigation patterns, directly impacting food security. This research aligns with the United Nations' sustainable development goals to reduce hunger and malnutrition. Central Eurasia, a region facing unique economic and social challenges, serves as the focal point of our investigation, providing a pertinent example for analyzing the effects of climate change on food security. In our approach, we employ interpretable machine learning techniques to analyze the impact of climate change on agricultural land suitability under different carbon emission scenarios. The developed model demonstrates strong performance, evidenced by an accuracy of 86% and a mean average precision of 72% in a multi-class land suitability classification task. Focusing on the most vulnerable regions in Eastern Europe and Northern Asia, our research provides crucial insights for policymakers. These insights are instrumental for strategic planning, including the allocation of critical resources like water and fertilizers, to prevent humanitarian crises. The results demonstrate that machine learning can be a powerful tool in predicting and managing the impacts of climate change on food security.

AB  - Credit risk prediction is a critical task in the financial industry, allowing lenders to assess the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. Traditional machine learning (ML) classifiers have been widely used for this purpose, and they often struggle with imbalanced data and lack interpretability, making it challenging for financial institutions to make informed decisions. This article explores the use of ensemble classifiers and Synthetic minority over-sampling Edited nearest neighbor (SMOTE-ENN) technique in credit risk prediction, aiming to improve the classification performance. The ensemble classifiers include Random Forest, adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM). The study addresses the class imbalance issue by leveraging ensemble classifiers and the SMOTE-ENN technique while employing Shapley additive exPlanations (SHAP) for model interpretability. The experimental results showed that the proposed approach resulted in improved classification performance. Specifically, on the German credit dataset, XGBoost outperformed the other models with a Recall of 0.930 and a Specificity of 0.846, while Random Forest obtained the best performance on the Australian dataset, achieving a Recall of 0.907 and Specificity of 0.922. Additionally, the integration of SHAP enhanced the models' transparency by providing valuable insights into the contribution of individual features, which is crucial for informed financial decision-making.

AB  - A popular approach to overcome the complexity of cybersecurity and sophistication of cyber attacks is implementing artificial intelligence (AI)-based security controls that integrate machine learning (ML) algorithms into security controls, such as intrusion and malware detection. These AI-based security controls are considered more effective than traditional signature-based and heuristics-based controls. However, the growing adoption of advanced ML algorithms is turning these AI-based security controls into black-box systems. We postulate that these black-box AI methods would make risk management and informed decision-making challenging. Using smart grid intrusion detection as our context, we illustrate our arguments by outlining a risk assessment plan to discuss the transparency and interpretability of an AI-based security control. We contribute to the literature by changing the focus from performance to explainability of algorithms, highlighting critical steps in explainability for integrating into risk assessment planning, and outlining the implications of explainability in AI-based intrusion detection systems.

AB  - Water Distribution Networks (WDNs) are susceptible to pipe failures with significant consequences. Predicting wall-thickness loss in pipes is vital for proactive maintenance and asset management. This study develops optimized, explainable machine learning models for this purpose. Data from four WDNs located in Canada and the USA are collected and preprocessed. Decision Tree, Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost are employed, with optimized hyperparameters via Tree-Structured Parzen Estimator. The proposed framework performance is assessed using dissimilarity-based and similarity-based metrics. Hyperparameter optimization substantially enhances predictive performance such that the mean absolute error of RF improved by 20.51%. Based on the evaluation metrics, the Copeland algorithm was employed to rank the models, and CatBoost emerged as the best-performing model with a Copeland score of 4, followed by XGBoost and RF. The Taylor Diagram offers a visual representation of the linear proportionality between observed and predicted values across various models, with CatBoost and XGBoost showing strong alignment. SHAP analysis identifies age, diameter, and length as key contributors. The optimized models proactively identify potential pipe failures, enhancing maintenance and WDN management.

AB  - This paper evaluated fraud prediction in property insurance claims using various machine learning models based on real -world data from a major Brazilian insurance company. The models were tested recursively and average predictive results were compared controlling for false positives and false negatives. The results showed that ensemble -based methods (random forest and gradient boosting) and deep neural networks yielded the best results, exhibiting superior average performance in comparison to the other classifiers, including the commonly used logistic regression. In addition, we compiled a general profile of confirmed fraudsters from the dataset and estimated the impact of each feature in the global classification performance and for prominent cases of false positive and false negative predictions using eXplainable Artificial Intelligence methods. The findings of this study can aid risk analysts and professionals in assessing the strengths and weaknesses of each model and to build empirically effective decision rules to evaluate future insurance policies.

AB  - Understanding differences in travel behavior across population groups is fundamental for fostering more comprehensive transportation systems. Big mobile device location data offers new opportunities for larger-scale finer-grained spatial analyses of human mobility. In this study, we analyzed over 3 million vehicle trips in Maryland over a two-month period in 2018 to explore travel behavior differences across income and racial groups. We employed Random Forest models combined with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to interpret how trip distribution, distance, and duration varied with demographic, socioeconomic, and built-environment features. The findings revealed important socio-spatial differences in travel behavior. Racial differences in mobility were associated with population density and indicated the presence of possible mobility segregation. Specifically, trips related to home tracts that were majority Hispanic and Black were concentrated in higherdensity urban areas, while trips related to home tracts that were majority White were more dispersed across the state. Trip distance and duration models showed higher variation across income, age, and racial groups. Tracts with lower median incomes and a higher percentage of older age groups were associated with shorter trips, and tracts with a higher percentage of White population were associated with longer trip distances, particularly in rural census tracts. Additional county-level analysis showed that tracts with a higher percentage of Black population in counties with higher socio-economic status were also associated with longer travel distances. These findings demonstrate the potential of mobile device location data to identify travel behavior differences and reveal important mobility patterns, including mobility segregation, which can help guide local transportation planners in developing transportation systems that improve or expand the activity spaces of different population groups.

AB  - This study explores the potential of conventional Raman spectroscopy and commonly used spectral analysis pipelines for rapid and straightforward assessment of degradation in serum samples resulting from storage delays. Serum samples from 18 volunteers were processed within 2 h of extraction, which later on were analyzed via Raman spectroscopy over 4 days, while the corresponding serum vials were kept at room temperature. The resulting spectra were processed, including silicon normalization and a newly proposed outlier detection ensemble method. Next, baseline correction was performed, and spectral unmixing along with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were applied. Several classification models (KNN, RF, and SVM) were trained and evaluated on three distinct balanced datasets: one including all data, one excluding low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) data, and one excluding low-SNR data with baseline correction. Feature importance, assessed through random permutations, was used for explainability. Spectral unmixing and PCA indicated limited spectral changes directly attributable to analyte degradation, with inter-and intra-sample variability dominating. Classification results showed that while removing the baseline led to inconclusive results, models trained on datasets retaining the baseline effectively identified non-degraded samples. These findings suggest that while conventional Raman spectroscopy may not be optimally sensitive to subtle analyte variations in serum stored at room temperature, the auto-fluorescence background holds promise as a potential biomarker for monitoring serum storage quality.

AB  - The long-term overextraction of groundwater in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region has led to the formation of the world's largest groundwater depression cone and the most extensive land subsidence zone, posing a potential threat to the operational safety of high-speed railways in the region. As a critical transportation hub connecting Beijing and the Xiong'an New Area, the Beijing-Xiong'an Intercity Railway traverses geologically complex areas with significant ground subsidence issues. Monitoring and analyzing the causes of land subsidence along the railway are essential for ensuring its safe operation. Using Sentinel-1A radar imagery, this study applies PS-InSAR technology to extract the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of ground subsidence along the railway from 2016 to 2022. By employing a buffer zone analysis and profile analysis, the subsidence patterns at different stages (pre-construction, construction, and operation) are revealed, identifying the major subsidence cones along the Yongding River, Yongqing, Daying, and Shengfang regions, and their impacts on the railway. Furthermore, the XGBoost model and SHAP method are used to quantify the primary influencing factors of land subsidence. The results show that changes in confined water levels are the most significant factor, contributing 34.5%, with strong interactions observed between the compressible layer thickness and confined water levels. The subsidence gradient analysis indicates that the overall subsidence gradient along the Beijing-Xiong'an Intercity Railway currently meets safety standards. This study provides scientific evidence for risk prevention and the control of land subsidence along the railway and holds significant implications for ensuring the safety of high-speed rail operations.

AB  - This study investigates the impact of a newly implemented public transport interchange discount policy in Suzhou, China, focusing on its effects on metro-to-bus interchange behaviors across various spatial and temporal dimensions. Utilizing two distinct datasets spanning periods before and after the policy's implementation, a comprehensive spatial-temporal analysis was conducted, covering weekdays, weekends, and holidays. A novel, real-time, distance-weighted methodology was developed to more accurately identify metro-to-bus interchange catchments, thereby refining the modeling scope. The study examines the interplay between land use, sociodemographic factors, and bus-related attributes-including a newly proposed operation-opportunity combined bus accessibility metric-using an explainable machine learning approach. Results indicate that the interchange discount policy has had an overall positive, though varied, impact on interchange behaviors, with the most pronounced effects observed during weekdays in central urban areas and at metro line bends. Specifically, 76.1 % of metro stations saw an increase in metro-to-bus interchange ratios on weekdays following the policy's implementation, with increases observed at 66.4 % and 67.3 % of stations during weekends and holidays, respectively. Overall, the interchange ratio increased by 12.49 %, with a 17.45 % increase on weekdays. The analysis also reveals that factors such as bus accessibility, bus-to-bus interchange, and population density exhibit different effects depending on the time of week, with non-linear patterns emerging. The policy's introduction shifted the impact thresholds for certain factors, initially triggering competition between bus and metro services but eventually leading to a synergistic rise in metro-to-bus transfers as bus-to-bus interchange ratios increased. Additionally, the policy altered the significance of population density, enhancing the attractiveness of multimodal interchange for users who previously favored other modes of transport.

AB  - Accurate predictions of forest plantation growth provide forest managers with improved forest inventory estimates, forest valuation, and timely harvest schedules. Forest process-based models are increasingly used for quantifying current and potential productivity, yield gaps, and factors limiting growth, such as climate variability, soil characteristics, and water deficit. Improvements in the availability and resolution of spatial and temporal data combined with advancements in machine learning algorithms provide new opportunities to improve model predictions. This study shows how interpretable machine learning (ML) can be used to independently predict site soil fertility rating (FR) and incorporate these results into the 3-PG forest process-based model to accurately predict plantation growth. Four ensemble decision tree machine learning models-random forest trees, extremely randomized trees, gradient boost, and XG boost-were trained and compared using spatial cross-validation across the study area. FR predictions were estimated in relation to the influencing soil type and terrain characteristics, and interpretable ML methods were used to show how input feature permutations may relate to the soil fertility predictions. The results show the explanatory variables are similar across the selected ML models, with the strongest influencing variables being water leaching index, site aspect, and the silt and sand soil texture properties. The extremely randomized tree models showed the overall best performance, with only a small variation in performance across the four ML models. The method was applied to Eucalyptus nitens plantations covering over 63,000 ha in north-west Tasmania, Australia. The results using the predicted FR spatial grid with 3-PG show a strong correlation with observed growth for tree diameter and stand volume (R-2 tree diameter at breast height = 0.97, RMSE = 0.85 m; R-2 stand volume = 0.96, RMSE = 23.1 m(3) ha(-1)) obtained from 161 permanent sample inventory plots ranging from 3 to 31 years old. This method has practical utility for other study sites to calibrate forest plantation soil fertility rating, in both the spatial and point-scale 3-PG model, where spatial data of soil characteristics are available. The derived soil fertility grid can provide valuable insights into the spatial variability of soil fertility in unknown areas.

AB  - Measuring perceptions of visual walkability in urban streets and exploring the associations between the visual features of the street built environment that make walking attractive to humans are both theoretically and practically important. Previous studies have used either environmental audits and subjective evaluations that have limitations in terms of cost, time, and measurement scale, or computer-aided audits based on natural street view images (SVIs) but with gaps in real perception. In this study, a virtual reality panoramic image-based deep learning framework is proposed for measuring visual walkability perception (VWP) and then quantifying and visualizing the contributing visual features. A VWP classification deep multitask learning (VWPCL) model was first developed and trained on human ratings of panoramic SVIs in virtual reality to predict VWP in six categories. Second, a regression model was used to determine the degree of correlation of various objects with one of the six VWP categories based on semantic segmentation. Furthermore, an interpretable deep learning model was used to assist in identifying and visualizing elements that contribute to VWP. The experiment validated the accuracy of the VWPCL model for predicting VWP. The results represent a further step in understanding the interplay of VWP and street-level semantics and features.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing across technology domains including healthcare, commerce, the economy, the environment, cybersecurity, transportation, etc. AI will transform healthcare systems, bringing profound changes to diagnosis, treatment, patient care, data, medicines, devices, etc. However, AI in healthcare introduces entirely new categories of risk for assessment, management, and communication. For this topic, the framing of conventional risk and decision analyses is ongoing. This paper introduces a method to quantify risk as the disruption of the order of AI initiatives in healthcare systems, aiming to find the scenarios that are most and least disruptive to system order. This novel approach addresses scenarios that bring about a re-ordering of initiatives in each of the following three characteristic layers: purpose, structure, and function. In each layer, the following model elements are identified: 1. Typical research and development initiatives in healthcare. 2. The ordering criteria of the initiatives. 3. Emergent conditions and scenarios that could influence the ordering of the AI initiatives. This approach is a manifold accounting of the scenarios that could contribute to the risk associated with AI in healthcare. Recognizing the context-specific nature of risks and highlighting the role of human in the loop, this study identifies scenario s.06-non-interpretable AI and lack of human-AI communications-as the most disruptive across all three layers of healthcare systems. This finding suggests that AI transparency solutions primarily target domain experts, a reasonable inclination given the significance of "high-stakes" AI systems, particularly in healthcare. Future work should connect this approach with decision analysis and quantifying the value of information. Future work will explore the disruptions of system order in additional layers of the healthcare system, including the environment, boundary, interconnections, workforce, facilities, supply chains, and others.

AB  - Motivation Protein essentiality is usually accepted to be a conditional trait and strongly affected by cellular environments. However, existing computational methods often do not take such characteristics into account, preferring to incorporate all available data and train a general model for all cell lines. In addition, the lack of model interpretability limits further exploration and analysis of essential protein predictions. Results In this study, we proposed DeepCellEss, a sequence-based interpretable deep learning framework for cell line-specific essential protein predictions. DeepCellEss utilizes a convolutional neural network and bidirectional long short-term memory to learn short- and long-range latent information from protein sequences. Further, a multi-head self-attention mechanism is used to provide residue-level model interpretability. For model construction, we collected extremely large-scale benchmark datasets across 323 cell lines. Extensive computational experiments demonstrate that DeepCellEss yields effective prediction performance for different cell lines and outperforms existing sequence-based methods as well as network-based centrality measures. Finally, we conducted some case studies to illustrate the necessity of considering specific cell lines and the superiority of DeepCellEss. We believe that DeepCellEss can serve as a useful tool for predicting essential proteins across different cell lines.

TI  - Quantifying the nonlinear effects of urban-rural blue-green landscape combination patterns on the trade-off between carbon sinks and surface temperature: An approach based on self-organizing mapping and interpretable machine learning

AB  - Global urbanization has exacerbated the heat island effect and carbon emissions, and urban and rural blue-green landscapes are critical for mitigating climate change. Traditional research has overlooked the non-linear mechanisms of the trade-off between carbon sinks and heat island effects, as well as heterogeneous landscape assemblages. Using the Harbin-Changchun Urban Agglomeration in China as an illustration, this investigation integrates a self-organized mapping model and an interpretable machine learning method to establish a characterization framework for blue-green landscape assemblages. The objective is to quantify the response mechanisms and nonlinear thresholds of net primary productivity (NPP) of vegetation, land surface temperature (LST), and their trade-offs. The findings demonstrated that (1) a total of seven types of blue-green landscape combination patterns were identified, with woodland-aggregated landscapes being the dominant type, which could achieve high NPP with low LST. (2) The thresholds of forested land percentage (FP), vegetation cover (FVC), and elevation coefficient of variation (ECV) were the primary factors influencing NPP, while FVC was more influential in regulating the marginal effect of LST. (3) Enhancing carbon sinks and regulating surface temperature can be achieved by maintaining FP within the range of 0.5-0.75. The lowest trade-off between NPP and LST can be achieved by setting FVC to 0.6. (4) It is imperative to prevent the functional attenuation that is caused by inefficient combinations of indicators and extreme threshold intervals, as NPP, LST, and their trade-offs are subject to the comprehensive influence of the interaction of multiple indicators. This study identified fine control thresholds for blue-green landscapes that are based on the characteristics of the landscape assemblage. These thresholds can serve as a spatial decision-making foundation for the mitigation of urban heat islands and the attainment of carbon neutrality standards.

AB  - Station-level ridership is an important indicator for understanding the relationship between land use and rail transit, which is crucial for building more sustainable urban mobility systems. However, the nonlinear effects of the built environment on metro ridership, particularly concerning temporal heterogeneity, have not been adequately explained. To address this gap, this study proposes a versatile methodology that employs the eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) tree to analyze the effects of factors on station-level ridership variations and compares these results with those of a multiple regression model. In contrast to conventional feature interpretation methods, this study utilized Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) to detail the nonlinear effects of each factor on station-level ridership across temporal dimensions (weekdays and weekends). Using Shanghai as a case study, the findings confirmed the presence of complex nonlinear and threshold effects of land-use, transportation, and station-type factors on station-level ridership in the association. The factor "Commercial POI" represents the most significant influence on ridership changes in both the weekday and weekend models; "Public Facility Station" plays a role in increasing passenger flow in the weekend model, but it shows the opposite effect on the change in ridership in the weekday model. This study highlights the importance of explainable machine learning methods for comprehending the nonlinear influences of various factors on station-level ridership.

AB  - Good explanations help people understand hateful memes and mitigate sharing. While AI-enabled automatic detection has proliferated, we argue that quality-controlled crowdsourcing can be an effective strategy to offer good explanations for hateful memes. This paper proposes a Generate-Annotate-Revise workflow to crowdsource explanations and presents the results from two user studies. Study 1 evaluated the objective quality of the explanation with three measurements: detailedness, completeness, and accuracy, and suggested that the proposed workflow generated higher quality explanations than the ones from a single-stage workflow without quality control. Study 2 used an online experiment to examine how different explanations affect users' perception. The results from 127 participants demonstrated that people without prior cultural knowledge gained significant perceived understanding and awareness of hateful memes when presented with explanations generated by the proposed multi-stage workflow as opposed to single-stage or machine-generated explanations.

AB  - Bean rust and angular leaf spot pose significant challenges to bean cultivation, impacting yields. Prompt disease identification maximizes productivity, but traditional methods need specialized expertise. This research presents an explainable deep learning model that combines the Pyramid Vision Transformer (PVT) and Group Context Aware Depthwise Shuffle Network (GCADSN). The PVT effectively models long-range dependencies, identifying disease patterns across larger leaf areas, while the GCADSN focuses on capturing nuanced, context-specific features. This combined approach leads to a richer representation of the input image, resulting in improved disease classification. Model explainability is provided through GradCAM visualizations, highlighting the image regions crucial for the model's predictions and enabling transparent, class-specific insights. The model's performance was rigorously tested using the IBean dataset, a collection of images depicting various bean leaf diseases, including common rust, angular leaf spot, and healthy leaves. Our proposed network achieved a high accuracy of 97.66%, outperforming many current state-of-the-art deep learning models. Furthermore, it demonstrated strong performance across other key metrics, with an F1 score of 97.67%, precision of 97.83%, and recall of 97.67%. Importantly, the model's computational efficiency makes it well-suited for practical application in real-world agricultural scenarios.

AB  - This study examines factors beyond macroscale built environments (BE) influencing cycling behavior, integrating both microscale visual and auditory perceptions, especially soundscapes, while their impacts on cycling have not been explicitly investigated. Leveraging massive bike-share trip data in Shenzhen, China, this study employs spatial explainable machine learning to uncover the associations among these three dimensions and cycling behavior using a multi-scale analytical framework. The results show that: (1) Macroscale BE remains dominant, while micro-scale soundscapes outweigh visual perceptions in explaining cycling usage. (2) Both perceived streetscape and soundscape indicators exhibit significant nonlinear effects on cycling behavior. (3) Synergistic interactions between visual streetscape and soundscape are observed, where maintaining audio-visual consistency (e.g., high perceived safety with high natural sounds perception) can positively affect cycling more substantially. Our findings encourage planners to prioritize strategic micro-level modifications targeting perceived street visual and auditory aspects over conventional macroscale BE interventions as cost-effective alternatives.

AB  - The reciprocal relationship between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) highlights their synergistic potential in enhancing artificial intelligence (AI) applications. LLMs, with their natural language understanding and generative capabilities, support the automation of KG construction through entity recognition, relation extraction, and schema generation. Conversely, KGs serve as structured and interpretable data sources that improve the transparency, factual consistency and reliability of LLM-based applications, mitigating challenges such as hallucinations and lack of explainability. This study conducts a systematic literature review of 77 studies to examine AI methodologies supporting LLM-KG integration, including symbolic AI, machine learning, and hybrid approaches. The research explores diverse applications spanning healthcare, finance, justice, and industrial automation, revealing the transformative potential of this synergy. Through in-depth analysis, this study identifies key limitations in current approaches, including challenges in scalability with maintaining dynamic and real-time Knowledge Graphs, difficulty in adapting general-purpose LLMs to specialized domains, limited explainability in tracing model outputs to interpretable reasoning, and ethical concerns surrounding bias, fairness, and transparency. In response, the study highlights potential strategies to optimize LLM-KG synergy. The findings from this study provide actionable insights for researchers and practitioners aiming for robust, transparent, and adaptive AI systems to enhance knowledge-driven AI applications through LLM-KG integration, further advancing generative AI and explainable AI (XAI) applications.

AB  - Climate hazards are escalating in frequency and severity, with flooding escalating as a major threat. The limitations of the existing analytical necessitate and computational tools for flood risk management necessitates a shift towards more data-driven flood risk management strategies informed by AI-driven tools and methods. This paper explores the forefront of flood risk management focusing on integrating artificial intelligence (AI), specifically machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) technologies. By reviewing hundreds of relevant studies, we present a comprehensive analysis of AI applications in flood risk management by examining flood types, AI models, spatial scales, input data, and practical applications, to provide a holistic view of the current landscape and future potential of AI-enhanced flood risk management. We highlight the extent to which AI-driven solutions can complement the existing tools to enhance the reliability of flood predictions and inform mitigation and response strategies. The paper also address prevailing challenges, including data bias and the need for explainable AI models, and proposes pathways for future research to fully harness AI's potential in mitigating flood risks. The analysis underscores AI's promising potential in improving adaptive flood risk management, which is crucial for safeguarding communities and infrastructures against the escalating challenges posed by floods.

TI  - Application of Interpretable Machine-Learning Workflows To Identify Brittle, Fracturable, and Producible Rock in Horizontal Wells Using Surface Drilling Data
T2  - SPE RESERVOIR EVALUATION & ENGINEERING
LA  - English
AB  - In this study, we demonstrate the application of an interpretable (or explainable) machine-learning workflow using surface drilling data to identify fracturable, brittle, and productive rock intervals along horizontal laterals in the Marcellus Shale. The results are supported by a thorough model-agnostic interpretation of the input/output relationships to make the model explainable to users. The methodology described here can easily be generalized to real-time processing of surface drilling data for optimal landing of laterals, placing of fracture stages, optimizing production, and minimizing fracture hits. In practice, this information is rarely available in real time and requires tedious and time-consuming processing of logs (including image logs), core, microseismic data, and fiber-optic-sensor data to provide post-job validation of fracture and well placement. Post-completion analyses are generally too late for corrective action, leading to wells with a low probability of success and increasing risk of fracture hits. Our workflow involves identifying geomechanical facies from core and well-log data. We verify that the geomechanical facies derived using core and well-log data have characteristically different brittleness, fracturability, and production characteristics. We test and investigate several different supervised classifiers to relate surface drilling data to the geomechanical facies. The data were divided into training and test data sets, with supervised classification techniques being able to accurately predict the geomechanical facies with 75% accuracy on the test data set. The clusters predicted on test well (unseen data) were qualitatively verified using the microseismic interpretation. The use of Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) helps explain the predictive models, rank the importance of various inputs in the prediction of the facies, and provides both local and global sensitivities. Our study demonstrates that pre-existing natural-fracture networks control both the hydraulic-fracture geometry as well as the production. Natural fractures promote the formation of complex fracture networks with shorter half-lengths, which increase well productivity while minimizing fracture hits and neighboring-well interactions. The natural-fracture network is itself controlled by the geomechanical properties of the rock. The ability of the surface drilling data to reliably predict the geomechanical rock facies provides a powerful tool for real-time optimization of wellbore trajectory and completions.

AB  - During rapid urbanization and increase in motorization, it becomes particularly important to understand the relationships between traffic safety and risk factors in order to provide targeted improvements and policy rec-ommendations. Violations and police enforcement are key variables, but the endogenous relationship between crashes and violations has made these variables unreliable and has limited their use. To manage this problem, this study developed a systematic approach for the joint modeling of crashes and violations to identify crash and violation hotspots and examine the mechanisms underlying macro-level contributing factors. Socio-economic, road network, public facility, traffic enforcement, and land use intensity data from 115 towns in Suzhou, China, were collected as independent variables. A bivariate negative binomial spatial conditional autoregressive model (BNB-CAR) and the potential for safety improvement (PSI) method were adopted to identify crash-prone and violation-prone areas, and an interpretable machine learning framework was applied to explore the factors' effects by area. Results showed that the proposed framework was able to accurately identify problem areas and quantify the impact of key factors, which, in Suzhou, were the number of traffic police and their daily patrol time. Considering such enforcement-related information provided important insights into reducing crash and violation frequency; for example, keeping the number of traffic police and daily patrol time under certain thresholds (number of police lower than 11 and patrol time lower than 2.3 h in this sample) was as effective as increasing these numbers for reducing the probability of high-crash and high-violation areas. The proposed approach can help traffic administrators identify the key contributing factors, especially enforcement factors, in crash-prone and violation-prone areas and provide guidelines for improvement.

AB  - Steel circular hollow section (CHS) members are widely utilized as axial force-resisting structural members in civil engineering structures. The buckling strength under axial loads is one of the critical parameters to determine the performance of the steel CHS members, which is significantly affected by the discreteness introduced by geometries, material, and initial imperfections. However, the reduction factor employed in the modern design codes (i.e. Chinese codes and EC3) only accounts for the reduction caused by all kinds of discreteness and does not reflect the impacts of every single discreteness and imperfection. To fill the gap, this paper proposed an interpretable machine-learning method to provide the probabilistic axial buckling strength of steel CHS members prediction result in a distribution form with the consideration of detailed discreteness. The model to predict the nominal axial buckling strength of steel CHS members was first developed utilizing ten machine learning algorithms after sufficient numerical simulations, where the numerical model was verified using test results. The artificial neural network (ANN) was selected for developing the prediction model due to its highly reliable performance in testing. The developed ANN models were further interpreted utilizing Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to determine the interrelationship of different parameters. Then, the probabilistic axial bucking strength prediction model was established based on the developed ANN models, where the Latin hypercube sampling method was applied to address the discreteness of geometries, material, and initial imperfections. The generated probabilistic axial bucking strength prediction model's effectiveness was verified by the evidence that the machine learning prediction results can highly match the numerical results' probability density function and the result from codes while significantly reducing the computation time. Finally, the design parameters' impact on the axial buckling strength's discreteness was evaluated using the global sensitivity analysis (GSA) method. The result shows that the discreteness of design parameters substantially influences the distribution of the axial buckling strength of the steel CHS members and the proposed prediction model can provide an accurate probabilistic distribution prediction.

AB  - Complex Machine Learning (ML) models used to support decision-making in peer-to-peer (P2P) lending often lack clear, accurate, and interpretable explanations. While the game-theoretic concept of Shapley values and its computationally efficient variant Kernel SHAP may be employed for this aim, similarly to other existing methods, the latter makes the assumption that the features are independent. The assumption of uncorrelated features in credit risk management is fairly restrictive and, thus, prediction explanations coming from correlated features might result in highly misleading Shapley values, even when considering simple models. We therefore propose an evaluation of different dependent-feature estimation methods of Kernel SHAP for classification purposes in credit risk management. We show that dependent-feature estimation of Shapley values can improve the understanding of true prediction explanations, their robustness and is essential for better identifying the most relevant variables to default predictions coming from black-box ML models.

AB  - BackgroundThe ruminant gastrointestinal contains numerous microbiomes that serve a crucial role in sustaining the host's productivity and health. In recent times, numerous studies have revealed that variations in influencing factors, including the environment, diet, and host, contribute to the shaping of gastrointestinal microbial adaptation to specific states. Therefore, understanding how host and environmental factors affect gastrointestinal microbes will help to improve the sustainability of ruminant production systems.ResultsBased on a graphical analysis perspective, this study elucidates the microbial topology and robustness of the gastrointestinal of different ruminant species, showing that the microbial network is more resistant to random attacks. The risk of transmission of high-risk metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) was also demonstrated based on a large-scale survey of the distribution of antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) in the microbiota of most types of ecosystems. In addition, an interpretable machine learning framework was developed to study the complex, high-dimensional data of the gastrointestinal microbial genome. The evolution of gastrointestinal microbial adaptations to the environment in ruminants were analyzed and the adaptability changes of microorganisms to different altitudes were identified, including microbial transcriptional repair.ConclusionOur findings indicate that the environment has an impact on the functional features of microbiomes in ruminant. The findings provide a new insight for the future development of microbial resources for the sustainable development in agriculture.

AB  - A design exploration of hexachiral structures using explainable machine learning (ML) is performed in this work. The hexachiral structures are fabricated using resin via vat photopolymerization (VPP). The ML model is used to build the function that explains the association between Poisson's ratio and the hexachiral design parameters. The data set for ML model construction is first collected by using the Halton sequence and simulated using the finite element method (FEM). To validate the data set, the results obtained from the FEM simulation are compared with those obtained from the compression test. The Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) models for Poisson's ratio and porosity are constructed to extract important design insight. A Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) are used to analyze the sensitivity of the porosity and Poisson's ratio to the hexachiral design parameters. GSA result shows that the strut's thickness is the most decisive parameter that affects the Poisson's ratio. The application of SHAP also reveals that the relationship between the strut thickness and Poisson's ratio is nonlinear. Finally, the minimum Poisson's ratio value is achieved by design with minimum strut thickness, minimum node radius, and maximum strut length.(c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)-resis-- tant Kawasaki disease is associated with coronary artery lesion development. Purpose: This study aimed to explore the factors asso-- ciated with IVIG-resistance and construct and validate an interpretable machine learning (ML) prediction model in clinical practice. Methods: Between December 2014 and November 2022, 602 patients were screened and risk factors for IVIGresistance investigated. Five ML models are used to esta-- blish an optimal prediction model. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was used to interpret the ML model. Results: Na+ , + , hemoglobin (Hb), C-reactive protein (CRP), and globulin were independent risk factors for IVIGresistance. A nonlinear relationship was identified between globulin level and IVIG-resistance. The XGBoost model exhibited excellent performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.821, accuracy of 0.748, sensitivity of 0.889, and specificity of 0.683 in the testing set. The XGBoost model was interpreted globally and locally using the SHAP method. Conclusion: Na+, Hb, CRP, and globulin levels were independently associated with IVIG-resistance. Our find-- ings demonstrate that ML models can reliably predict IVIG-resistance. Moreover, use of the SHAP method to interpret the established XGBoost model's findings would provide evidence of IVIG-resistance and guide the indi-- vidualized treatment of Kawasaki disease.

AB  - In the context of climate change and ecological degradation, enhancing cropland productivity in Northeast China is essential for ensuring national food security. This study adopted an integrated framework combining the optimal parameter-based geographical detector (OPGD) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to identify key drivers of average and total cropland productivity at the county level from 2001 to 2020. Growing-season-based cropland Net Primary Productivity (NPP) was estimated using the CASA model to represent cropland productivity. Results indicated that natural and ecological factors significantly dominated the spatial variation of cropland productivity, with their interactions amplified through dual-factor or nonlinear enhancements. Various machine learning models were fine-tuned and compared, and optimal models were selected for subsequent SHAP analysis. The findings revealed that erosion intensity exhibited the most significant impact on cropland productivity, whereas the effect of precipitation shifted from negative to positive, with a clear threshold of around 400 mm-matching the boundary between China's semi-arid and semi-humid regions. Low-elevation plains (<300 m) and gentle slopes (<0.5 degrees) predominately promoted total cropland productivity. Interactions between erosion and fertilizer intensity highlighted the need for moderate fertilization to prevent ecological degradation in severely eroded counties. These findings provide scientific support for targeted cropland management aimed at achieving sustainable agriculture in Northeast China.

AB  - This paper introduces a new high-performance machine learning tool named Silas, which is built to provide a more transparent, dependable and efficient data analytics service. We discuss the machine learning aspects of Silas and demonstrate the advantage of Silas in its predictive and computational performance. We show that several customised algorithms in Silas yield better predictions in a significantly shorter time compared to the state-of-the-art. Another focus of Silas is on providing a formal foundation of decision trees to support logical analysis and verification of learned prediction models. We illustrate the potential capabilities of the fusion of machine learning and logical reasoning by showcasing applications in three directions: formal verification of the prediction model against user specifications, training correct-by-construction models, and explaining the decision-making of predictions.

AB  - In light of the ongoing battle against COVID-19, while the pandemic may eventually subside, sporadic cases may still emerge, underscoring the need for accurate detection from radiological images. However, the limited explainability of current deep learning models restricts clinician acceptance. To address this issue, our research integrates multiple CNN models with explainable AI techniques, ensuring model interpretability before ensemble construction. Our approach enhances both accuracy and interpretability by evaluating advanced CNN models on the largest publicly available X-ray dataset, COVIDx CXR-3, which includes 29,986 images, and the CT scan dataset for SARS-CoV-2 from Kaggle, which includes a total of 2,482 images. We also employed additional public datasets for cross-dataset evaluation, ensuring a thorough assessment of model performance across various imaging conditions. By leveraging methods including LIME, SHAP, Grad-CAM, and Grad-CAM++, we provide transparent insights into model decisions. Our ensemble model, which includes DenseNet169, ResNet50, and VGG16, demonstrates strong performance. For the X-ray image dataset, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F1-score, and AUC are recorded at 99.00%, 99.00%, 99.00%, 0.99, and 0.99, respectively. For the CT image dataset, these metrics are 96.18%, 96.18%, 96.18%, 0.9618, and 0.96, respectively. Our methodology bridges the gap between precision and interpretability in clinical settings by combining model diversity with explainability, promising enhanced disease diagnosis and greater clinician acceptance.

AB  - Ridesharing is critical for promoting transportation sustainability. As a new form of ridesharing services, ridesplitting has rarely been studied. Based on the Chicago ridesourcing trip data, this study explores how ridesplitting adoption rate (i.e., the proportion of ridesourcing trips with ridesharing authorization) varies across space and what factors are associated with these variations. We find large variations in ridesplitting adoption rates across neighborhoods (Census Tracts) and across origin-destination (Census-Tract-to-Census-Tract) pairs. Particularly, the ridesplitting adoption rate is low for airport rides. We further apply a random forest model to explore which factors are key predictors of ridesplitting adoption rate across O-D pairs and to explore their nonlinear associations. The results suggest that the socioeconomic and demographic variables collectively contribute to 68.60% of the predictive power of the model, but travel-cost variables and built-environment-related factors are also important. The most important variables associated with ridesplitting adoption are ethnic composition, median household income, education level, trip distance, and neighborhood density. We further examine the nonlinear association between neighborhood ridesplitting adoption rate and several key variables such as the percentage of white population, median household income, and neighborhood Walk Score. The revealed nonlinear patterns can help transportation professionals identify neighborhoods with the greatest potential to promote ridesplitting.

AB  - Zanthoxylum plants are usually deciduous trees or shrubs of Rutaceae, as industrial crops widely cultivated in China. Three representative Zanthoxylum species, Z. bungeanum, Z. schinifolium, and Z. armatum, are well-known for their pericarps rich in bioactive compounds and can be utilized as functional additives or phytomedicine. These mentioned Zanthoxylum species are distributed and intermixed with each other as "Zanthoxylum" on markets, which creates obstacles for consumers to identify them. In the present study, 49 batches of Zanthoxylum extracts were examined for anti-inflammatory activity and then employed in acquiring corresponding multiconstituent profiles by UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap-HRMS and UHPLC-MS/MS. The obtained data were further used for the construction of extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) classification and regression models. A Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) algorithm was subsequently applied to interpret the XGBoost classification/regression model output for desirable information. Isoquercitrin, rutin, and arctigenin were identified as the important chemical markers for discriminating Zanthoxylum origins through the classification algorithm. Furthermore, six constituents, consisting of hydroxy-gamma-sanshool, avicularin, bergapten, rutin, scopoletin, and narcissoside, were screened for their major anti-inflammatory activity by modeling using the regression approach. Unraveling the diversities and connections of constituents and biological activities in these three species could contribute to their reasonable industrial and medicinal applications.

AB  - carbon dioxide (CO2) fertilization effect has captured worldwide attention, owing to its tremendous potential to challenge existing predictions of future climate. However, quantifying the CO2 fertilization effect (CFE) has proven to be challenging, given that it is closely entangled with other ecological and environmental processes. Recent years have wit-nessed significant advances with breakthroughs using theoretical methods to infer the CFE from eddy covariance tower mea-surements. Building on earlier findings, this study presents an innovative approach that utilizes explainable machine-learning techniques-describing the partial dependence of the response variable to each explanatory variable-to quantify the global CFE from remote-sensing platforms with an averaged R2 of 0.85. This study provides the first data-driven evidence of the global CFE and confirms the potential for extrapolation to the globe. The findings suggest that: 1) the employment of satellite vegetation proxies contributed to more than 50% of the fitting of gross primary productivity (GPP) and 2) the manifestation of the CO2 fertilization impact demonstrated heterogeneity among various types of ecosystems, and in some cases, an adverse effect was detected in broadleaf forests. Our results have significant implications for the preservation and protection of terrestrial ecosystems, particularly for a carbon-neutral future. This study, therefore, provides a valuable contribution to the growing body of knowledge in this area and highlights the potential of innovative analytical techniques to address complex ecological challenges.

AB  - Recently, the term explainable AI came into discussion as an approach to produce models from artificial intelligence which allow interpretation. For a long time, symbolic regression has been used to produce explainable and mathematically tractable models. In this contribution, we extend previous work on symbolic regression methods to infer the optimal control of a dynamical system given one or several optimization criteria, or cost functions. In earlier publications, network control was achieved by automated machine learning control using genetic programming. Here, we focus on the subsequent path continuation analysis of the mathematical expressions which result from the machine learning model. In particular, we use AUTO to analyze the solution properties of the controlled oscillator system which served as our model. As a result, we show that there is a considerable advantage of explainable symbolic regression models over less accessible neural networks. In particular, the roadmap of future works may be to integrate such analyses into the optimization loop itself to filter out robust solutions by construction. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Explanation has been a central feature of AI systems for legal reasoning since their inception. Recently, the topic of explanation of decisions has taken on a new urgency, throughout AI in general, with the increasing deployment of AI tools and the need for lay users to be able to place trust in the decisions that the support tools are recommending. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the variety of techniques for explanation that have been developed in AI and Law. We summarise the early contributions and how these have since developed. We describe a number of notable current methods for automated explanation of legal reasoning and we also highlight gaps that must be addressed by future systems to ensure that accurate, trustworthy, unbiased decision support can be provided to legal professionals. We believe that insights from AI and Law, where explanation has long been a concern, may provide useful pointers for future development of explainable AI. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction Septic patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) readmission are at high risk of mortality, but research focusing on the association of ICU readmission due to sepsis and mortality is limited. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a machine learning (ML) model for predicting in-hospital mortality in septic patients readmitted to the ICU using routinely available clinical data. Methods The data used in this study were obtained from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV, v1.0) database, between 2008 and 2019. The study cohort included patients with sepsis requiring ICU readmission. The data were randomly split into a training (75%) data set and a validation (25%) data set. Nine popular ML models were developed to predict mortality in septic patients readmitted to the ICU. The model with the best accuracy and area under the curve (A.C.) in the validation cohort was defined as the optimal model and was selected for further prediction studies. The SHAPELY Additive explanations (SHAP) values and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanation (LIME) methods were used to improve the interpretability of the optimal model. Results A total of 1117 septic patients who had required ICU readmission during the study period were enrolled in the study. Of these participants, 434 (38.9%) were female, and the median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 68.6 (58.4-79.2) years. The median (IQR) ICU interval duration was 2.60 (0.64-5.78) days. After feature selection, 31 of 47 clinical factors were ultimately chosen for use in model construction. Of the nine ML models tested, the best performance was achieved with the random forest (RF) model, with an A.C. of 0.81, an accuracy of 85% and a precision of 62% in the validation cohort. The SHAP summary analysis revealed that Glasgow Coma Scale score, urine output, blood urea nitrogen, lactate, platelet count and systolic blood pressure were the top six most important factors contributing to the RF model. Additionally, the LIME method demonstrated how the RF model works in terms of explaining risk of death prediction in septic patients requiring ICU readmission. Conclusion The ML models reported here showed a good prognostic prediction ability in septic patients requiring ICU readmission. Of the features selected, the parameters related to organ perfusion made the largest contribution to outcome prediction during ICU readmission in septic patients.

AB  - The deck condition of bridges is one of the most important factors impacting the connectivity and efficiency of transportation networks. Bridges with quickly deteriorating deck conditions are a huge financial burden for transportation agencies and can downgrade the efficiency of the whole transportation network. This study utilizes an interpretable machine learning framework, Shapley additive explanation (SHAP), to investigate the associations between various factors, such as wearing surface, deck structure, and so forth, and bridges with quickly deteriorating deck conditions nationwide. An XGBoost model is trained to perform the binary classification task on a heavily imbalanced dataset and classify relatively young bridges (less than 20 years old) with poor/fair deck conditions and relatively old bridges (30-40 years old) with good deck conditions in the National Bridge Inventory (NBI) database. The accuracy of the predictive model is 0.91, and the AUC score is about 0.83. After applying this well-performed predictive model on the interpretable machine learning framework, the results revealed that without wearing surface, corrugated steel deck structure, wide bridge structure, and long span are highly associated with bridges with quickly deteriorating decks. The results also show that bridges with a relatively low average daily traffic (ADT) or truck percentage of ADT are in a dilemma zone, where the overall traffic or truck volume of the bridge is not low enough to prevent fast deterioration, but not high enough for eligibility for the funding required for more durable materials during construction or appropriate maintenance.

AB  - Free-floating bike-sharing systems (FFBS), known for their convenience and low-carbon benefits, have become crucial for advancing green urban mobility and sustainable development. However, the specific impacts of urban greening structures on FFBS usage remain underexplored. This study focuses on Shenzhen's core area, systematically evaluating the effects of greening structures on FFBS usage at different times by integrating street view images, remote sensing data, and interpretable machine learning models. Results indicate that daytime cycling is mainly influenced by trip purposes and urban morphology, while nighttime cycling depends more heavily on urban greening structures. Among greening factors, tree view index exhibits the most substantial nonlinear impact on cycling across all time periods. Factors like the bush view index, vegetation configuration ratios, and green space shape characteristics are more influential at nighttime. This study highlights the crucial role of location-specific greening optimization strategies in promoting sustainable green transportation development.

AB  - Pests significantly impact agricultural productivity, making early detection crucial for maximizing yields. This paper explores the use of machine learning models to predict olive fly and red spider mite infestations in Andalusia. Four datasets on crop phenology, pest populations, and damage levels were used, with models developed using the Python package H2O, which focuses on interpretability through SHAP values and ICE plots. The results showed high precision in predicting pest outbreaks, particularly for the olive fly, with minimal differences between models using feature selection. In the vineyard dataset, the selection of characteristics improved the performance of the model by reducing the MAE and increasing R-2 . Explainability techniques identified solar radiation and wind direction as key factors in olive fly predictions, while past pest occurrences and wind velocity were influential for red spider mites, providing farmers with actionable insights for timely pest control.

AB  - Memristive LSTM networks have been proven as a powerful Neuromorphic Computing Architecture (NCA) for various time series forecasting tasks and are recognized as the next generation of AI. However, a lack of model explainability makes it hard to properly interpret forecasting results for existing memristive LSTM networks, which makes this NCA unreliable, unaccountable and untrustworthy. In this paper, an interpretable memristive (IM) LSTM network design is proposed for time series forecasting, where the mixture attention technique is embedded into IM-LSTM cells for characterizing the variable-wise feature and the temporal importance. The updating rules and training approach are also presented for this interpretable memristive LSTM network. We evaluate this approach on a probabilistic residential load forecasting task incorporating PV. By improving model interpretability, the most influential predictive factors can be verified by Built Environment domain experts, demonstrating the effectiveness of our design.

AB  - Downtime caused by equipment failure is the biggest productivity problem in the 24-hour a day operations of the semiconductor industry. Although some equipment failures are inevitable, increases in productivity can be gained if the causes of failures can be detected quickly and repaired, thus reducing downtime. Univariate control charts are commonly used to detect failures. However, because of the complexity of the process and the structural characteristics of the equipment, detection and identification of the causes of failures may be difficult. The purpose of this study is to use correlations of variables to detect failures in semiconductor equipment, to predict the parts to be replaced and to identify the primary causes of failures. The proposed method consists of four steps: (1) conversion of the multivariate time series data of the equipment into signature matrixes, (2) detection of anomalies through a convolutional autoencoder, (3) learning classification models with supervised learning methods that use the residual matrixes of fault sections, and (4) application of an explainable algorithm to interpret the classification model. The effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method are demonstrated by the actual multivariate time series data obtained from 8-inch ashing process equipment that produces semiconductors on 8-inch silicon wafers.

AB  - Drought significantly affects terrestrial vegetation. Although several studies have explored vegetation response patterns to drought (VRPD), the dynamics and underlying driving factors remain unclear. This study examined the dynamics of VRPD using long-term gross primary productivity (GPP) data and multi-scale standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) across China's Loess Plateau (CLP). Our results indicate that vegetation in the semi-arid zone of CLP is most impacted by drought and exhibits the fastest response to drought. From 1982 to 2018, drought impacts on vegetation in the region significantly weakened, while vegetation response time to drought also significantly shortened (p < 0.01). Explainable machine learning analysis revealed that the reduced impact of drought on vegetation is due to increased precipitation and vegetation recovery. In contrast, shortened response time is associated with increased downward surface shortwave radiation and temperature. These results suggest that under the background of climate change and vegetation recovery, the VRPD in CLP significantly changed, highlight the necessary to strike a balance between ecological restoration and climate adaptation for ensuring the CLP evolves from "greening" toward "sustainably green".

AB  - During virtual reality-based safety training, it is necessary to immediately and objectively evaluate personal learning performance. In light of this, this study proposed an interpretable machine learning approach for forecasting personal learning performance in VR-based construction safety training using real-time biometric responses. During VR-based safety training ('fall accidents on scaffolding'), eye-tracking and EEG data were collected in real time from 30 participants (i.e., construction workers). The main findings can be summarized as follows. Compared to the full forecast model (FM), the support vector regression algorithm of the simplified forecast model (SM), which considers only principal features as independent variables, demonstrated better prediction performance (i.e., accuracy improvement: 0.087 of mean absolute error, overfitting: one-third level of the FM). This study creates new ground in the field of personalized safety training by enabling real-time monitoring and diagnosis for the cognitive states (i.e., learning performance) of construction workers during VR-based construction safety training.

AB  - Optimizing shared resources across multiple clients is a complex challenge in the production, logistics, and service sectors. This study addresses the underexplored area of forecasting service costs for non-cooperative clients, which is essential for sustainable business management. We propose a framework that merges Operations Research (OR) and Machine Learning (ML) to fill this gap. It begins by applying the OR model to historical instances, optimizing resource allocation, and determining equitable service cost allocations for each client. These allocations serve as training targets for ML models, which are trained using a combination of original and augmented client data, aiming to reliably project service costs and support competitive, sustainable pricing strategies. The framework's efficacy is demonstrated in a reverse logistics case study, benchmarked against two traditional cost estimation methods for new clients. Comparative analysis shows that our framework outperforms these methods in terms of predictive accuracy, highlighting its superior effectiveness. The integration of OR and ML offers a significant decision-support mechanism, improving sustainable business strategies across sectors. Our framework provides a scalable solution for cost forecasting and resource optimization, marking progress toward a circular, sustainable economy by accurately estimating costs and promoting efficient operations.

AB  - Changes in heat and moisture significantly co-alter ecosystem functioning. However, knowledge on dynamics of ecosystem responses to climate change is limited. Here, we quantify long-term ecosystem sensitivity based on weighted ratios of vegetation productivity variability and multiple climate variables from satellite observations, greater values of which indicate more yields per hydrothermal condition change. Our results show ecosystem sensitivity exhibits large spatial variability and increases with the aridity index. A positive temporal trend of ecosystem sensitivity is found in 61.28% of the study area from 2001 to 2021, which is largely attributed to declining vapor pressure deficit and constrained by solar radiation. Moreover, carbon dioxide plays a dual role; which in moderation promotes fertilization effects, whereas in excess may suppress vegetation growth by triggering droughts. Our findings highlight moisture stress between land and atmosphere is one of the key prerequisites for ecosystem stability, offsetting part of the negative effects of heat.
   Terrestrial ecosystems in China have become more sensitive to declining water demand, changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, and solar radiation over the past two decades, suggests an analysis of vegetation productivity data using explainable machine learning over the period 2001-2021.

AB  - This paper presents research that integrates condition monitoring and prognostics with decision making for nuclear power plant operations and maintenance aimed at reducing lifetime maintenance and repair costs. Additionally, a focal point of this research is to make the decisions explainable to operators, improving the trustworthiness of the decisions from what can be considered a black box model. In this work, we develop and evaluate an explainable, online asset management methodology to help reduce lifetime maintenance and repair costs. Using the latest advancements in condition monitoring, inventory management, deep reinforcement learning, and explainable artificial intelligence methods, we create a predictive maintenance methodology that can optimize the maintenance and spare part management of a repairable nuclear power plant system.To demonstrate these methods, preliminary studies were conducted on a representative maintenance system undergoing a stochastic degradation process that requires repairs or replacement to continue operation. Using deep reinforcement learning, we were able to reduce maintenance spending by approximately 50% compared to optimized, time-based maintenance strategies for the chosen system. A key component of our methodology is the integration of Shapley values to quantify the contribution of various factors to the decision-making process. This addition enhances the explainability and trustworthiness of our decisions, providing operators with transparent and understandable insights into the rationale behind maintenance strategies. The robustness and resiliency of our decision policy against observation noise were also thoroughly evaluated, demonstrating its effectiveness in uncertain operational environments.

AB  - Landslides with step-like deformation features are widely distributed in the Three Gorges Reservoir area (TGR) of China, posing a severe hazard to the inhabitants of this region. This paper proposes a multi-input and multi-output intelligent integrated displacement prediction model for landslides with step-like displacement patterns. In this new model, three interconnected and information-transmitted functional sub-models are integrated. Unsupervised learning is used to identify different landslide deformation states automatically, and the imbalance classification and explainable artificial intelligence techniques are introduced for qualitative prediction and information filtering. Probability theory and deep machine learning are adopted to provide deterministically predicted values and quantify their uncertainty. The case study of the Baijiabao landslide in the TGR region proves that the proposed model performs satisfactorily in both point and interval predictions. The intelligent integrated model can also provide the forecast of landslide deformation states, visual input information filtering and back analysis of influencing factors, which are valuable to landslide early warning and risk management.

We then utilized three machine learning classifiers to determine the most accurate prediction model for predicting the mode of transportation chosen for commuting in Dhaka. Based on the predictive performance of the classifiers, we identified that the Random Forest (RF) algorithm performed the best. Using the RF model, this study also explored the relative importance of BE factors in predicting commute mode choice, identified nonlinear relationships between the BE factors and mode choice, and examined the interaction effects of these factors on mode selection. Our results reveal that, compared to socio-demographic factors, the BE substantially influence commuter travel behavior. The BE characteristics have a specific nonlinear threshold limit at which they can have a notable impact on lowering private car use, and private car use does not display a constant return of scale with BE. Their interaction effects illustrate the potential optimal combination of BE interventions to lower private car use for commuting. These findings hold substantial implications for urban environmental policy, emphasizing the need for transit-oriented development, travel demand management, and integrated land-use transportation planning to foster low-carbon transportation systems in cities like Dhaka.

AB  - Monitoring ground settlement states during tunnel boring machine (TBM) excavation in metro tunnels is crucial for construction quality and disaster prevention. However, current studies mainly focus on anomaly detection and alarm of settlement measurements, with less attention to monitoring underlying excavation influencing parameters. Moreover, these parameters commonly vary following the geological types and TBM operating states, which means if the monitor method fails to distinguish the difference in geological types and operating modes may trigger false alarms. To address above issues, an index-related operating parameters anomaly detection framework with full consideration of the multi-point distribution intrinsic property for settlement is proposed. This framework realizes adaptive monitoring across different geological types and operating modes and provides interpretability analysis for detection results through Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). Specifically, the properties of spatio-distributed settlement are firstly represented and utilized to enhance monitoring capability. Then, geological types are identified, and working condition division rules are deduced from variable effect parameters. Next, dual monitoring statistics and control limits are derived by latent variables and reconstruction errors of Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to monitor the settlement-related parameters of main mode in the most common geological type. The improved instance transfer strategy K-TrA, enhancing source-target domain similarity and reducing iteration time, is elaborated to adapt to variable working modes. Meanwhile, parameter transfer based fine-tuning strategy is adopted to monitor the main mode in other geological types. Afterward, SHapley Additive exPlanations(SHAP) is utilized to further analyze the contributions of various parameters to detection results. Finally, the performance of proposed method is verified on a real-case. Ablation and comparative experiments confirm its superiority in predictive accuracy and anomaly detection rate. Thus, our work can offer new insights for settlement monitoring and valuable guidance to field engineers.

AB  - The global attention to using timber products as sustainable construction material urges careful assessment of their performance against different hazards, particularly fire. However, the current methods prescribed by design codes for evaluating the fire resistance of timber components tend to underpredict the outcomes of standard fire resistance tests, and lack interpretability due to the use of semi-empirical equations. This study develops explainable data-driven models to predict fire resistance of timber columns using geometry- and material-related properties based on a comprehensive experimental database. Nine different single and ensemble-based machine learning algorithms were trained, and their performance was optimized through rigorous hyperparameter tuning and feature selection. The best models were then interpreted using partial dependence and Shapley plots to infer the underlying relationship between fire resistance and column properties. Lastly, the models' predictive capabilities were compared to available prescriptive equations. The results show that a random forest-based model provides the best performance with an average ratio of predicted to observed fire resistance of 1.03 on the test set. The random forest prediction is mainly governed by column capacity at ambient temperature, and to a lesser degree, columns' cross-section dimension. In addition, the partial dependence plots indicate that the effect of density, modulus of elasticity, length, and compressive strength on fire resistance was not notable. Finally, while the considered prescriptive equations consistently underpredict fire resistance, the random forest model provides a consistently accurate and balanced prediction.

AB  - Background: Arthritis is a common chronic disease among middle-aged and older adults and is strongly related to functional decline. Methods: The research sample and data were derived from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) 2015. We employed the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multifactor logistic regression analysis to identify features for model construction. We proposed six machine learning (ML) predictive models. The optimal model was selected using various learning metrics and was further interpreted using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method. Results: A total of 5111 subjects were included in the analysis, of which 1955 developed functional disability. Among the six models, XGBoost showed the best performance, achieving a test set area under the curve (AUC) of 0.74. SHAP analysis ranked the features by their contribution as follows: waist circumference, handgrip strength, self-reported health status, age, body pains, depression, history of falls, sleeping duration, and availability of care resources. SHAP dependence plots indicated that individuals over 60 with increased waist circumference (>85 cm), short sleeping duration (<5 h), and lower handgrip strength (<25 kg) had a higher probability of functional disability. Conclusion: This study presents an interpretable machine learning-based model for the early detection of functional disability in patients with arthritis and informs the development of care strategies aimed at delaying functional disability in this population.

AB  - Explainable and interpretable machine learning has emerged as essential in leveraging artificial intelligence within high-stakes domains such as healthcare to ensure transparency and trustworthiness. Feature importance analysis plays a crucial role in improving model interpretability by pinpointing the most relevant input features, particularly in disease subtyping applications, aimed at stratifying patients based on a small set of signature genes and biomarkers. While clustering methods, including unsupervised random forests, have demonstrated good performance, approaches for evaluating feature contributions in an unsupervised regime are notably scarce. To address this gap, we introduce a novel methodology to enhance the interpretability of unsupervised random forests by elucidating feature contributions through the construction of feature graphs, both over the entire dataset and individual clusters, that leverage parent-child node splits within the trees. Feature selection strategies to derive effective feature combinations from these graphs are presented and extensively evaluated on synthetic and benchmark datasets against state-of-the-art methods, standing out for performance, computational efficiency, reliability, versatility and ability to provide cluster-specific insights. In a disease subtyping application, clustering kidney cancer gene expression data over a feature subset selected with our approach reveals three patient groups with different survival outcomes. Cluster-specific analysis identifies distinctive feature contributions and interactions, essential for devising targeted interventions, conducting personalised risk assessments, and enhancing our understanding of the underlying molecular complexities.

AB  - Study region: Built-up area of Hefei City, China. Study focus: Climate change has increased frequency of extreme rainfall events. Mapping the urban flood susceptibility and exploring the impact factors can enhance urban resilience. Existing methods often treat cities as uniform entities, making it challenging to capture the complexity of these localized characteristics. This paper proposes a novel approach combining interpretable machine learning and spatial autocorrelation. An ensemble learning model assesses susceptibility by incorporating terrain, urban construction, and precipitation factors. An improved spatial weight matrix is proposed to perform spatial autocorrelation for revealing spatial distribution of flood susceptibility, and the local factors are explained by LIME to provide a fine-grained analysis of different regions. New hydrological insights for the region: (1)NDVI is the most influential factor emphasizing the importance of green spaces in urban flood regulation. (2)Micro-topography significantly affects urban flood susceptibility, and normalizing DSM based on micro-watersheds provides an accurate representation. (3)High flood susceptibility in Hefei, as revealed by spatial autocorrelation analysis, follows patterns similar to built-up areas and is influenced by major roads. Based on this, LIME analysis reveals distinct regional impact factors, such as NDVI, land use, distance to water bodies, and road density, supporting targeted flood management strategies. These findings can provide valuable insights for flood prevention and urban planning, contributing to the overall resilience of the urban environment.

AB  - Machine learning approaches (ML) based on data-driven models are conducive to accelerating the assess-ments of the martensitic transformation peak temperature (Tp) of TiZrHfNiCoCu high entropy shape memory alloys (HESMAs) over a huge composition space. In this work, an interpretable machine learning workflow was established through dataset construction, feature selection, modeling and validation, and model interpretation. We identified a set of key feature combinations closely related to Tp, by exploiting Pearson correlation selection, univariate feature selection, and forward feature elimination. The estab-lished ML model was then used to estimate the Tp of three newly synthesized alloys, with their prediction relative errors of less than 3 % in comparison with the experimental measurements. The behaviors of our ML model were interpreted by the Shapley Additive exPlainations (SHAP) approach, demonstrating the crucial role of CV22 (Allred Rochow electronegativity) in the prediction of Tp. In addition, the ML model in combination with our designed interpretation strategy was further used to investigate the effects of alloying elements on the Tp, which showed that the TiZrHfNiCoCu HESMAs with 9 <= Co (mol%) <= 10 and 15 <= Cu (mol%) <= 17 have pronounced positive effects on Tp.(c) 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Thermal comfort (TC) is a pivotal indicator of urban quality of life and influences public health, productivity, and satisfaction. This study leverages remote sensing data from 2019 to 2023 to construct a national-scale TC framework using the Modified Temperature and Humidity Index (MTHI). This analysis reveals the spatial heterogeneity of TCs across China and their key driving mechanisms. The findings show a northwest-southeast gradient in the TC, with a decreasing contrast in this direction and a north-south disparity alongside a northward shift in heat discomfort centers. High-comfort zones are found in the western plateaus, northeastern regions, and southern mountains; conversely, low-comfort zones are concentrated in the northwest, North China Plain, and southern basins, particularly in the densely urbanized eastern coastal cities and central urban clusters. Coastal areas show high internal variability, whereas inland plateaus are more stable. Natural environmental factors have emerged as the primary drivers of TC. Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) values show a continuous upward trend, underscoring the crucial role of enhanced NDVI in improving TC. Although socioeconomic factors show increased SHAP values, their adverse impacts persist as urbanization and rising building density exacerbate TC deterioration. Landscape factors exert complex effects on TC, with water body landscapes displaying an optimal regulatory range. Interactions among driving factors, characterized by direct and complex trade-offs, further modulate and intensify the effects of TC. The proposed multiscale optimization framework provides strategic insights for managing China's urban thermal environment and offers guidance for other regions with similar climate challenges.

AB  - The main objective of this paper is to use the data-driven approach to predict and evaluate the mechanical properties of concrete made with recycled concrete aggregate (RCA), including compressive strength and elastic modulus. Using 358 data samples, including 10 input variables, 10 popular machine learning (ML) algorithms are introduced to select the best ML performance model for predicting RCA concrete's compressive strength and elastic modulus. Gradient Boosting and Categorial Boosting have the best performance in predicting the compressive strength of RCA concrete, with R-2 = 0.9112, RMSE = 5.3464 MPa, MAE = 4.0845 MPa, and R-2 = 0.9175, RMSE = 5.1520 MPa, MAE = 3.7567 MPa, respectively. Light Gradient Boosting and Categorial Boosting have the best performance in predicting the elastic modulus of RCA concrete, with R-2 = 0.8775, RMSE = 2.3560 GPa, MAE = 1.8330 GPa, and R-2 = 0.9300, RMSE = 2.3560 MPa, MAE = 1.2589 MPa, respectively. Based on the Shapley Additive Explanation analysis, the influence of main factors on compressive strength and elastic modulus of RCA concrete values has been analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. RCA replacement level and cement/sand ratio slightly affect compressive strength but have a dominant influence on the elastic modulus of RCA concrete.

Developing a swift and accurate technology for identifying (K, Na)NbO3 (KNN)-based ceramic compositions with high d(33) in exceedingly large "compositional" space will establish an innovative research paradigm surpassing the traditional empirical trial-and-error method. Herein, we demonstrate an interpretable machine learning (ML) framework for quick evaluation of KNN-based ceramics with high d(33) based on data from published literature. Specifically, a thorough feature construction was carried out from the global and local dimensions to establish tree regression models with d(33) as the target property. Subsequently, the feature-property mapping rules of KNN-based piezoelectric ceramics are further optimized through feature screening. To intuitively understand the correlation mechanisms between ML regression targets and features, the sure independence screening and sparsifying operator (SISSO) method was employed to extract the essential descriptors to explain d(33). A straightforward descriptor, e(NMB-MVB)& sdot;ST/(IDA)(2), consisting of only four easily accessible parameters, can accelerate the evaluation of a series of novel KNN-based ceramics with high d(33) while exhibiting strong theoretical interpretability. This work not only provides a tool for the rapid discovery of high piezoelectric performance in KNN-based ceramics but also offers a data-driven route for the design of property descriptors in perovskites.

AB  - The inference of deep alterations plays an important role in the analysis of deep geological processes and the targeting of buried mineral resources. However, the construction of three-dimensional (3D) models of alteration zones based on geochemical data is challenging due to the diverse geological processes and scarcity of information related to deep alterations. In this paper, we propose an interpretable machine-learning method to infer 3D geological models of alteration zones based on geochemical data from the Dayingezhuang area, China. To expose the information hidden in geochemical data that is indirectly and weakly related to alteration zones, a generalized additive model (GAM) is used. It learns a nonlinear, intelligible model associating geochemical anomalies (extracted by PCA) with alteration features. The model learned via GAM and is then combined with a Bayesian framework to infer the thickness of alterations in a no-drilling area, thus enabling 3D modelling of deep alteration zones. With such an intelligible model, geologists are capable of inspecting the reliability of the model and better understanding the association between the distribution of geochemical elements and deep alterations. The inference results show that the relationship between geochemical anomalies and alteration depth is significant, while the relationship with alteration thickness is complex. The results of this study provide the underlying insights needed to guide the analysis of deep geological mineralization processes.

AB  - A hybrid intelligent framework is proposed in this paper to reduce the existing tunnel deformation caused by shield adjacent undercrossing construction (SAUC). A Bayesian optimization natural gradient boosting (BONGBoost) model for existing tunnel deformation prediction is developed, and the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) approach is used to analyze the interpretability of the prediction model. The multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) is used to optimize the construction parameters. The applicability and validity of the proposed method are tested in a case study from the Wuhan Metro. The results indicate that (1) the established BO-NGBoost existing tunnel deformation prediction model shows high accuracy. (2) Through SHAP analysis, the importance of each input parameter to the existing tunnel deformation is identified, and the key shield optimization parameters are defined. (3) By using the developed BO-NGBoost-MOEA/D algorithm to optimize the key parameters, the existing tunnel deformation is effectively controlled.

AB  - The integration of advanced computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques into collaborative robotic systems holds the potential to revolutionize human-robot interaction, productivity, and safety. Despite substantial research activity, a systematic synthesis of how vision and AI are jointly enabling context-aware, adaptive cobot capabilities across perception, planning, and decision-making remains lacking (especially in recent years). Addressing this gap, our review unifies the latest advances in visual recognition, deep learning, and semantic mapping within a structured taxonomy tailored to collaborative robotics. We examine foundational technologies such as object detection, human pose estimation, and environmental modeling, as well as emerging trends including multimodal sensor fusion, explainable AI, and ethically guided autonomy. Unlike prior surveys that focus narrowly on either vision or AI, this review uniquely analyzes their integrated use for real-world human-robot collaboration. Highlighting industrial and service applications, we distill the best practices, identify critical challenges, and present key performance metrics to guide future research. We conclude by proposing strategic directions-from scalable training methods to interoperability standards-to foster safe, robust, and proactive human-robot partnerships in the years ahead.

AB  - This review article examines recent advances in the use of machine learning for process industries. The article presents common process industry tasks that researchers are solving with machine learning techniques. It then identifies a lack of consensus among past studies when selecting an appropriate model given a prescribed application. Furthermore, the article identifies that relatively few past studies have considered model inter-pretability - a "black-box" challenge holding back machine learning's implementation in more high-risk in-dustrial applications. This interdisciplinary field of engineering and computer science is still reasonably young. Additional research is recommended to standardize methods and establish a strategic framework to manage risk during adoption of machine learning models.

AB  - The success of software projects depends on complex decision making (e.g., which tasks should a developer do first, who should perform this task, is the software of high quality, is a software system reliable and resilient enough to deploy, etc.). Bad decisions cost money (and reputation) so we need better tools for making better decisions. This article discusses the "why" and "how" of explainable and actionable software analytics. For the task of reducing the risk of software defects, we show initial results from a successful case study that offers more actionable software analytics. Also, we present an interactive tutorial on the subject of Explainable AI tools for SE in our Software Analytics Cookbook (https://xai4se.github.io/book/), and we discuss some open questions that need to be addressed.

AB  - Uncertainty quantification is a vital aspect of explainable artificial intelligence that fosters clinician trust in medical applications and facilitates timely interventions, leading to safer and more reliable outcomes. Although deep learning models have reached clinically acceptable accuracy in anatomical landmark detection, their predictions remain susceptible to contextual noise due to the small size of the target structures, making uncertainty quantification more challenging than in classification and segmentation tasks. This paper presents an end-to-end uncertainty quantification method tailored for heatmap-based anatomical landmark detection models, designed to improve both interpretability and controllability in clinical applications. Leveraging Dempster-Shafer Theory and Subjective Logic Theory, we implement probability assignment and uncertainty quantification through a single forward pass to ensure computational efficiency. We introduce an evidence map that captures the strength of landmark evidence, alongside an uncertainty map that calibrates predicted probabilities within the Subjective Logic framework. The interaction between these two components, facilitated by a cross-attention mechanism, further improves landmark detection accuracy and enhances the effectiveness of uncertainty quantification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method maintains detection accuracy, even in noisy environments, while outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of uncertainty quantification and quality control. Furthermore, the model effectively identifies out-of-distribution data solely through calibrated probabilities when encountering inconsistencies in multi-center data and novel data, underscoring its potential for clinical applications.

AB  - This research presents a novel data-driven framework for predicting the mechanical properties of waste glass aggregate concrete using six advanced metaheuristic optimization algorithms: Bat Algorithm (Bat), Cuckoo Search Algorithm (Cuckoo), Elephant Herding Optimization (Elephant), Firefly Algorithm (Firefly), Rhinoceros Optimization Algorithm (Rhino), and Gray Wolf Optimizer (Wolf). The study evaluates these models based on their ability to predict compressive strength (Fc), tensile strength (Ft), density, and slump using key statistical performance indicators such as SSE, MAE, MSE, RMSE, accuracy, R2, and KGE. Sensitivity analysis was conducted using Hoffman and Gardener's method as well as the SHAP technique to determine the most influential parameter in the prediction process. Results indicate that the Firefly and Wolf algorithms exhibited the highest prediction accuracy across all four properties, with Wolf emerging as the overall best-performing model due to its superior generalization ability, lower error rates, and high correlation with experimental results. Among the input parameters, the water-to-binder ratio was identified as the most influential factor affecting the mechanical properties of waste glass aggregate concrete, as demonstrated by both sensitivity analysis methods. This highlights the critical role of optimal water content in achieving desirable strength and workability in sustainable concrete mixtures. The study's novelty lies in the comparative assessment of multiple optimization algorithms applied to waste-based concrete, an approach that has not been extensively explored in previous research. Additionally, the integration of SHAP analysis for feature importance ranking provides an interpretable machine learning approach to concrete mix design, which enhances decision-making for engineers and researchers. The practical implications of this research extend to sustainable machine learning-based concrete design, where AI-driven optimization can help reduce the reliance on conventional trial-and-error methods. By utilizing waste glass aggregates, the study supports circular economy initiatives in construction, reducing environmental impact while maintaining structural performance. The proposed models can be implemented in real-world scenarios to optimize mix designs for large-scale applications, leading to cost-effective and eco-friendly construction materials. This research advances the field of smart construction by demonstrating the effectiveness of machine learning in sustainable material engineering, paving the way for future AI-assisted innovations in the industry.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a complementary technology in supply chain research. However, the majority of AI approaches explored in this context afford little to no explainability, which is a significant barrier to a broader adoption of AI in supply chains. In recent years, the need for explainability has been a strong impetus for research in hybrid AI methodologies that combine neural architectures with logic-based reasoning, which are collectively referred to as Neurosymbolic AI. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of supply chain management literature that employs approaches within the neurosymbolic AI spectrum. To that end, a systematic review is conducted, followed by bibliometric, descriptive and thematic analyses on the identified studies. Our findings indicate that researchers have primarily focused on the limited subset of neurofuzzy approaches, while some supply chain applications, such as performance evaluation and sustainability, and sectors such as pharmaceutical and construction have received less attention. To help address these gaps, we propose five pillars of neurosymbolic AI research for supply chains and provide four use cases of applying unexplored neurosymbolic AI approaches to address typical problems in supply chain management, including a discussion of prerequisites for adopting such technologies. We envision that the findings and contributions of this survey will help encourage further research in neurosymbolic AI for supply chains and increase adoption of such technologies within supply chain practice.

AB  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have become a common choice for industrial quality control, as well as other critical applications in the Industry 4.0. When these CNNs behave in ways unexpected to human users or developers, severe consequences can arise, such as economic losses or an increased risk to human life. Concept extraction techniques can be applied to increase the reliability and transparency of CNNs through generating global explanations for trained neural network models. The decisive features of image datasets in quality control often depend on the feature's scale; for example, the size of a hole or an edge. However, existing concept extraction methods do not correctly represent scale, which leads to problems interpreting these models as we show herein. To address this issue, we introduce the Scale-Preserving Automatic Concept Extraction (SPACE) algorithm, as a state-of-the-art alternative concept extraction technique for CNNs, focused on industrial applications. SPACE is specifically designed to overcome the aforementioned problems by avoiding scale changes throughout the concept extraction process. SPACE proposes an approach based on square slices of input images, which are selected and then tiled before being clustered into concepts. Our method provides explanations of the models' decision-making process in the form of human-understandable concepts. We evaluate SPACE on three image classification datasets in the context of industrial quality control. Through experimental results, we illustrate how SPACE outperforms other methods and provides actionable insights on the decision mechanisms of CNNs. Finally, code for the implementation of SPACE is provided.

AB  - The progress in the field of Machine Learning (ML) has enabled the automation of tasks that were considered impossible to program until recently. These advancements today have incited firms to seek intelligent solutions as part of their enterprise software stack. Even governments across the globe are motivating firms through policies to tape into ML arena as it promises opportunities for growth, productivity and efficiency. In reflex, many firms embark on ML without knowing what it entails. The outcomes so far are not as expected because the ML, as hyped by tech firms, is not the silver bullet. However, whatever ML offers, firms urge to capitalise it for their competitive advantage. Applying ML to real-life construction industry problems goes beyond just prototyping predictive models. It entails intensive activities which, in addition to training robust ML models, provides a comprehensive framework for answering questions asked by construction folks when intelligent solutions are getting deployed at their premises to substitute or facilitate their decision-making tasks. Existing ML guidelines used in the IT industry are vastly restricted to training ML models. This paper presents guidelines for Applied Machine Learning (AML) in the construction industry from training to operationalising models, which are drawn from our experience of working with construction folks to deliver Construction Simulation Tool (CST). The unique aspect of these guidelines lies not only in providing a novel framework for training models but also answering critical questions related to model confidence, trust, interpretability, bias, feature importance and model extrapolation capabilities. Generally, ML models are presumed black boxes; hence argued that nobody knows what a model learns and how it generates predictions. Even very few ML folks barely know approaches to answer questions asked by the end users. Without explaining the competence of ML, the broader adoption of intelligent solutions in the construction industry cannot be attained. This paper proposed a detailed process for AML to develop intelligent solutions in the construction industry. Most discussions in the study are elaborated in the context of profit margin estimation for new projects.

AB  - Analysing the interpretability of a fuzzy system (either hierarchical or not) involves consideration of its semantic properties and evaluation of its structural complexity. The present paper concentrates on the semantic aspects of interpretability in hierarchical fuzzy systems. Complexity reduction is also considered, but from the perspective of its interaction with semantic preservation. In that sense, the paper shows that only the use of intermediate variables with meaning (interpretable variables) will transform the complexity reduction into a real improvement in interpretability. The paper formalises this idea by introducing the concept of semantically decouplable hierarchies. Under the assumption of semantic decouplability, it is shown that the interpretability of the overall hierarchical system can be directly obtained from that of its subsystems. Consequently, the paper defines and measures the interpretability of a semantically decouplable hierarchical fuzzy system as the aggregation of the interpretability of its subsystems. Finally, several options will be considered for this aggregation process. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Currently, there are limited mechanisms to control harmful greenhouse gas emissions. There is a need to contain these emissions at the source level; understanding the root cause is imperative. This would aid in monitoring and curbing those factors to minimize these harmful emissions and control incidences of energy risk. While there are studies evidencing the role of generic indicators like per capita carbon consumption on greenhouse gas levels, these are also equally influenced by climatic risk factors such as surface temperature. Research suggests that climatic factors significantly impact fluctuating greenhouse gas emissions. However, existing studies have not quantified the precise extent to which these factors drive harmful emissions, which, in turn, also curb energy efficiency and increase the costs of generation of energy alternatives. To address this gap, the outcome variable 'Total greenhouse gas emissions including land-use change and forestry' is examined using advanced machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Multi-layer perceptron models and Deep Neural Networks. Algorithms are chosen in the hierarchical order of accuracy to capture the differential capabilities of detecting the causation factors of harmful emissions. While the above algorithms see the essential features in terms of absolute value, there is a need to examine how each factor contributes to the emissions relative to the others. The Shapley framework of Explainable AI is therefore employed to scientifically assess the influence of different factors on consumption levels. The outcomes of the Shapley analysis are then validated through regression and further supported by the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). The research also proposes adopting association rule mining to analyze the co-occurrence of specific climatic conditions on energy consumption. The findings of this study offer valuable insights for both society and experts in climate and energy, enabling them to develop specific strategies and targeted climatic policies for effective energy risk management. This would present an opportunity for economic transformation, job creation, technological advancement, and improved environmental and public health outcomes. While initial costs and challenges may be associated with a transition, the long-term benefits would help attain sustainable energy economics.

AB  - Recreational micromobility exhibits characteristics of sustainable travel behavior and recreational activities, offering fresh perspectives for landscape and urban studies. The 5D framework of the built environment Density, Diversity, Design, Destination Accessibility, and Distance to Transit - are thus often used to examine their influence on recreational micromobility. However, the relationships between recreational micromobility, historic urban areas as a distinct type of built environment, and the shaping role of social media remain underexplored. To address this research gap, we first integrate 5D, History and Cultural Heritage (H), and Social Media (S) dimensions to develop an innovative HS-5D framework to guide the exploration of recreational micromobility. Then, we conduct a Guangzhou (China) case study using seven machine learning models with large-volume GPS trajectories and multisource data. Our findings highlight that (1) the HS-5D framework has 10% higher explanatory power than the traditional 5D framework when examined by the Light Gradient Boosting Machine model with the Bayesian optimization algorithm; (2) among all dimensions, the Destination Accessibility has the most significant impact on recreational micromobility, followed by the Social Media and the Historical and Cultural Heritage; (3) the Density and Diversity dimensions have a negative impact on recreational micromobility; (4) when a place has a low rating in social media, high accessibility tends to decrease recreation micromobility of individuals. Our study provides insights into understanding the complex relationships between recreational micromobility, historic urban areas and social media better and helps develop strategies that improve the quality of urban life in a sustainable manner.

AB  - As electric bikes (e-bikes) rapidly develop in China, their traffic safety issues are becoming increasingly prominent. Accurately detecting risky riding behaviors and conducting mechanism analysis on the multiple risk factors are crucial in formulating and implementing precise management policies. The emergence of shared ebikes and the advancements in interpretable machine learning present new opportunities for accurately analyzing the determinants of risky riding behaviors. The primary objective of this study is to examine and analyze the risk factors related to speeding behavior to aid urban management agencies in crafting necessary management policies. This study utilizes a large-scale dataset of shared e-bike trajectory data to establish a framework for detecting speeding behavior. Subsequently, the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model is employed to identify the level of speeding risk by leveraging its excellent identification ability. Moreover, based on measuring the degree of interaction among road, traffic, and weather characteristics, the investigation of the complex interactive effects of these risk factors on high-risk speeding is conducted using bivariate partial dependence plots (PDP) by its superior parsing ability. Feature importance analysis results indicate that the top five ranked variables that significantly affect the identified results of speed risk levels are land use density, rainfall, road level, curbside parking density, and bike lane width. The interaction analysis results indicate that higher levels of road and bike lane width correspond to an increased possibility of high-risk speeding among riders. Land use density, curbside parking density, and rainfall display a nonlinear effect on high-risk speeding. Introducing road level, bike lane width, and time interval could change the patterns of nonlinear effects in land use density, curbside parking density, and rainfall. Finally, several policy recommendations are proposed to improve e-bike traffic safety by utilizing the extracted feature values associated with a higher probability of high- risk speeding.

AB  - Understanding intra-urban travel patterns through quantitative analysis is crucial for effective urban planning and transportation management. In previous studies, a range of distribution functions were modeled to lay the groundwork for human mobility research. However, few studies have explored the nonlinear relationships between travel distance patterns and environmental factors. Using travel distance data from ride-hailing services, this research divides a study area into 1 x 1 km grid cells, modeling the best travel distance distribution and calculating the coefficients of each grid. A machine learning framework (Extreme Gradient Boosting combined with Shapley Additive Explanations) is introduced to interpret the factors influencing these distributions. Our results emphasize that the travel distance of human movement tends to follow a log-normal distribution and exhibits spatial heterogeneity. Key factors affecting travel distance distributions include the distance to the city center, bus station density, land use entropy, and the density of companies. Most environmental variables exhibit nonlinear and threshold effects on the log-normal distribution coefficients. These findings significantly advance our understanding of ride-hailing travel patterns and offer valuable insights into the spatial dynamics of human mobility.

AB  - Many global high-density cities have embraced transit-oriented development (TOD) strategies around metro stations in a strong push toward promoting transit trips. However, the general TOD principles must be adapted to a variety of local features. Thus, conducting a baseline study that deciphers the locality-specific differences and similarities in the influence of TOD on metro ridership is of paramount importance. Using the case of Shanghai in China, this paper demonstrated a novel approach to unveiling the locality-specific influence of TOD on metro ridership that integrated the node-functionality-place model with interpretable machine learning. By exploring a wide range of explanatory variables, we discovered that the relative importance of TOD structural factors (e.g., node, place and functionality) and neighborhood sociodemographics as well as their interactions presented great spatial and temporal heterogeneity for boarding and alighting on weekdays and weekends. Among the TOD structural factors, functionality was of the highest importance, and a greater contribution was observed within the central districts during peak hours. Regarding the interactions among the TOD structural factors, the interaction between node and functionality presented the highest relative importance, followed by that between place between functionality and that between node and place. Additionally, neighborhood sociodemographics also accounted for a noticeable contribution, especially in the outskirts. Based on the locality-specific estima-tions, the affinity propagation clustering algorithm was further used to cluster the TODs into difference groups as nuanced representations of the TOD-metro ridership relationships. The findings refreshed the knowledge base concerning the spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the nonlinear influence of TOD on metro ridership and provided new insights into spatial planning. The proposed approach showed high computational feasibility with strong theoretical underpinnings and thus offered broad potential applications into other high-density cities worldwide.

AB  - Photosynthetic efficiency (PE) quantifies the fraction of absorbed light used in photochemistry to produce chemical energy during photosynthesis and is essential for understanding ecosystem productivity and the global carbon cycle, particularly under conditions of vegetation stress. However, nearly 60% of the global spatiotemporal variance in terrestrial PE remains unexplained. Here we integrate remote sensing and eco-evolutionary optimality theory to derive key plant traits, alongside explainable machine learning and global eddy covariance observations, to uncover the drivers of daily PE variations. Incorporating plant traits into our model increases the explained daily PE variance from 36% to 80% for C3 vegetation and from 54% to 84% for C4 vegetation compared with using climate data alone. Key plant traits-including chlorophyll content, leaf longevity and leaf mass per area-consistently emerge as important factors across global biomes and temporal scales. Water availability and light conditions are also critical in regulating PE, underscoring the need for an integrative approach that combines plant traits with climatic factors. Overall, our findings demonstrate the potential of remote sensing and eco-evolutionary optimality theory to capture principal PE drivers, offering valuable tools for more accurately predicting ecosystem productivity and improving Earth system models under climate change.

AB  - Joint cost management is a decisive factor for sustainable collaboration in supplier-buyer dyads. For both parties the establishment of an accurate cost estimation (CE) framework supports managing suppliers' costs as well as manufacturer's quotation costing. Grounded on resource dependence theory and following a design science research approach, this study introduces a multi-perspective CE system inspired by statistical learning, deep learning, decision making, and multi-agent theory. We evaluate our system by a single case and computer simulation study, using empirical data coming from observations and archives at a large Bavarian original equipment manufacturer (OEM). The results indicate that our CE approach allows to select the most significant cost-drivers and predict total costs of parts and assemblies with high accuracy. This supports the supplier in efficiently managing its costs. In making the CE blackbox model transparent using a combination of model agnostic post-hoc explainable artificial intelligence approaches we foster user acceptance for both suppliers and OEMs. All CE artifacts are ensembled in a multi-agent system to automatically manage costs with suppliers and furthermore, as a model extension, can lead to a collaborative price agreement. Our system supports supply chain managers on both sides in entering into a sustainable long partnership.

AB  - Fatigue poses significant risks to safety, productivity, and overall well-being. Traditional statistical methods have been employed for inferring fatigue-related patterns; however, there is a need for interpretable machine learning approaches that integrate time series prediction capabilities to develop intelligent health systems for fatigue management. This study explored forecasting perception and performance scores associated with fatigue using cardiac activity and heart rate variability (HRV), employing both generalized and personalized models with a 10-minute forecast interval during a cognitively fatiguing task. Participants underwent a two-hour working memory task while providing subjective fatigue responses every 10 min, serving as perception labels, and their performance within each 10-minute interval was quantified as their performance labels. The results revealed that performance-labeled models generated lower mean absolute errors compared to perception-labeled models, while the Gradient Boosting Regression algorithm achieved the lowest mean absolute error in forecasting performance scores due to fatigue for both generalized and personalized models. Sample entropy, ratio of Standard Deviation-Poincar & eacute;, the proportion of peak-to-peak intervals over 50 ms, coefficient of variation of peak-to-peak intervals, and low frequency were the most important features for predicting performance. These findings offer the potential to forecast performance decline resulting from fatigue in working memory tasks, facilitating the implementation of fatigue mitigation interventions to reduce injury risks and performance impairments. The integration of interpretable machine learning methods with time series forecasting provides valuable insights for developing intelligent systems that proactively manage fatigue and optimize performance across various domains.

AB  - Recently, ensemble-based machine learning models have been widely used and have demonstrated their efficiency in bankruptcy prediction. However, these algorithms are black box models and people cannot understand why they make their forecasts. This explains why interpretability methods in machine learning attract attention from many artificial intelligence researchers. In this paper, we evaluate the prediction performance of Random Forest, LightGBM, XGBoost, and NGBoost (Natural Gradient Boosting for probabilistic prediction) for French firms from different industries with the horizon of 1-5 years. We then use Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), a model-agnostic method to explain XGBoost, one of the best models for our data. SHAP can show how each feature impacts the output from XGBoost. Furthermore, single prediction can also be explained, thus allowing black box models to be used in credit risk management.

AB  - The accurate assessment of tsunami-induced damage to coastal roads is crucial for effective disaster risk management. Traditional approaches, reliant on univariate fragility functions, often fail to capture the complex interplay of variables influencing road damage during tsunami events. This study addresses this limitation by employing machine learning techniques on an extensive dataset compiled after the 2011 Great East Japan tsunami. The dataset, enriched with additional explicative variables accounting for the hydraulic features of the event and the physical characteristics at roads' location, enables a comprehensive analysis of road damage mechanisms. Results indicate that while inundation depth remains a significant predictor, factors such as wave approach angle, road orientation and potential overflow from inland watercourses also play critical roles.

AB  - Background: Monitoring intrinsic capacity and implementing appropriate interventions can support healthy aging. There are, though, few tools available for predicting decline in intrinsic capacity among older adults. This study aimed to develop and validate an interpretable machine learning model designed to identify populations at elevated risk of a decline in intrinsic capacity. Methods: Using data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study baseline (2011) and 4-year follow-up (2015), a total of 822 participants were randomly allocated to a training set and a testing set at a 7:3 ratio. Five machine learning methods were employed to train the model and assess its performance through various metrics. The SHapley Additive exPlanation method was subsequently used to interpret the optimal model. Results: The 4-year incidence of decline in intrinsic capacity among the older adults in the sample was 44.6 % (n = 367). Nine variables were screened for model construction, among which eXtreme gradient boosting demonstrated the best predictive performance, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.715 (95 % CI 0.651-0.780) in the testing set. The SHapley Additive exPlanation method identified educational level, smoking, handgrip strength, self-rated health, and residence as the top five significant predictors. Conclusions: The developed model can serve as a highly effective tool for primary care teams to identify older adults with early signs of decline in intrinsic capacity, facilitating the provision of subsequent screening and tailored interventions for intrinsic capacity.

AB  - The in-situ material shortage and high geothermal service conditions significantly hinder the utilization of shotcrete for the construction of tunnels in plateau regions. In this study, fully tunnel muck-based shotcrete (FTMS) was developed using stone powder and sand-gravel aggregates derived from tunnel muck. The effects of stone powder content, stone powder modification methods, and six performance-reinforcing materials on the high-geothermal resistance of FTMS were systematically investigated. The results demonstrated that a stone powder content of 20 % and a modification ratio of stone powder:silica fume:modifier = 82:15:3 achieved an optimal balance between stone powder utilization and high-geothermal performance. The improvement effect of calcium carbonate whiskers on the compressive strength of FTMS under high geothermal conditions was most significant, while the optimization effect of nano alumina sol on compressive strength and mass loss rate was most prominent. The influence of dual-doped performance-reinforcing materials on three properties was predicted using artificial neural networks, and interpretability analysis was conducted using SHAP. Finally, the optimal combination strategy was determined to be the co-doping of nano alumina sol and calcium carbonate whiskers. Microstructural analysis revealed that the addition of nanomaterials forms a dense calcium carbonate network in FTMS, while promoting the secondary hydration of calcium hydroxide, resulting in high-strength hydration products such as monocarboaluminate and ettringite. Additionally, a significant transformation of C-S-H to C-A-S-H phases was observed, accompanied by a 36.6 % reduction in harmful pores.

AB  - Fermented golden pomfret (Trachinotus ovatus) is appreciated by local consumers owing to its distinct flavor. Electronic nose (E-nose) and gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS) technologies were used to analyze the changes in volatile compounds responsible for evolution of the golden pomfret odor profile during fermentation. Forty-five ion peaks were detected using GC-IMS. Although aldehydes represented the major initial volatile compound group, their levels decreased as fermentation proceeded. Between 3 and 15 days, increased levels of esters contributed to a stable volatile organic compounds profile. After 18 days, high levels of indole and pyrazines were detected. Eleven key volatile compounds were screened based on partial least squares discrim-inant analysis (PLS-DA). Back propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN) predicted the fermentation stage enabling the development of better strategies to regulate golden pomfret fermentation. This study provided a theoretical basis for real-time monitoring and quality control of Chinese fermented golden pomfet.

AB  - Constructing interpretable machine learning models that are able to explain the result of the inference process is an important factor to increase the level of confidence and trust in the machine learning models and their results, especially in medicine. Fuzzy classifiers are interpretable in nature because they consist of IF-THEN rules and use fuzzy terms used in colloquial speech. For the construction of fuzzy classifiers, the authors use a three-stage construction method consisting of a structure generation stage, a feature selection stage, and a rule parameter optimization stage. This paper focuses on the feature selection stage. At this stage, swallow swarm and leaping frogs binary metaheuristic algorithms are used for feature selection by wrapper method. Various implementations of binarization algorithms are proposed to convert the search space from continuous to discrete. Experiments on classifier construction and statistical evaluation of the effectiveness of the resulting models were performed, which showed a significant advantage in feature reduction compared to genetic fuzzy systems.

AB  - Non-destructive concrete strength prediction faces limitations in validation scope, methodological comparison, and interpretability that constrain deployment in safety-critical construction applications. This study presents a machine learning framework integrating polynomial feature engineering, AdaBoost ensemble regression, and Bayesian optimization to achieve both predictive accuracy and physics-consistent interpretability. Eight state-of-the-art methods were evaluated across 4420 concrete samples, including statistical significance testing, scenario-based assessment, and robustness analysis under measurement uncertainty. The proposed PolyBayes-ABR methodology achieves R-2 = 0.9957 (RMSE = 0.643 MPa), showing statistical equivalence to leading ensemble methods, including XGBoost (p = 0.734) and Random Forest (p = 0.888), while outperforming traditional approaches (p < 0.001). Scenario-based validation across four engineering applications confirms robust performance (R-2 > 0.93 in all cases). SHAP analysis reveals that polynomial features capture physics-consistent interactions, with the Curing_age x Er interaction achieving dominant importance (SHAP value: 4.2337), aligning with established hydration-microstructure relationships. When accuracy differences fall within measurement uncertainty ranges, the framework provides practical advantages through enhanced uncertainty quantification (+/- 1.260 MPa vs. +/- 1.338 MPa baseline) and actionable engineering insights for quality control and mix design optimization. This approach addresses the interpretability challenge in concrete engineering applications where both predictive performance and scientific understanding are essential for safe deployment.

AB  - While Artificial intelligence (AI) has been successfully applied in assessing geotechnical risk, such methods heavily rely on data quality to achieve satisfactory performance, and their results hardly can be interpreted due to their opaque design. With this in mind, this paper aims to address the following research gap: How can we accurately model geotechnical risks using limited data and domain knowledge, and efficiently explain the results of AI model? We develop a physics-guided transfer learning (PGTL) model to enhance the explainability and accuracy of geotechnical risk modeling. With the help of a physical model that simulates the tunnel excavation, a physicsguided dataset with 1000 samples is established and used to train a deep neural network. On these bases, transfer learning is adopted to fuse the features of physics mechanisms and monitoring data, constructing an explainable prediction model of geotechnical risk. To further support risk decision-making, feature relevance techniques are employed to assess the contribution of input parameters to risk. A shield tunnel construction in Wuhan is selected as a case to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The PGTL exhibits a more promising accuracy with R2 of 0.777 in contrast to three popular machine learning approaches, and provides insights into parameters that significantly induce risk, enhancing site managers' understanding of tunnel construction and being conducive to tunnel safety.

AB  - Walking plays a critical role in promoting healthier and more sustainable cities, yet its environmental determinants are often examined without considering three-dimensional urban morphology. This study introduces a morphology-sensitive framework based on the Local Climate Zone (LCZ) classification to evaluate how built environment, climate, and air pollution factors jointly influence walking across distinct urban forms. Urban morphology is operationalized as a combination of building height and density, defined by the LCZ framework. Using large-scale walking trajectory data from Shenzhen, China, we applied Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) with SHAPley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to identify key environmental factors at the citywide scale and across seven LCZ-defined morphological types. Results reveal that environmental influences on walking vary significantly by urban morphology. In low-rise zones, walking is supported by transit access and walkability features, while natural environments such as NDVI and proximity to water play a minor role; air pollution increasingly constrains walking in high-density settings. Mid-rise medium-density zones present a transitional condition, where transit access, walkability features, and natural environments contribute positively, yet moderate suppression from air pollution and heat occurs. In contrast, high-rise areas experience strong compounded suppression from both air pollution and heat, while the benefits of green infrastructure become increasingly marginal. These findings challenge the assumption of spatial uniformity in environment-walking relationships and highlight the moderating role of urban morphology. By integrating LCZ classification with interpretable machine learning, this study offers a novel approach to identify formspecific environmental constraints on walking, providing actionable insights for climateadaptive urban design.

AB  - This study aims to develop a new artificial intelligence model that can produce explainable rules to predict the mix design and early-age concrete compressive strength classes of recycled aggregate concrete (RAC). Unlike other black-box machine learning methods and rule-based algorithms, the study relies on a metaheuristic mechanism for explainability. This metaheuristic mechanism is not used for a traditional parameter optimization, but to automatically extract interpretable and interpretable rules from the experimental data. In the study, 30 series of RACs are produced, and the samples' 1- and 3-day early-age concrete compressive strength values are determined. Concretes produced using these strength values are classified. The labels defined for each concrete class are Class A (C 8/10), Class B (C 12/15), Class C (C 16/20), and Class D (C 20/25). The proposed intelligent classification model that consists of rule set automatically produces interpretable and comprehensible rules from data to determine the early-age concrete compressive strength class and RAC mix amounts. In addition, the proposed method eliminates the black-box disadvantages of classical machine learning methods with its explainability and interpretability feature. The sunflower optimization algorithm is adapted as the metaheuristic mechanism and a special fitness function and representative solution form are developed for automatic extraction of high-quality comprehensible rules by simultaneously optimizing many different metrics. This paper is the first interpretable and comprehensible artificial intelligence model attempt used for early-age compressive strength classification and mixture design of recycled aggregate concrete by balancing and optimizing both the accuracy and explainability. Proposed explainable intelligent classification model is tested against both well-known state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms and standard rule-based methods on the produced real data. Promising results in terms of accuracy, precision, recall are obtained along with the explainability feature.

AB  - This study aims to develop a reliable method for predicting power plant construction costs during the early planning stages using ensemble machine learning techniques. Accurate cost predictions are essential for project feasibility, and this research highlights the strength of ensemble methods in improving prediction accuracy by combining the advantages of multiple models, offering a significant improvement over traditional approaches. This investigation employed the Random Forest (RF) algorithm to estimate the overall construction cost of a power plant. The RF algorithm was contrasted with single-learner machine learning models: Support Vector Regression (SVR) and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Performance measures, comprising the coefficient of determination (R2), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), were used to evaluate and contrast the performance of the implemented models. Statistical measures demonstrated that the RF approach surpassed alternative models, demonstrating the highest coefficient of determination for testing (R2=0.956) and the lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE = 29.27) for the testing dataset. The Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) technique was implemented to explain the significance and impact of predictor factors affecting power plant construction costs. The outcomes of this investigation provide crucial information for project decision-makers, allowing them to reduce discrepancies in projected costs and make informed decisions at the beginning of the construction phase.

AB  - Objective Pulmonary infection (PI) remains a prevalent and severe complication in patients recovering from spontaneous deep subcortical intracerebral hemorrhage (deep SICH). Accurate prediction of PI risk is crucial for early intervention and optimized clinical management. The aim of this study was to develop a machine learning (ML) model for predicting PI risk in patients during the recovery phase of deep SICH and to investigate the contributions of individual risk factors through explainable artificial intelligence techniques.Methods We conducted a retrospective study involving 649 patients diagnosed with PI during the recovery phase of deep SICH between 2021 and 2023. The cohort was divided into a training set (70%, n = 454) and a testing set (30%, n = 195). Eight key clinical features were identified using the Boruta algorithm: mechanical ventilation, nasogastric feeding, tracheotomy, antibacterial drug use, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, procalcitonin levels, sedative drug use, and consciousness scores. Seven ML algorithms were employed to build predictive models, with performance evaluated based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curve, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. The best-performing model was selected, and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) analysis was performed to interpret feature importance.Results Among 649 patients with deep SICH, no significant baseline differences were found between the training (n = 454) and testing (n = 195) sets. The Boruta algorithm identified eight key predictors of pulmonary infection (PI). The random forest (RF) model achieved the highest AUCs: 0.994 (95% CI: 0.989-0.998) in training and 0.931 (95% CI: 0.899-0.963) in testing. DeLong tests showed RF significantly outperformed several models (DT, SVM, LightGBM), while performance differences with XGBoost (p = 0.95), KNN (p = 0.80), and LR (p = 0.22) were not significant. SHAP analysis revealed mechanical ventilation, nasogastric feeding, and tracheotomy as key risk factors, with hyperbaric oxygen therapy and higher consciousness scores showing protective effects.Conclusions This study provides a high-performing and interpretable ML-based risk stratification tool for pulmonary infection in patients during the recovery phase of deep SICH. The integration of SHAP enhances clinical applicability by demystifying complex model outputs, thereby supporting individualized preventive strategies. These findings underscore the promise of explainable AI in advancing neurocritical care and call for prospective multicenter validation and real-time dynamic model adaptation in future research.

AB  - Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) can result in deleterious consequences when patients take multiple medications simultaneously, emphasizing the critical need for accurate DDI prediction. Computational methods for DDI prediction have garnered recent attention. However, current approaches concentrate solely on single-view features, such as atomic-view or substructure-view features, limiting predictive capacity. The scarcity of research on interpretability studies based on multi-view features is crucial for tracing interactions. Addressing this gap, we present MI-DDI, a multi-view feature-based interpretable deep learning framework for DDI. To fully extract multi-view features, we employ a Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) to learn atomic features from molecular graphs generated by RDkit, and transformer encoders are used to learn substructure-view embeddings from drug SMILES simultaneously. These atomic-view and substructure-view features are then amalgamated into a holistic drug embedding matrix. Subsequently, an intricately designed interaction module not only establishes a tractable path for understanding interactions but also directly informs the construction of weight matrices, enabling precise and interpretable interaction predictions. Validation on the BIOSNAP dataset and DrugBank dataset demonstrates MI-DDI's superiority. It surpasses the current benchmarks by a substantial average of 3% on BIOSNAP and 1% on DrugBank. Additional experiments underscore the significance of atomic-view information for DDI prediction and confirm that our interaction module indeed learns more effective information for DDI prediction.

AB  - The complex, randomly distributed pores in ceramics cause significant variability in fracture strength, limiting reliable applications. This study proposes an intelligent method for quantitative strength prediction of Si3N4 ceramics, achieving a validation error of similar to 2 %. The excellent predictive performance of the model was partly attributed to the precise extraction of pore size, shape, orientation, and location obtained through nano-CT technology. Additionally, the construction of a scientific feature space (based on correlation analysis and recursive elimination methods) enabled the optimal construction of strength prediction models based on XGBoost and AdaBoost algorithms from 9 classic machine learning algorithms. More importantly, the model comprehensively integrated the inherent properties of the material and pore feature information, realized through hyperparameter tuning, region-based pore screening, and consideration of critical flaw characteristics of the material. Interpretable machine learning (SHAP, PDP and ICE), non-destructive testing, and fracture analysis results were also used for descriptor extraction and model analysis.

AB  - The growing interest in the financial materiality of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) ratings has prompted recent investigations into their risk pricing impact in the corporate bond market. The specific implications for the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry have not been explored, as prior work has primarily focused on broad-based ESG integration. To fill this gap, our study employed an interpretable machine learning technique using a sample universe of U.S. corporate bonds spanning from 2010 to 2021 to estimate the impact of ESG ratings on corporate bond issuance spreads. The results revealed an average ESG benefit of 10 basis points across all sectors. However, it is important to note that the effects of ESG ratings on bond pricing demonstrate variation across sectors and individual ESG constituent ratings. Significantly, our findings show that social and governance ratings emerge as the primary drivers influencing bond issuance costs, whereas the impact of environmental scores is comparatively less significant. Within AEC-related industries, empirical data on the influence of ESG ratings indicate discounted pricing by the market is particularly channeled through environmental and governance scores. These findings emphasize the value-added impact of enhanced ESG performance on the cost of debt financing, presenting a financially material opportunity for operational and management decision-making. By adopting sustainable strategies to improve ESG performance, organizations in the AEC industry can potentially achieve lower costs of debt when issuing bonds to secure financing for construction projects. The managerial implications extend to policymakers, corporate managers, and creditors, as they all stand to benefit from the financial implications of ESG performance.

AB  - Recycling waste glass (WG) can be time-consuming, costly, and impractical. However, its incorporation into concrete significantly reduces environmental impact and carbon emissions. This paper introduces machine learning (ML) to civil engineering to optimise WG utilisation in concrete, supporting sustainability objectives. By employing a dataset of 471 experimental samples of waste glass concrete (WGC), various ML algorithms are applied, including Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Deep Neural Network (DNN), and k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN), to predict properties containing compressive strength (CS), alkali-silica reaction (ASR), and saved carbon credits (SCC). The proposed models achieve outstanding prediction performance with Coefficient of determination (R2) values of 0.95 for CS, 0.97 for ASR, and 0.99 for SCC using GBR and SVR, demonstrating high prediction accuracy with Root mean square error (RMSE) values of 3.31 MPa for CS, 0.03 % for ASR, and 0.11 for SCC. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis is utilised to interpret the model results, ensuring transparency and interpretability of the proposed ML models. The results reveal that the incorporation level of WG is a more significant influencing factor for these properties than the mean size of WG (MSWG).

AB  - AI and machine learning have made significant progress in the past decade, powering many applications in FinTech and beyond. But few machine learning models, especially deep learning models, are interpretable by humans, creating challenges for risk management and model improvements. Here, we propose a simple yet powerful framework to evaluate and interpret any black-box model with binary outcomes and explanatory variables, and heterogeneous relationships between the two. Our new metric, the signal success share (SSS) cross-entropy loss, measures how well the model captures the relationship along any feature or dimension, thereby providing actionable guidance on model improvements. Simulations demonstrate that our metric works for heterogeneous and nonlinear predictions, and distinguishes itself from traditional loss functions in evaluating model interpretability. We apply the methodology to an example of predicting loan defaults with real data. Our framework is more broadly applicable to a wide range of problems in financial and information technology.

AB  - BackgroundThe incidence and mortality of cardiac arrest (CA) is high. We developed interpretable machine learning models for early prediction of ICU mortality risk in patients diagnosed with CA.MethodsData from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV, version 2.2) was randomized to training set (0.7) and internal validation set (0.3), and data from eICU(version 2.0.1) was used as external validation set. Five models including Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), and Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) were developed. The model with the largest area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and good performance in other features was defined as the best model, and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) was used to improve the interpretability of the optimal model.ResultsA total of 1088 patients from MIMIC-IV, and 3542 patients from eICU were included. Seven variables were selected to construct models by Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression. The RF model was the best predictive model with AUC and 95% CI at 0.83 (0.78-0.88) in internal validation set, and 0.71(0.68-0.74) in external validation set. SHAP analysis found that the variables that had a high impact on the risk of ICU death were minimal Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), base excess, anion gap, and urine output.ConclusionRF is the optimal model for predicting the risk of ICU death in CA patients. The development of this model is important for early identification and intervention of CA patients who are at risk of dying in the ICU.

T2  - PLOS ONE

AB  - Background Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common nosocomial infection in ICU, significantly associated with poor outcomes. However, there is currently a lack of reliable and interpretable tools for assessing the risk of in-hospital mortality in VAP patients. This study aims to develop an interpretable machine learning (ML) prediction model to enhance the assessment of in-hospital mortality risk in VAP patients.Methods This study extracted VAP patient data from versions 2.2 and 3.1 of the MIMIC-IV database, using version 2.2 for model training and validation, and version 3.1 for external testing. Feature selection was conducted using the Boruta algorithm, and 14 ML models were constructed. The optimal model was identified based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity across both validation and test cohorts. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis was applied for global and local interpretability.Results A total of 1,894 VAP patients were included, with 12 features ultimately selected for model construction: 24-hour urine output, blood urea nitrogen, age, diastolic blood pressure, platelet count, anion gap, body temperature, bicarbonate level, sodium level, body mass index, and whether combined with congestive heart failure and cerebrovascular disease. The random forest (RF) model showed the best performance, achieving an AUC of 0.780 in internal validation and 0.724 in external testing, outperforming other ML models and common clinical scoring systems.Conclusion The RF model demonstrated robust and reliable performance in predicting in-hospital mortality risk for VAP patients. The developed online tool can assist clinicians in efficiently assessing VAP in-hospital mortality risk, supporting clinical decision-making.

AB  - Reservoir operations have complex and profound impacts on local climate, particularly precipitation. Quantifying this impact is challenging because it requires the reconstruction of natural precipitation prior to reservoir operation. Instead of assuming that the natural variability of the contrast region and the study region is identical, this study develops an interpretable machine learning model to investigate relationships between precipitation-influencing factors and precipitation itself, including both stable components (sum of trend and seasonality from STL decomposition) and random components (residuals after removing trend and seasonality), which is then used to forecast natural precipitation in the absence of reservoir operation. The application in the contrast region verifies the forecast's accuracy, even in mountainous areas. The proposed method is used to analyze the impact of three large-scale reservoirs along the Yangtze River on local precipitation, collectively having a total storage capacity of 17.86 x 109 m3. The results indicate that reservoir operation leads to a 14% increase in the trend and seasonal components of precipitation, which would be underestimated by previous methods. In addition, there is a noticeable shift in the precipitation center toward the reservoir. Further comparisons suggest that reservoir operation shifts the key influencing factors of local precipitation patterns from those characterized by high variability to those characterized by low variability. Changes in soil water retention capacity likely play a significant role in these precipitation changes. We also found a significant positive coupling between soil moisture and precipitation in the study area, which has been a focal point of recent research. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms through which reservoir construction impacts precipitation.

AB  - The spatial heterogeneity of landslide influencing factors is the main reason for the poor generalizability of the susceptibility evaluation model. This study aimed to construct a comprehensive explanatory framework for landslide susceptibility evaluation models based on the SHAP (SHapley Additive explanation)-XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) algorithm, analyze the regional characteristics and spatial heterogeneity of landslide influ-encing factors, and discuss the heterogeneity of the generalizability of the models under different landscapes. Firstly, we selected different regions in typical mountainous hilly region and constructed a geospatial database containing 12 landslide influencing factors such as elevation, annual average rainfall, slope, lithology, and NDVI through field surveys, satellite images, and a literature review. Subsequently, the landslide susceptibility eval-uation model was constructed based on the XGBoost algorithm and spatial database, and the prediction results of the landslide susceptibility evaluation model were explained based on regional topography, geology, and hy-drology using the SHAP algorithm. Finally, the model was generalized and applied to regions with both similar and very different topography, geology, meteorology, and vegetation, to explore the spatial heterogeneity of the generalizability of the model. The following conclusions were drawn: the spatial distribution of landslides is heterogeneous and complex, and the contribution of each influencing factor on the occurrence of landslides has obvious regional characteristics and spatial heterogeneity. The generalizability of the landslide susceptibility evaluation model is spatially heterogeneous and has better generalizability to regions with similar regional characteristics. Further explanation of the XGBoost landslide susceptibility evaluation model using the SHAP method allows quantitative analysis of the differences in how much various factors contribute to disasters due to spatial heterogeneity, from the perspective of global and local evaluation units. In summary, the integrated explanatory framework based on the SHAP-XGBoost model can quantify the contribution of influencing factors on landslide occurrence at both global and local levels, which is conducive to the construction and improvement of the influencing factor system of landslide susceptibility in different regions. It can also provide a reference for predicting potential landslide hazard-prone areas and for Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) research.

AB  - This study developed an interpretable machine-learning model using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to predict the soundscape quality in urban open spaces by integrating auditory, visual, and especially thermal perception features. Data collected from a field survey involving 24 public open spaces in Hong Kong, including perceptual responses from 1,882 participants and physical measurements, formed the basis of the analysis. The prediction model was constructed using the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, as it outperformed the Random Forest (RF) algorithm and significantly exceeded the performance of traditional multiple linear regression (MLR) models in handling datasets with high contextual complexity. To circumvent the shortcomings of non-transparency and non-interpretable in machine-learning models, this study incorporated SHAP analysis to identify the most influential factors for open space soundscape and to investigate their interactions, which has not been revealed in earlier soundscape research. LAeq, perceived dominance of road traffic noise, greenery percentage and PET, were identified as the most influential factors. LAeq and perceived dominance of road traffic noise had significant negative effects, especially when LAeq exceeded 68 dBA. Greenery percentage showed a threshold effect, with dominant and positive contributions only when coverage exceeded 40 %. Notably, PET and its interaction with LAeq had a significant impact, with high temperatures (> 35 degrees C) intensifying the negative impacts of high sound pressure levels. These findings underscore the importance of "sound-visual-thermal" interactions and highlight that urban design should minimize the coexistence of high sound pressure levels, elevated temperatures, and heightened road traffic noise perceptions.

AB  - Regular speeders are those who commit speeding recidivism during a period. Among their speeding behaviors, some occurring in specific scenarios may cause more hazards to road users. Therefore, there is a need to evaluate the driving risks if the regular speeders have different speeding propensities. This study considers speeding -related hard-braking events (SHEs) as a safety surrogate measure and recognizes the regular speeders who encounter at least one SHEs during the study period as risky individuals. To identify speeding behaviors and hard-braking events from low-frequency GPS trajectories, we compare the average travel speed between pairwise adjacent GPS points to the posted speed limit and examine the speed curve and the corresponding travel distance between these GPS points, respectively. Thereafter, a logistic model, XGBoost, and three 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) including AlexNet CNN, Mini-AlexNet CNN, and Simple CNN are respectively developed to recognize the regular speeders who encountered SHEs based on their speeding propensities. The pro-posed Mini-AlexNet CNN achieves a global F1-score of 91% and recall of 90% on the testing data, which are superior to other models. Further, the study uses the Shapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) framework to visually interpret the contribution of speeding propensities on SHE likelihood. It is found that speeding by 50% or greater for no more than 285 m is the most dangerous kind among all the speeding behaviors. Speeding on roads without bicycle lanes or on roads with roadside parking and excessive accesses increases the probability of encountering SHEs. Based on the analyses, we put forward tailored recommendations that aim to restrict hazard-related speeding behaviors rather than speeding behaviors of all kinds.

AB  - This study explored how transportation accessibility and traffic volumes for automobiles, buses, and trucks are related. This study employed machine learning techniques, specifically the extreme gradient boosting decision tree model (XGB) and Shapley Values (SHAP), with national data sources in South Korea collected from the Korea Transport Institute, Statistics Korea, and National Spatial Data Infrastructure Portal. Several key findings of feature importance and plots in non-linear relationships are as follows: First, accessibility indicators exhibited around 5 to 10% of feature importance except for Mart (around 50%). Second, better accessibility to public transportation infrastructures, such as bus stops and transit stations, was associated with higher annual average daily traffic (AADT), particularly in metropolitan areas including Seoul and Busan. Third, access to large-scale markets may have unintended effects on traffic volumes for both vehicles and automobiles. Fourth, it was shown that lower rates of AADT were associated with higher accessibility to elementary schools for all three modes of transportation. This study contributes to (1) understanding complex relationships between the variables, (2) emphasizing the role of transportation accessibility in transportation plans and policies, and (3) offering relevant policy implications.

AB  - Flight incidents are characterized by complex mechanisms, leading to poor prediction model robustness and explainability. Based on the full-dimensional description of flight incidents, the explainable module is added to the prediction model to achieve its accuracy, stability, and explainability. Firstly, imbalance processing is performed employing the sampling method, and a genetic algorithm (GA) is applied for feature selection; these results are then considered as prediction model input. Secondly, an extreme gradient boosting algorithm (XGBoost)-based incident severity prediction model is established with five categories of none, minor, serious, fatal, and total as prediction labels; real data is used for validation, and the model shows good robustness and superiority. Finally, the SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) is introduced to explain the correlation between incidents severity and input features and to measure feature importance. The results show that the proposed method has higher prediction accuracy and robustness. Which can provide some decision-making reference for aviation operation management departments to emergencies, learn the deep-seated law of incidents, and promote the paradigm of active safety management.

AB  - Ultra -high-performance concrete (UHPC) has rapidly become a material of choice in modern construction owing to its favorable properties, such as superior strength, toughness, and durability. Yet, accurate quantification of damage states using appropriate engineering demand parameters (EDPs) remains a significant challenge in the performance -based seismic design (PBSD) of UHPC columns. This gap is especially evident in the scarcity of research focused on the PBSD of UHPC columns. Therefore, this study aims to develop an explainable machine learning (ML) powered predictive model for the drift ratio limit states of UHPC bridge columns across four damage states. To achieve this, a fiber -based numerical model was developed and then validated against largescale experimental results of UHPC columns tested under reverse cyclic loading. The Latin hypercube sampling method is employed to generate a comprehensive database of UHPC bridge columns (10,000 UHPC columns), considering uncertainties across a spectrum of design factors, including column geometry, material characteristics, reinforcement ratio, and axial load ratio. The drift ratios at the initiation of four damage states are determined using the numerical model. Subsequently, the power of the ML algorithm is leveraged to introduce drift ratio limit states for UHPC columns that capture the onset of four different damage states. The efficacy of the developed model is assessed using a range of statistical metrics, including the composite fitness score, D X % metrics, coefficient of determination, root mean squared error (RMSE), normalized RMSE, and mean absolute error, which demonstrated high predictive accuracy of the drift ratio limit states on both the training and unseen or test datasets. Furthermore, a model -agnostic Shapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) is used to explain the output of the model and examine the influence of various design factors on drift ratio across the damage states. Notably, the axial load ratio and aspect ratio are found to be major factors in determining the drift ratios across the damage states. The developed model is deployed into a software tool in order to enable its practical application. Additionally, the implementation of the developed model in the context of PBSD is illustrated through a design example. Furthermore, the study proposed capacity uncertainty parameters to aid the fragility assessment of UHPC columns. Finally, the proposed model, along with capacity uncertainty parameters, is used for the fragility assessment of UHPC columns reinforced with varying steel bar grades. The results demonstrate the less vulnerability of UHPC columns reinforced with higher bar grade, yet the effect of bar grade lessens at severe damage levels.

AB  - Recent approaches to Explainable AI (XAI) promise to satisfy diverse user expectations by allowing them to steer the interaction in order to elicit content relevant to them. However, little is known about how and to what extent the explainee takes part actively in the process of explaining. To tackle this empirical gap, we exploratively examined naturally occurring everyday explanations in doctor-patient interactions (N = 11). Following the social design of XAI, we view explanations as emerging in interactions: first, we identified the verbal behavior of both the explainer and the explainee in the sequential context, which we could assign to phases that were either monological or dialogical; second, we investigated in particular who was responsible for the initiation of the different phases. Finally, we took a closer look at the global conversational structure of explanations by applying a context-sensitive model of organizational jobs, thus adding a third layer of analysis. Results show that in our small sample of conversational explanations, both monological and dialogical phases varied in their length, timing of occurrence (at the early or later stages of the interaction) and their initiation (by the explainer or the explainee). They alternated several times in the course of the interaction. However, we also found some patterns suggesting that all interactions started with a monological phase initiated by the explainer. Both conversational partners contributed to the core organizational job that constitutes an explanation. We interpret the results as an indication for naturally occurring everyday explanations in doctor-patient interactions to be co-constructed on three levels of linguistic description: (1) by switching back and forth between monological to dialogical phases that (2) can be initiated by both partners and (3) by the mutual accomplishment and thus responsibility for an explanation's core job that is crucial for the success of the explanation. Because of the explorative nature of our study, these results need to be investigated (a) with a larger sample and (b) in other contexts. However, our results suggest that future designs of artificial explainable systems should design the explanatory dialogue in such a way that it includes monological and dialogical phases that can be initiated not only by the explainer but also by the explainee, as both contribute to the core job of explicating procedural, clausal, or conceptual relations in explanations.

AB  - Motorcycle crashes pose a serious problem because their probability of causing casualties is greater than that of passenger vehicle crashes. Therefore, accurately identifying the factors that influence motorcycle crashes is essential for enhancing traffic safety and public health. The aim of this study was to address three major research gaps: first, existing studies have relatively overlooked the built environment in relation to visual factors; second, existing crash prediction models have not fully reflected the differences in built environment characteristics between areas with frequent motorcycle crashes and areas with frequent casualties; and third, multidimensional analysis for variable selection is limited, and the interpretability of the models is insufficient. Therefore, this study proposes a comprehensive framework for motorcycle crash and casualty estimation. The framework uses a data cube model incorporating OLAP operations to provide deeper insights into crash influencing factors at different levels of abstraction. We also utilized the XGBoost model to predict motorcycle high crash spots and casualty risk and integrate visual factors extracted from Google Street View images and community-level urban environments into the model. SHAP techniques were used to analyze and interpret the global and local feature importance of the models. Our results revealed that the factors affecting areas with frequent motorcycle crashes and the factors that affect casualties differ. In particular, visual factors such as vegetation and the sky ratio are important for estimating casualties. We aim to provide practical guidelines for a safe environment for motorcycle crashes.

AB  - Traffic crash rates are often closely related to the region's socio-demographic, commuting behavior, motivated by the risks associated with increased region density and excessive congestion. However, crash rates of different severities may vary considerably due to socio-spatial disparities and the mitigation behaviors adopted across regions. Thus, this study elucidates the intricate effects of socio-demographic dynamics and commuting behavior on overall and fatal traffic crash rates across Florida's counties, with particular emphasis on the underlying factors of spatial inequality. Employing an interpretable machine learning model, specifically eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), we demonstrate its superiority in detecting spatial heterogeneity and the complex effects of various factors compared to traditional spatial statistical models, e.g. Spatial Lag Model (SLM) and Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression model (MGWR). A comprehensive simulation experiment was designed to validate the dependability of modeled fittings, which confirms XGBoost as a reliable alternative to conventional spatial statistical models, particularly when dealing with datasets that including complex effects including spatial lag, spatial heterogeneity, non-linear effects and potential interaction effects. Furthermore, the totally empirical findings for Florida reveal the spatial variations in overall and fatal crash rates, correlating significantly with socio-demographic and commute pattern variables. An endogeneity test has been conducted initially for empirical datasets, accompanied by strategies to eliminate the biasing effect of endogenous variables on subsequent modeling process. Finally, key variables include population demographics, commute duration, education levels, unemployment rates, and intersection density produce heterogeneous effects on overall and fatal traffic crash rates. Notably, the study dispels the conventional belief that higher overall crash rates directly correlate with higher fatal crash rates in the same regions, underscoring the importance of distinct analysis. Policy measures should focus on improving accessibility to road infrastructure and healthcare services, with tailored approaches for sparse and densely populated areas. These findings underscore the need to address spatial inequalities in transportation infrastructure and policy measures to reduce traffic crash rates and improve road safety across all regions.

AB  - This paper uses a generalised stacking method to introduce a novel hybrid model that combines a one-dimensional convolutional neural network 1DCNN with extreme gradient boosting XGBoost. We compared the predictive accuracies of the proposed hybrid architecture with three conventional algorithms-1DCNN, XGBoost and logistic regression (LR) using a dataset of over twenty thousand peer-to-peer (P2P) consumer credit observations. By leveraging the SHAP algorithm, the research provides a detailed analysis of feature importance, contributing to the model's predictions and offering insights into the overall and individual significance of different features. The findings demonstrate that the hybrid model outperforms the LR, XGBoost and 1DCNN models in terms of classification accuracy. Furthermore, the research addresses concern regarding fairness and bias by showing that removing potentially discriminatory features, such as age and gender, does not significantly impact the hybrid model's classification capabilities. This suggests that fair and unbiased credit scoring models can achieve high effectiveness levels without compromising accuracy. This paper makes significant contributions to academic research and practical applications in credit risk management by presenting a hybrid model that offers superior classification accuracy and promotes interpretability using the model agnostic SHAP framework.

AB  - The use of machine learning models for productivity prediction in complex manufacturing systems has garnered significant attention. However, the implementation of conventional black -box machine learning models is challenging due to the complexity and limited data availability in aircraft final assembly lines. These challenges stem from a lack of explainability, leading to compromised accuracy and diminished trustworthiness. To address this issue, this paper proposes an explainable neural network model, the Attention-SP-LSTM-FIG, specifically designed for productivity prediction in aircraft final assembly lines. First, the serial -parallel LSTM is utilized to map the process sequence within each assembly station, and a customized attention mechanism maps the requirements of workers and materials. This process results in independent sub -models corresponding to each station. Subsequently, the outputs from each sub -model are combined using a specially -designed final integrated gate to produce the final output. Finally, a post -hoc analysis of the weight data in the model is performed following the backpropagation order to identify the various production bottlenecks in the assembly line. The performance of the proposed model has been evaluated through an industrial case study. In terms of accuracy, the Attention-SP-LSTM-FIG surpasses other benchmark neural network models in terms of error, correlation, and precision metrics. Regarding explainability, the Attention-SP-LSTM-FIG can precisely identify bottlenecks for practitioners, thus facilitating a better understanding of the rationale behind the model's outputs.

AB  - Rapid urbanization has intensified urban heat island (UHI) effects, highlighting the need to understand UHI drivers to improve local thermal environments. While previous research has shown Urban spatial morphology significantly influences land surface temperature (LST), the mechanisms and characteristics of this impact across different geographic conditions remain unclear. Based on this, we selected the main urban areas of Chengdu and Lhasa as examples, using machine learning models and Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) method to reveal the linear and nonlinear relationships between Urban spatial morphology and LST from a morphological perspective. The results show that: (1) The built environment has the most significant impact on LST in plain cities, while the morphology of green space more strongly regulates LST in plateau cities. (2) Building height and density of core both reflect a role in reducing LST in plateau cities. (3) The interaction mechanisms of building density and building height features show the same trend in both plain and plateau cities. However, density of branch between 0.1 and 0.2 reduces LST in plain cities, while densities below 0.1 are more effective in reducing LST in plateau cities. Our results can provide refined and differentiated references for urban planners dedicated to mitigating UHI.

AB  - Background Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has emerged as a global public health concern. Identifying and preventing subclinical atherosclerosis (SCAS), an early indicator of CVD, is critical for improving cardiovascular outcomes. This study aimed to construct interpretable machine learning models for predicting SCAS risk in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients.Methods This study included 3084 T2DM individuals who received health care at Zhenhai Lianhua Hospital, Ningbo, China, from January 2018 to December 2022. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator combined with random forest-recursive feature elimination were used to screen for characteristic variables. Linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression, Naive Bayes, random forest, support vector machine, and extreme gradient boosting were employed in constructing risk prediction models for SCAS in T2DM patients. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was employed to assess the predictive capacity of the model through 10-fold cross-validation. Additionally, the SHapley Additive exPlanations were utilized to interpret the best-performing model.Results The percentage of SCAS was 38.46% (n=1186) in the study population. Fourteen variables, including age, white blood cell count, and basophil count, were identified as independent risk factors for SCAS. Nine predictors, including age, albumin, and total protein, were screened for the construction of risk prediction models. After validation, the random forest model exhibited the best clinical predictive value in the training set with an AUC of 0.729 (95% CI: 0.709-0.749), and it also demonstrated good predictive value in the internal validation set [AUC: 0.715 (95% CI: 0.688-0.742)]. The model interpretation revealed that age, albumin, total protein, total cholesterol, and serum creatinine were the top five variables contributing to the prediction model.Conclusion The construction of SCAS risk models based on the Chinese T2DM population contributes to its early prevention and intervention, which would reduce the incidence of adverse cardiovascular prognostic events.

AB  - Climate disasters unfold multitudes of effects, from societal and commercial disruptions to fuel and power shortages. These consequences escalate further in cascading disasters, where individuals are more likely to respond unwarrantedly due to the lack of preparation and situational awareness. A noticeable gap exists in comprehending the linkages between public responses to such disasters and socioeconomic and spatial disparities, which are critical to the provision of effective guidance and situational information to those affected. Based on mobile phone data and various socioeconomic, built environment, and geographical variables, this study systematically examines human mobility-based public responses during a cascading fuel shortage crisis. The spatiotemporal analysis uncovered a significant increase in visits to gasoline stations during and after the crisis and a decrease in mean distance traveled at the Census Block Group level. Furthermore, mobility prediction models were constructed using the random forest regression algorithm, which can adequately forecast visits and mean distance traveled to gasoline stations across different crisis stages. The Shapley Additive Explanations analysis reveals how various factors (e.g., educational attainment and distance to the coast) influenced public responses. These findings reinforce the importance of tailored disaster response education and situational awareness to ensure equitable resource access during cascading disasters.

AB  - Outdoor jogging, as a physical exercise beneficial for health, has proliferated worldwide. However, under -standing the nonlinear and heterogeneous associations between environmental factors and jogging behavior remains challenging. This study established an explainable spatial machine learning framework combining Geographically Weighted-Random Forest (GW-RF) and SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) model to address the nonlinearity, spatial heterogeneity, and interpretability. Using large-scale GPS trajectories and multi-source big data, this study provides the global and local explanations of nonlinear associations in Beijing, China. Our findings highlight that (1) Built Environment (BE) factors play a more important role than visual landscape factors in determining jogging behavior, with sports facilities such as tracks and parks having higher contribu-tions. (2) All environmental variables, including the BE, visual landscape, and social economics, exhibit nonlinear and threshold effects on jogging behavior. (3) Certain factors such as population density, number of parks, Greening View Index, and Sky View Index exhibit differential effects across different periods, regions, and mobility patterns of jogging. (4) Compared with the Ordinary Least Squares model, Geographically Weighted Regression model, and Random Forest model, GW-RF model demonstrates improved performance in modeling and predicting the jogging flow. The findings have important implications for urban planners seeking to create a supportive environment that promotes outdoor jogging.

AB  - Accurate air quality forecasting is essential for urban management and public health, yet it remains challenging due to the complexity of spatiotemporal air pollution dynamics and the interplay of static and dynamic urban factors. Traditional models often neglect the influence of static urban drivers, such as built environment features, which are critical to understanding pollution patterns. Addressing this limitation, we propose a multi-view, multi-modal Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (STGNN) framework that integrates dynamic pollution data with static urban environmental semantics to improve predictive performance and interpretability. By embedding static features, such as Points of Interest (POIs), into the graph structure and leveraging a selfattention mechanism, our model captures complex spatial dependencies and temporal dynamics. Furthermore, an integrated Explainer module enhances transparency by revealing the spatial and feature-level influences driving air quality predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach not only achieves superior predictive accuracy compared to benchmark models but also provides actionable insights into the relationships between urban features and air quality. This study highlights the importance of integrating multi-modal data and interpretability in advancing air quality prediction, offering valuable implications for urban planning and pollution mitigation strategies.

AB  - Intensive irrigation has been proven to profoundly impact climate through the surface energy budget. However, the impacts of irrigation and climate interactions on gross primary productivity (GPP) in maize cultivated areas remain uncertain. Here we quantified the irrigation effects on maize GPP ( increment GPP) across China by combining a land surface model and a light-use efficiency model and using satellite-based irrigation water use. We show that irrigation significantly contributed to an increase in maize GPP by an average of 430 gC center dot m-2 center dot yr-1, equivalent to 28% of the irrigated maize GPP in China. These benefits ( increment GPP) were attributed to irrigation effects (water supply, surface cooling) and climate interactions based on a machine learning framework (eXtreme Gradient Boosting model-SHapley Additive exPlanations). Irrigation water supply and surface cooling explained 54% +/- 19% and 23% +/- 20% of increment GPP respectively, the rest being due to strong climate interactions with irrigation through water and energy balance. Assuming business-as-usual irrigation levels, changing climate both increases and decreases Delta GPP over different regions, driven primarily by temperature changes. The irrigation benefits in those areas under heat stress are greatly threatened due to changing climate. The roles of climate change on increment GPP are reversed from beneficial to detrimental in the North China Plain, dominated by different warming levels of future scenarios. Our analysis provides new insights into assessing irrigation potential with the climate interactions and future irrigation priority regions.
   Irrigation is the most important water use sector accounting for about 70% of the global freshwater withdrawals and contributing 75% of China's total grain production. Application of irrigation water significantly alters agroecosystem water cycle, energy cycle and carbon cycle. The magnitudes of irrigation impact are also influenced by climate variability. In this study, we simulated irrigation benefits for maize gross primary productivity (GPP) using land surface models and satellite observations. The effects of climate interactions on the irrigation benefits were untangled using an explainable machine learning framework (eXtreme Gradient Boosting model-SHapley Additive exPlanations). We found that alterations in water cycle (water supply) and energy cycle (surface cooling) accounted for 54% +/- 19% and 23% +/- 20% of the irrigation benefits variability respectively, the rest being due to temperature-dominated climate interactions. With the climate change driven by persist warming, the irrigation benefits will be substantially reduced for those regions under ongoing heat stress, such as North China Plain. Future maize productivity will be greatly threatened by changing climate, considering the prevailing negative trends for the irrigation benefits throughout the nation. Reinforcing anthropogenic activities such as irrigation water management and planting structure adjustment are strongly required to improve crop resilience to climate variability.
   Irrigation contribution to the maize gross primary productivity across 15 agricultural regions is quantified in ChinaThe irrigation benefits explained by water supply and cooling are identified, and the rest being due to climate interactionsChanging climate both increases and decreases irrigation benefits for maize over different regions, contingent on heat conditions

AB  - Data-driven techniques improve the quality of talent training comprehensively for university by discovering potential academic problems and proposing solutions. We propose an interpretable prediction method for university student academic crisis warning, which consists of K-prototype-based student portrait construction and Catboost-SHAP-based academic achievement prediction. The academic crisis warning experiment is carried out on desensitization multi-source student data of a university. The experimental results show that the proposed method has significant advantages over common machine learning algorithms. In terms of achievement prediction, mean square error (MSE) reaches 24.976, mean absolute error (MAE) reaches 3.551, coefficient of determination (R-2) reaches 80.3%. The student portrait and Catboost-SHAP method are used for visual analysis of the academic achievement factors, which provide intuitive decision support and guidance assistance for education administrators.

AB  - Vision-based quality inspection is a key step to ensure the quality control of complex industrial products. However, accurate defect recognition for complex products with information-rich, structure-irregular and significantly different patterns is still a tough problem, since it causes the strong visual interference. This paper proposes a causal deep learning method (CDLM) to tackle the explainable vision-based quality inspection under visual interference. First, a structural causal model for defect recognition of complex industrial products is constructed and a causal intervention strategy to overcome the background interference is generated. Second, a defect-guided recognition neural network (DGRNN) is constructed, which can realize accurate defect recognition under the training of CDLM via feature-wise causal intervention using two sub-networks with feature difference mechanism. Finally, the causality between defect features and defective product labels can guide the DGRNN to complete the accurate and explainable learning of defect in a causal direction of optimization. Quantitative experiments show that the proposed method achieves recognition accuracy of 94.09% and 93.95% on two fabric datasets respectively, which outperforms the cutting-edge inspection models. Besides, Grad-CAM visualization experiments show that the proposed method successfully captures the data causality and realizes the explainable defect recognition.

AB  - Concrete-filled steel tubular (CFST) columns have been popular in the construction industry due to enhanced mechanical properties such as higher strength and ductility, higher seismic resistance, and aesthetics. Extensive experimental, numerical and analytical studies have been conducted in the past few decades to assess the structural response of CFST columns under various loading conditions. However, there is still uncertainty in predicting the capacity of CFST columns, and most of the current codes are conservative. In this paper, data-driven machine learning (ML) models have been developed to predict the axial compression capacity of rectangular CFST columns. An extensive database of 719 experiments was collected from literature and is randomly used to train, test, and validate the ML models. Seven ML models, namely lasso regression, random forest, Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Categorical Gradient Boosting (CatBoost), are evaluated to predict the compression capacity of CFST stub columns under axial load. The performance of the different ML models in predicting the compressive strength of CFST columns is compared by different code equations prevalent in different parts of the world. It is found that LightGBM and CatBoost models performed better with an accuracy of 97.9% and 98.3%, respectively, compared to the existing design codes in predicting the capacity of CFST columns. Feature importance analyses and SHapley Additive explanations (SHAP) explain the ML model performances and make the developed models interpretable. Resistance factor is determined using the best performing ML model for compressive strength prediction of CFST stub columns following AISC 360-16 code provision.

AB  - The Eurasian grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) is one of the most extensively cultivated horticultural crop worldwide, with significant economic relevance, particularly in wine production. Accurate grapevine variety identification is essential for ensuring product authenticity, quality control, and regulatory compliance. Traditional identification methods have inherent limitations limitations; ampelography is subjective and dependent on skilled experts, while molecular analysis is costly and time-consuming. To address these challenges, recent research has focused on applying deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) techniques for grapevine variety identification. This study systematically analyses 37 recent studies that employed DL and ML models for this purpose. The objective is to provide a detailed analysis of classification pipelines, highlighting the strengths and limitations of each approach. Most studies use DL models trained on leaf images captured in controlled environments at distances of up to 1.2 m. However, these studies often fail to address practical challenges, such as the inclusion of a broader range of grapevine varieties, using data directly acquired in the vineyards, and the evaluation of models under adverse conditions. This review also suggests potential directions for advancing research in this field.

AB  - New technologies, such as machine learning (ML), have provided great potential for evaluating industry workflows and automatically generating key performance indicators (KPIs). However, despite established standards for measuring the efficiency of industrial machinery, there is no precise equivalent for workers' productivity, which would be highly desirable given the lack of a skilled workforce for the next generation of industry workflows. Therefore, an ML solution combining data from manufacturing processes and workers' performance for that goal is required. Additionally, in recent times intense effort has been devoted to explainable ML approaches that can automatically explain their decisions to a human operator, thus increasing their trustworthiness. We propose to apply explainable ML solutions to differentiate between expert and inexpert workers in industrial workflows, which we validate at a quality assessment industrial workstation. Regarding the methodology used, input data are captured by a manufacturing machine and stored in a NoSQL database. Data are processed to engineer features used in automatic classification and to compute workers' KPIs to predict their level of expertise (with all classification metrics exceeding 90%). These KPIs and the relevant features in the decisions are textually explained by natural language expansion on an explainability dashboard. These automatic explanations made it possible to infer knowledge from expert workers for inexpert workers. The latter illustrates the interest of research in self-explainable ML for automatically generating insights to improve productivity in industrial workflows.

AB  - Fire safety is a primary concern in safeguarding lives and property. However, it is challenging to predict fire incidents and identify potential influencing factors due to limitations of data, model accuracy and interpretability. This paper proposes a novel scheme designed to enhance predictive and explainable capabilities by integrating multi-source data, adaptive machine learning methods, and Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) tools for more effective and applicable fire safety management. The scheme shows satisfactory prediction results by leveraging the data from grid-style management systems and our proposed machine learning method with dynamic time warping distance-based time series clustering, significantly outperforming the methods merely based on time series modeling. Moreover, clustered features help to clarify the main influencing risk factors and provide clearer insights for model interpretability. With global SHAP, community clusters capturing community fire event frequency, as well as historical records on fire police rescue, smoke alarms, and fire alarms, are found to be significant risk factors among all the features over the whole communities and periods via the model interpretability analysis, implying that communities where fires used to occur frequently are more likely to occur in future, which should be highly vigilant in real fire management. With local SHAP, specific risk factors that vary across communities can be identified for any single community with a given period. We demonstrate the potential of this integrated machine learning scheme in improving the prediction accuracy and risk identification applicability of fire incidents, which contributes to more effective and customized fire safety management.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Predicting patient readmission is an important task for healthcare risk management, as it can help prevent adverse events, reduce costs, and improve patient outcomes. In this paper, we compare various conventional machine learning models and deep learning models on a multimodal dataset of electronic discharge records from an Irish acute hospital. Methods: We evaluate the effectiveness of several widely used machine learning models that leverage patient demographics, historical hospitalization records, and clinical diagnosis codes to forecast future clinical risks. Our work focuses on addressing two key challenges in the medical fields, data imbalance and the variety of data types, in order to boost the performance of machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, we also employ SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) value visualization to interpret the model predictions and identify both the key data features and disease codes associated with readmission risks, identifying a specific set of diagnosis codes that are significant predictors of readmission within 30 days. Results: Through extensive benchmarking and the application of a variety of feature engineering techniques, we successfully improved the area under the curve (AUROC) score from 0.628 to 0.7 across our models on the test dataset. We also revealed that specific diagnoses, including cancer, COPD, and certain social factors, are significant predictors of 30-day readmission risk. Conversely, bacterial carrier status appeared to have minimal impact due to lower case frequencies. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates how we effectively utilize routinely collected hospital data to forecast patient readmission through the use of conventional machine learning while applying explainable AI techniques to explore the correlation between data features and patient readmission rate.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a pivotal force in enhancing productivity across various sectors, with its impact being profoundly felt within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology domains. Despite AI's rapid adoption, its integration into scientific research faces resistance due to myriad challenges: the opaqueness of AI models, the intricate nature of their implementation, and the issue of data scarcity. In response to these impediments, we introduce SmartCADD, an innovative, open-source virtual screening platform that combines deep learning, computer-aided drug design (CADD), and quantum mechanics methodologies within a user-friendly Python framework. SmartCADD is engineered to streamline the construction of comprehensive virtual screening workflows that incorporate a variety of formerly independent techniques & horbar;spanning ADMET property predictions, de novo 2D and 3D pharmacophore modeling, molecular docking, to the integration of explainable AI mechanisms. This manuscript highlights the foundational principles, key functionalities, and the unique integrative approach of SmartCADD. Furthermore, we demonstrate its efficacy through a case study focused on the identification of promising lead compounds for HIV inhibition. By democratizing access to advanced AI and quantum mechanics tools, SmartCADD stands as a catalyst for progress in pharmaceutical research and development, heralding a new era of innovation and efficiency.

AB  - This paper investigates the predictability of the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) and explores the sources of its predictability using machine learning (ML) techniques. We establish that daily VIX can be predicted with higher accuracy than previously documented, yielding forecasts of significant economic value. Our analysis underscores the efficacy of dynamic training, nonlinear methods and a comprehensive set of economic variables in predicting VIX trends. We identify the weekly jobless claim data as a pivotal variable, revealing its substantial influence on market volatility, an area not extensively explored in prior research. While accurately forecasting VIX spikes poses a challenge, our algorithms demonstrate remarkable adaptability to new data, thereby significantly enhancing the resilience of trading strategies. This research not only contributes to the understanding of VIX predictability but also offers valuable insights for the development of more robust quantitative investment and risk management strategies.

AB  - Logs are valuable information for oil and gas fields as they help to determine the lithology of the formations surrounding the borehole and the location and reserves of subsurface oil and gas reservoirs. However, important logs are often missing in horizontal or old wells, which poses a challenge in field applications. To address this issue, conventional methods involve supplementing the missing logs by either combining geological experience and referring data from nearby boreholes or reconstructing them directly using the remaining logs in the same borehole. Nevertheless, there is currently no quantitative evaluation for the quality and rationality of the constructed log. In this paper, we utilize data from the 2020 machine learning competition of the Society of Petrophysicists and Logging Analysts (SPWLA), which aims to predict the missing compressional wave slowness (DTC) and shear wave slowness (DTS) logs using other logs in the same borehole. We employ the natural gradient boosting (NGBoost) algorithm to construct an Ensemble Learning model that can predicate the results as well as their uncertainty. Furthermore, we combine the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) method to investigate the interpretability of the machine learning model. We compare the performance of the NGBosst model with four other commonly used Ensemble Learning methods, including Random Forest, GBDT, XGBoost, LightGBM. The results show that the NGBoost model performs well in the testing set and can provide a probability distribution for the prediction results. This distribution allows petrophysicists to quantitatively analyze the confidence interval of the constructed log. In addition, the variance of the probability distribution of the predicted log can be used to justify the quality of the constructed log. Using the SHAP explainable machine learning model, we calculate the importance of each input log to the predicted results as well as the coupling relationship among input logs. Our findings reveal that the NGBoost model tends to provide greater slowness prediction results when the neutron porosity (CNC) and gamma ray (GR) are large, which is consistent with the cognition of petrophysical models. Furthermore, the machine learning model can capture the influence of the changing borehole caliper on slowness, where the influence of borehole caliper on slowness is complex and not easy to establish a direct relationship. These findings are in line with the physical principle of borehole acoustics. Finally, by using the explainable machine learning model, we observe that although we did not correct the effect of borehole caliper on the neutron porosity log through preprocessing, the machine learning model assigned a greater importance to the influence of the caliper, achieving the same effect as caliper correction.

AB  - Sustainable land-use planning and catastrophe risk reduction depend critically on landslide susceptibility mapping. The complex, nonlinear interconnections of environmental and human elements cause terrain instability and challenge conventional prediction methods. In this work, we offer a DeepLabV3+-based deep learning framework coupled with geographic information systems and multicriteria decision making methods for spatial prediction of landslide risk, over the Dubai coastal and urban region (covering approximately 4000 km(2)). The approach uses an annotated dataset for semantic segmentation and high-resolution satellite images from the Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Center. On Google Colab with GPU acceleration, the model is trained and verified and then further improved for computational efficiency on a Mac M1 machine. Our results show an overall accuracy of 91.3%, a mean intersection over union of 82.5%, and an F1-score of 88.4%, demonstrating strong classification performance throughout a range of land cover types. The confusion matrix analysis highlights strong segmentation accuracy for water bodies (94.2%) and structures (92.4%). Considerable misclassification between roadways and unpaved terrain results from spectral similarities. Furthermore, the perclass Dice Coefficient analysis confirms that the model can efficiently discriminate intricate topographical patterns. Especially in fast-expanding areas such as Dubai, UAE, it provides a scalable solution for landslide susceptibility mapping, catastrophe risk management, and sustainable urban design. Future work will explore multisensor data fusion, real-time inference, and applying explainable artificial intelligence techniques to enhance model interpretability in dynamic terrain settings.

AB  - Critical infrastructure (CI) are at risk of failure due to the increased frequency and magnitude of climate extremes related to climate change. It is thus essential to include them in a risk management framework to identify risk hotspots, develop risk management policies and support adaptation strategies to enhance their resilience. However, the lack of information on the exposure of CI to natural hazards prevents their incorporation in large-scale risk assessments. This study sets out to improve the representation of CI for risk assessment studies by building a neural network model to detect CI assets from optical remote sensing imagery. We present a pipeline that extracts CI from OpenStreetMap, processes the imagery and assets' masks, and trains a Mask R-CNN model that allows for instance segmentation of CI at the asset level. This study provides an overview of the pipeline and tests it with the detection of electrical substations assets in the Netherlands. Several experiments are presented for different under-sampling percentages of the majority class (25%, 50% and 100%) and hyperparameters settings (batch size and learning rate). The highest scoring experiment achieved an Average Precision at an Intersection over Union of 50% of 30.93 and a tile F-score of 89.88%. This allows us to confirm the feasibility of the method and invite disaster risk researchers to use this pipeline for other infrastructure types. We conclude by exploring the different avenues to improve the pipeline by addressing the class imbalance, Transfer Learning and Explainable Artificial Intelligence.

AB  - Buildings' long-term techno-economic performance monitoring is critical for benchmarking in order to reduce costs and environmental impact while providing adequate services. Reliable building stock performance data provide a fundamental knowledge foundation for evidence-based energy efficiency interventions and decarbonisation strategies. Simply put, an adequate understanding of building performance is required to reduce energy consumption, as well as associated costs and emissions. In this framework, Variable-base degree-days-based methods have been widely used for weather normalisation of energy statistics and energy monitoring for Measurement and Verification (M & V) purposes. The base temperature used to calculate degree-days is determined by building thermal characteristics, operation strategies, and occupant behaviour, and thus varies from building to building. In this paper, we develop a variable-base degrees days regression model, typically used for energy monitoring and M & V, using a "proxy" variable, the cost of energy services. The study's goal is to assess the applicability of this type of model as a screening tool to analyse the impact of efficiency measures, as well as to understand the evolution of performance over time, and we test it on nine public schools in the Northern Italian city of Seregno. While not as accurate as M & V techniques, this regression-based approach can be a low-cost tool for tracking performance over time using cost data typically available in digital format and can work reasonably well with limited resolution, such as monthly data. The modelling methodology is simple, scalable and can be automated further, contributing to long-term techno-economic performance monitoring of building stock in the context of incremental built environment digitalization.

AB  - Understanding urban visual perception is crucial for modeling how individuals cognitively and emotionally interact with the built environment. However, traditional survey-based approaches are limited in scalability and often fail to generalize across diverse urban contexts. In this study, we introduce the UP-CBM, a transparent framework that leverages visual foundation models (VFMs) and concept-based reasoning to address these challenges. The UP-CBM automatically constructs a task-specific vocabulary of perceptual concepts using GPT-4o and processes urban scene images through a multi-scale visual prompting pipeline. This pipeline generates CLIP-based similarity maps that facilitate the learning of an interpretable bottleneck layer, effectively linking visual features with human perceptual judgments. Our framework not only achieves higher predictive accuracy but also offers enhanced interpretability, enabling transparent reasoning about urban perception. Experiments on two benchmark datasets-Place Pulse 2.0 (achieving improvements of +0.041 in comparison accuracy and +0.029 in R2) and VRVWPR (+0.018 in classification accuracy)-demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach. These results underscore the potential of integrating VFMs with structured concept-driven pipelines for more explainable urban visual analytics.

AB  - Drought and heatwave are the primary climate extremes for vegetation productivity loss in the global temperate semi-arid grassland, challenging the ecosystem productivity stability in these areas. Previous studies have indicated a significant decline in the resistance of global grassland productivity to drought, but we still lack a systematic understanding of the mechanisms determining the spatiotemporal variations in grassland resistance to drought and heatwave. In this study, we focused on temperate semi-arid grasslands of China (TSGC) to assess the spatiotemporal variations of grassland productivity resistance to different climate extremes: compound dry-hot events, individual drought events, and individual heatwave events that occurred during 2000-2019. Based on the explainable machine learning model, we explored the resistance to the interaction of drought and heatwave and identify the dominant factors determining the spatiotemporal variations in resistance. The results revealed that grassland resistance to climate extremes had decreased in Xilingol Grassland and Mu Us Sandy Land, and had a not significant increase in Otindag Desert during 2000-2019. Human activities and the increase in CO2 concentration causes a decline in resistance in Mu Us Sandy Land, and the increase of VPD and shift of vegetation loss event timing caused a decline in resistance in Xilingol Grassland, while the weakening of climate extremes, especially the shortening of drought duration, increase the resistance in Otindag Desert. Mean annual temperature dominates the spatial differences in resistance among different grasslands. When drought and heatwave occur simultaneously, there is an additive effect on resistance and causes lower resistance to compound dry-hot events compared to individual drought and heatwave events. Our analysis provides crucial insights into understanding the impact of climate extremes on the temperate semi-arid grasslands of China.

AB  - Productivity in opencast mining, particularly in drill-blast (DB) and surface miner (SM) operations, is crucial for optimizing efficiency and reducing costs. These operations are directly affected by fragmentation, which in turn impacts equipment utilization, loading cycle times, and downstream operations. This study analyzed field data such as rock properties, machine parameters, blast design results, and post-blast fragmentation size (0.15-0.82 m), with 0.45 m identified as the optimal fragmentation size for a 12 m3 shovel bucket. Traditional productivity assessments often use simplistic models that fail to capture the complexities of mining operations. To address this, an explainable machine learning (ML) model was developed, integrating fragmentation size, rock and machine parameters, and geometric factors to evaluate DB and SM operations in opencast coal mines. Various ML techniques, such as artificial neural network (ANN), random forest regression (RFR), gradient boosting regressor (GBT), and support vector regression (SVR), were employed to analyze these parameters. Among these, the RFR model demonstrated the highest accuracy, with a coefficients of determination (R2) of 99.5% for training and 99.2% for testing in DB datasets, and 99.9% for training and 99.5% for testing in SM datasets. Furthermore, the RFR model had the lowest root mean square error, mean absolute error, and mean absolute percentage error of 10.35, 4.788, and 2.1% for DB training datasets, and 5.53, 1.75, and 1.5% for SM training datasets, respectively, underscoring its superior performance. Using SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations), the study identified key productivity drivers: SM cycle time, diesel consumption, and coal face length. Fragmentation size, resulting from blasting, was also found to influence shovel efficiency and overall productivity significantly. This paper highlights the effectiveness of ensemble ML models in predicting and analyzing complex productivity dynamics in opencast mining.

AB  - Freeway crash risk prediction is a critical component of traffic safety management, yet existing crash risk models often fail to capture complex driving behaviors and lack interpretability. This study introduces a novel freeway crash risk prediction framework based on the Deep Forest (DF) algorithm, considering the detailed risky driving behavior data. The DF model integrates multi-grained scanning and cascade forest layers, enabling it to capture the complex relationship between risky driving behavior features. SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) are applied to interpret the model's predictions, including both SHAP summary and interaction results. Additionally, ablation studies are conducted to evaluate the contributions of key components like multi-grained scanning and cascade structures to the model's performance. The experimental results demonstrate that the DF model outperforms traditional machine learning models. The DF model achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.825, with a balanced Sensitivity of 0.75 and Specificity of 0.816, surpassing other models. The ablation studies show that removing multi-grained scanning, cascade layers, or completely random tree forest leads to performance declines, confirming the importance of each component. The SHAP analysis highlights that sharp acceleration and braking behaviors have the most significant impact on crash risk, offering clear, interpretable insights into how driving behaviors contribute to risk. Overall, the DF model's superior performance and SHAP-based interpretability provide a powerful tool for traffic safety management. These findings emphasize the value of incorporating both driving behavior intensity and model interpretability into crash risk prediction, offering practical applications for reducing crash rates.

AB  - This study proposes a novel explainable risk assessment framework that integrates the fuzzy Full Consistency Method (FUCOM), fuzzy VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR)-Sort, and fuzzy linguistic summarization to address the challenges of uncertainty, prioritization, and interpretability in risk evaluation. The model enables multi-criteria analysis under linguistic uncertainty, classifies risks into predefined categories, and generates human-readable linguistic summaries to support decision-makers. The proposed methodology is applied to a real-world construction case involving 32 risk items, which are categorized into high, medium, and low risk groups. Comparative analysis with six established multiple criteria sorting algorithms reveals strong alignment in classification outcomes. The novelty of the proposed model lies in enhancing the explainability of multiple criteria sorting algorithms by integrating fuzzy linguistic summarization into the classification process-an aspect largely overlooked in the existing literature. The results demonstrate that the proposed model not only produces consistent risk classifications across alternative methods but also enhances decision-makers' understanding through interpretable linguistic outputs.

AB  - One of the main challenges in reinforced concrete with rebars is the bond strength between the rebars and the concrete in flexural elements. Various studies have been conducted on the effect of different parameters on bond strength. However, the simultaneous effect of these factors under specific conditions remains ambiguous, requiring further tests which are time-consuming and costly. Bringing together several reported data up to now and obtaining a comprehensive output would be valuable. A comprehensive dataset was constructed from 268 data points reported in 19 studies, encapsulating various parameters such as type of reinforcement, concrete strength, embedment length, and environmental conditions. Four machine learning (ML) models, including Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), were applied and optimized through grid search. The XGB model demonstrated superior predictive accuracy, achieving an R2 score of 0.9 post-tuning, underscoring the effectiveness of hyperparameter optimization. Shapley values were utilized to interpret model predictions, highlighting embedment length, concrete compressive strength, and bar size as the most influential features. ML models offer a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative to extensive experimental testing and pave the way for integrating advanced computational techniques in civil engineering to enhance the design and durability of reinforced concrete structures. Eventually, an intuitive and user-friendly interface (UI) model, which eliminates the need for terminal commands and coding, has been developed, accessible on GitHub, and recommended for design practices.

AB  - Concrete is a common building material due to its excellent properties. The engineering performance of concrete depends significantly on its compositions. Characterizing concrete performance and determining its reasonable composition is challenging. This study developed a novel framework to characterize concrete performance and determine the optimal composition based on the simplicial homology global optimization (SHGO) and the eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm. The XGBoost algorithm captured the complex interrelations between the compositions and the corresponding performance. The SHGO was leveraged to determine the reasonable and optimal composition for improving the performance. The light aggregate concrete illustrated the developed framework. Meanwhile, the framework's performance was investigated and validated using laboratory tests. The relative error between the 28-day and 90-day compressive strength and the test value is less than 4 %, and the relative error of the mass is less than 2 %. Compared with the traditional design method, the 90-day compressive strength increased by 2.6 %, and the mass reduced by 5.5 %. Thus, the XGBoost adequately characterizes the performance of the lightweight, and the determined composition is different from the composition determined by the orthogonal experiments. However, the performance of the concrete improved significantly. It proved that the developed framework outperformed the traditional method. It also has essential guiding significance for the performance characterization and composition design of other civil engineering materials. The developed framework provides an excellent, scientific, and promising civil material characterizing and design tool.

TI  - Traffic prediction in SDN for explainable QoS using deep learning approach
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA  - English
AB  - The radical increase of multimedia applications such as voice over Internet protocol (VOIP), image processing, and video-based applications require better quality of service (QoS). Therefore, traffic Predicting and explaining the prediction models is essential. However, elephant flows from those applications still needs to be improved to satisfy Internet users. Elephant flows lead to network congestion, resulting in packet loss, delay and inadequate QoS delivery. Recently, deep learning models become a good alternative for real-time traffic management. This research aims to design a traffic predicting model that can identify elephant flows to prevent network congestion in advance. Thus, we are motivated to develop elephant flow prediction models and explain those models explicitly for network administrators' use in the SDN network. H2O, Deep Autoencoder, and autoML predicting algorithms, including XGBoost, GBM and GDF, were employed to develop the proposed model. The performance of Elephant flow prediction models scored 99.97%, 99.99%, and 100% in validation accuracy of under construction error of 0.0003952, 0.001697, and 0.00000408 using XGBoost, GBM, and GDF algorithms respectively. The models were also explicitly explained using Explainable Artificial Intelligence. Accordingly, packet size and byte size attributes need much attention to detect elephant flows.

AB  - Pest detection is crucial for both agriculture and ecology. The growing global population demands an efficient pest detection system to ensure food security. Pests threaten agricultural productivity, sustainability, and economic development. They also cause damage to machinery, equipment and soil, making effective detection essential for commercial benefits. Traditional pest detection methods are often slow, less accurate and reliant on expert knowledge. With advancements in computer vision and AI, deep transfer learning models (DTLMs) have emerged as powerful solutions. The GradCAM-PestDetNet methodology utilizes object detection models like YOLOv8m, YOLOv8s and YOLOv8n, alongside transfer learning techniques such as VGG16, ResNet50, Effi-cientNetB0, MobileNetV2, InceptionV3 and DenseNet121 for feature extraction. Additionally, Vision Transformers (ViT) and Swim Transformers were explored for their ability to process complex data patterns. To enhance model interpretability, GradCAM-PestDetNet integrates Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), allowing better visualization of model predictions. center dot Uses YOLOv8 models (YOLOv8n for fastest inference at 1.86 ms/img) and transfer learning for pest detection ensuring that the system is viable for low-resource environments. center dot Employs an ensemble model (ResNet50, DenseNet, MobileNet) that achieved 67.07 % accuracy, 66.3 % F1-score and 68.1 % recall. This is an improvement over the baseline CNN which gave an accuracy of 21.5 %. This ensures a more generalized and robust model that is not biased towards the majority class. center dot Integrates Grad-CAM for improved interpretability in pest detection.

AB  - Timely and accurate forecasting of well production in tight gas reservoirs is of paramount importance for comprehensive field development and financial decision-making. Despite the application of deep learning (DL) models in constructing predictive frameworks, their intricate nature and limited interpretability present challenges for petroleum engineers, hindering their understanding of learned inference mechanisms and trust in predictions. This study advocates for the adoption of interpretable DL solutions, incorporating SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), to provide explicit elucidations of a prediction model by implemented by gated recurrent networks. The method's efficacy is substantiated using data from the Tao2 gas field in the Ordos Basin, China. The outcomes underscore the model's exceptional predictive capabilities. Leveraging the SHAP method for global interpretation provides valuable insights into the collective impact of various factors. Simultaneously, employing SHAP for local interpretation furnishes personalized explanations for well productivity predictions. The findings gleaned from this research are poised to enhance well operations and field development planning.

AB  - The El Ni & ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a large-scale global climate pattern that significantly influences tropical vegetation productivity. However, the responses of vegetation productivity in Southeast Asia (SEA) to different ENSO phases remain unclear. In this study, we used multisource gross primary productivity (GPP) products and explainable machine learning method (SHAP) to assess the status of ENSO phases during 1981-2019 and their impact on vegetation productivity in SEA. Our results reveal that El Ni & ntilde;o and La Ni & ntilde;a have exhibited opposite trends over the past 40 years, with El Ni & ntilde;o events decreasing in both frequency and intensity, while La Ni & ntilde;a events have become more frequent since the 21st century. Precipitation and radiation showed distinct and opposing variation patterns across different ENSO phases, whereas temperature variations exhibited a regional pattern that differed from global trends. The average temperatures during both El Ni & ntilde;o and La Ni & ntilde;a were slightly lower than during the neutral phase. ENSO-induced climate anomalies affected vegetation productivity, resulting in a decrease in GPP of 72.3 +/- 48.1 gC m-2 yr-1 during El Ni & ntilde;o and an increase of 31.0 +/- 44.4 gC m-2 yr-1 during La Ni & ntilde;a. Based on SHAP analysis, we found that soil moisture was the primary driver of GPP during ENSO events, with a distinct threshold effect that dynamically shifted with water availability. Furthermore, terrestrial water storage (TWS) predominantly drove variations in atmospheric CO2 growth rate during the land-atmosphere carbon exchange process, with its influence intensifying over time. This study highlights the critical importance of water stress in regulating the carbon cycle of tropical vegetation in SEA.

AB  - We seek to present in the article the account of some looks obtained during a research experience carried out in Maputo, capital of Mozambique, from April to May 2015. In the case of the present look, we highlight the analysis about the singularities of the urban space and its implications in the territorial practices of Vale do Infulene and Marracuene District, around Maputo / MOZ; and around Xai-Xai, capital of Gaza Province; besides the Chidenguele / Xai-Xai beach. As we unraveled the research, we noticed singular stories, with greater emphasis on those of women. Stories that are lived in the context of important events in Mozambican society, such as the process of national independence (1975) and, as one of its consequences, the incorporation of the use of soil / traditional land use; beyond the deep marks left by the Civil War (1976-1992). The alternative productive practices carried out by the communities, in the construction of the territories, can be understood as coexistence of the "advance" of capitalist modernization and maintenance of traditional practices, which resignify the rural and urban spaces and are expressed in an urban landscape with strong rural overlays.

AB  - Projected increases in the intensity and frequency of droughts in the twenty-first century are expected to cause a substantial negative impact on terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP). Yet, the relative role of soil water supply (indicated by soil moisture) and atmospheric water demand (indicated by vapour pressure deficit, VPD) on GPP remains debated, primarily due to their strong covariations, the presence of confounding factors and unresolved causal relationships among the interconnected hydrometeorological drivers of GPP. Here using a causality-guided explainable artificial intelligence framework, we show that soil moisture is the dominant regulator of water stress, surpassing the role of VPD, when and where soil water supply limits ecosystem functions. Temporally, we use in situ flux tower data to demonstrate that soil moisture dominates the GPP response during periods of insufficient soil water supply. Spatially, we assess the global spatial patterns of satellite sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (a proxy for GPP) in water-limited regions and demonstrate that they are mostly dominated by soil moisture. Conversely, VPD plays a greater role in controlling the temporal and spatial variations in GPP than soil moisture when and where soil water supply is not limited. The relative role of soil moisture and VPD is modulated by plant adaptation to long-term climatological aridity. Our findings advance the understanding of the impacts of soil and atmospheric dryness on ecosystem photosynthesis. They provide crucial insights into how terrestrial ecosystems respond to increasing aridity and more frequent droughts, particularly given the potential ecosystem shifts from energy to water limitation.

AB  - Rationale and Objectives: To develop and validate a computed tomography (CT) radiomics-based interpretable machine learning (ML) model for predicting 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) in non-metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Materials and Methods: 559 patients with non-metastatic ccRCCs were retrospectively enrolled from eight independent institutes between March 2013 and January 2019, and were assigned to the primary set (n = 271), external test set 1 (n = 216), and external test set 2 (n = 72). 1316 Radiomics features were extracted via "Pyradiomics." The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm was used for feature selection and Rad-Score construction. Patients were stratified into low and high 5-year recurrence risk groups based on Rad-Score, followed by Kaplan-Meier analyses. Five ML models integrating Rad-Score and clinicopathological risk factors were compared. Models' performances were evaluated via the discrimination, calibration, and decision curve analysis. The most robust ML model was interpreted using the SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method. Results: 13 radiomic features were filtered to produce the Rad-Score, which predicted 5-year RFS with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) of 0.734-0.836. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed significant survival differences based on Rad-Score (all Log-Rank p values < 0.05). The random forest model outperformed other models, obtaining AUCs of 0.826 [95% confidential interval (CI): 0.766-0.879] and 0.799 (95% CI: 0.670-0.899) in the external test set 1 and 2, respectively. The SHAP analysis suggested positive associations between contributing factors and 5-year RFS status in non-metastatic ccRCC. Conclusion: CT radiomics-based interpretable ML model can effectively predict 5-year RFS in non-metastatic ccRCC patients, distinguishing between low and high 5-year recurrence risks.

AB  - Electricity price forecasting in wholesale markets is an essential asset for deciding bidding strategies and operational schedules. The decision making process is limited if no understanding is given on how and why such electricity price points have been forecast. The present article proposes a novel framework that promotes human-machine collaboration in forecasting day-ahead electricity price in wholesale markets. The framework is based on a new model architecture that uses a plethora of statistical and machine learning models, a wide range of exogenous features, a combination of several time series decomposition methods and a collection of time series characteristics based on signal processing and time series analysis methods. The model architecture is supported by open-source automated machine learning platforms that provide a baseline reference used for comparison purposes. The objective of the framework is not only to provide forecasts, but to promote a human-in-the-loop approach by providing a data story based on a collection of model-agnostic methods aimed at interpreting the mechanisms and behavior of the new model architecture and its predictions. The framework has been applied to the Spanish wholesale market. The forecasting results show good accuracy on mean absolute error (1.859, 95% HDI [0.575, 3.924] EUR (MWh)(-1) ) and mean absolute scaled error (0.378, 95% HDI [0.091, 0.934]). Moreover, the framework demonstrates its human-centric capabilities by providing graphical and numeric explanations that augments understanding on the model and its electricity price point forecasts.

KW  - FEATURE CONSTRUCTION
AB  - Feature construction can substantially improve the accuracy of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Genetic Programming (GP) has been proven to be effective at this task by evolving non-linear combinations of input features. GP additionally has the potential to improve ML explainability since explicit expressions are evolved. Yet, in most GP works the complexity of evolved features is not explicitly bound or minimized though this is arguably key for explainability. In this article, we assess to what extent GP still performs favorably at feature construction when constructing features that are (1) Of small-enough number, to enable visualization of the behavior of the ML model; (2) Of small-enough size, to enable interpretability of the features themselves; (3) Of sufficient informative power, to retain or even improve the performance of the ML algorithm. We consider a simple feature construction scheme using three different GP algorithms, as well as random search, to evolve features for five ML algorithms, including support vector machines and random forest. Our results on 21 datasets pertaining to classification and regression problems show that constructing only two compact features can be sufficient to rival the use of the entire original feature set. We further find that a modern GP algorithm, GP-GOMEA, performs best overall. These results, combined with examples that we provide of readable constructed features and of 2D visualizations of ML behavior, lead us to positively conclude that GP-based feature construction still works well when explicitly searching for compact features, making it extremely helpful to explain ML models.

AB  - Flanged reinforced concrete walls also known as H-shaped walls are frequently used in nuclear facilities and conventional buildings due to their substantial lateral strength and stiffness in both directions. These walls mostly fail in shear, and it is essential to accurately estimate their peak shear strength (Vp). However, the provisions of existing building codes to determine peak shear strength have significant limitations such as exclusion of the influence of flanges and consideration of insufficient input parameters. Therefore, this study aimed to construct predictive models for H-shaped walls using machine learning techniques like Bagging Regressor (BR), Gene Expression Programming (GEP), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), based on data gathered from existing literature. The gathered data had twelve inputs including shear span ratio (hw/lw), the ratio of flange thickness to web thickness (tf/tw), and loading type (M) etc. Out of all the algorithms, only GEP depicted its output as an equation. The performance of the algorithms was checked using error metrices like Objective Function (OF), and coefficient of determination (R2) etc. which showed that XGB exhibited the highest accuracy having the testing R2 equal to 0.99. Additionally, shapely (SHAP), Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE), and partial dependence plots (PDP) analysis were employed which showed that flange length, loading type, and shear span ratio are some of the most contributing variables to determine Vp. Furthermore, a graphical user interface (GUI) has been developed to efficiently compute Vp of RC squat H-shaped walls to help professionals in the civil engineering industry.

AB  - Background Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease, seriously threatening the public health. Although the proportion of patients with lean NAFLD is lower than that of patients with obese NALFD, it should not be overlooked. This study aimed to construct interpretable machine learning models for predicting lean NAFLD risk in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients.Methods This study enrolled 1,553 T2DM individuals who received health care at the First Affiliated Hospital of Ningbo University, Ningbo, China, from November 2019 to November 2024. Feature screening was performed using the Boruta algorithm and the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). Linear discriminant analysis (LDA), logistic regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and extreme gradient boosting (XGboost) were used in constructing risk prediction models for lean NAFLD in T2DM patients. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to assess the predictive capacity of the model. Additionally, we employed SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis to unveil the specific contributions of individual features in the machine learning model to the prediction results.Results The prevalence of lean NAFLD in the study population was 20.3%. Eight variables, including age, body mass index (BMI), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), were identified as independent risk factors for lean NAFLD. Ten predictive factors, including BMI, ALT, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), were screened for the construction of risk prediction models. The random forest model demonstrated superior performance compared to alternative machine learning (ML) algorithms, achieving an AUC of 0.739 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.676-0.802) in the training set, and it also exhibited the best predictive value in the internal validation set with an AUC of 0.789 (95% CI: 0.722-0.856). In addition, the SHAP method identified TG, ALT, GGT, BMI, and UA as the top five variables influencing the predictions of the RF model.Conclusion The construction of lean NAFLD risk models based on the Chinese T2DM population, particularly the RF model, facilitates its early prevention and intervention, thereby reducing the risks of intrahepatic and extrahepatic adverse outcomes.

AB  - This study proposed a performance-interpretable deep learning model for rolling bearing fault diagnosis that integrates an intelligent fusion of sound and vibration signals and self-supervised learning via an interpretable attention mechanism. A deep learning decoder framework with a compressed attention mechanism encoder is developed to automatically learn the correlation between sound and vibration signals and the fusion method, eliminating the need for manual feature extraction and multi-model construction. By introducing the dynamic attention mechanism, the strength of the correlation between sound and vibration signals can be sensed in real-time to adapt to different scenarios flexibly. When the correlation is strong, due to the high similarity between the signals, a complex feature weight fusion strategy is employed to extract and fuse the essential features of different modalities more efficiently, enabling this fusion to mutually enhance the expressive power of the features for feature fusion. Whereas, when the correlation is weak, the correlation between the signals is low and forcing a complex fusion may introduce more noise and redundant information, therefore a hybrid input strategy is used. The CAME-Transformer Decoder (CAME-TD) model dynamically updates the correlation thresholds and fusion strategies using regularized loss constraints to ensure adaptation to multimodal signal differences. During model training, visual analysis of the attention mechanism role weights and feature learning helps in parameter optimization and performance evaluation. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, with an improvement in fault diagnosis performance under various operating and noise conditions compared to a single signal input. Moreover, the CAME-TD model not only achieves considerable diagnostic performance but also enhances interpretability, providing a new approach for rolling bearing fault diagnosis.

AB  - The physical and physiological condition of fish directly influences their swimming performance, which is crucial for their health and survival. This study explored how physical characteristics affect swimming performance in rainbow trout. 3D images were used to capture the morphology of fish and assess its impact on critical swimming speed (Ucrit), measured via individual swim tests. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was utilized to predict Ucrit from the images. Using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Maps (GradCAM), image regions that contributed to Ucrit predictions were visualized. These regions were further refined into areas that are biologically relevant to Ucrit, leading to the definition of four swim traits: head volume, caudal fin volume, epaxial muscle volume, and shape. Our findings indicated that Ucrit is moderately heritable. Genetically, heavier fish demonstrated poorer swimming performance; among fish of the same weight, those with larger and broader epaxial muscles, larger heads, and smaller caudal fins performed worse. Although genetic improvement of Ucrit is feasible, caution is advised because of potential correlated responses that reduce the body volume and epaxial muscle volume. The interdisciplinary workflow (data collection, model construction, visualization, interpretation, definition, and evaluation) in this study demonstrated how image-based deep learning can be used as a hypothesis-free approach to deepen the understanding of the genetic background of complex traits. Additionally, it highlights the value of genetic analysis to validate the physiological interpretation of Explainable AI, broadening the opportunities to discover novel phenotypes in aquaculture.

AB  - The accurate prediction of roof stress in mined-out areas is crucial for ensuring mine safety. However, existing study methods often overlook the increasingly available image data and fail to balance the model predictive capability with interpretability. To address these issues, this study innovatively integrates 3D laser scanning image features into the prediction of roof stress in mined-out areas. Image features are extracted using pre-trained deep-learning models and combined with traditional geological parameters to construct multiple machine-learning models for prediction. The experimental results demonstrate that models incorporating image features significantly outperform traditional models that rely solely on geological parameters in terms of prediction accuracy, interpretability, and complexity, revealing the critical role of image features in stress prediction. Furthermore, the use of SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to interpret the random forest model uncovers new domain knowledge, such as the relationship between spatial patterns and stress concentration. This study theoretically validates the effectiveness of image data and effectively balances the predictive capability and interpretability of the model, facilitating knowledge discovery in the field. On a practical level, it also provides guidance for mine safety management.

AB  - This paper provides information on current certification of landing gear available for use in the aerospace industry. Moving forward, machine learning is part of structural health monitoring, which is being used by the aircraft industry. The non-deterministic nature of deep learning algorithms is regarded as a hurdle for certification and verification for use in the highly-regulated aerospace industry. This paper brings forth its regulation requirements and the emergence of standardisation efforts. To be able to validate machine learning for safety critical applications such as landing gear, the safe-life fatigue assessment needs to be certified such that the remaining useful life may be accurately predicted and trusted. A coverage of future certification for the usage of machine learning in safety-critical aerospace systems is provided, taking into consideration both the risk management and explainability for different end user categories involved in the certification process. Additionally, provisional use case scenarios are demonstrated, in which risk assessments and uncertainties are incorporated for the implementation of a proposed certification approach targeting offline machine learning models and their explainable usage for predicting the remaining useful life of landing gear systems based on the safe-life method.

AB  - As engineering endeavors push the boundaries of material and design capabilities, the significance of understanding and mitigating fatigue in construction materials becomes paramount. This study specifically investigates the low-cycle fatigue performance of reinforced high-strength concrete (RHSC). Using rigorous data collection, we established a clear link between interpretable machine learning analysis and the fatigue properties of RHSC. A trained model was developed, yielding a straightforward formula tailored to low-cycle fatigue design considerations for RHSC. This model stands as a testament to the potential for marrying traditional engineering practices with advanced statistical techniques. Our results emphasize that, when appropriately applied, regression analysis can be instrumental in enhancing the durability and longevity of RHSC structures exposed to dynamic loadings. This research not only underscores the pivotal role of statistical methods in fatigue design but also champions the broader adoption of such techniques in evolving engineering landscapes.

AB  - We propose Interpretable Generalized Additive Neural Networks (IGANN), a novel machine learning model that uses gradient boosting and tailored neural networks to obtain high predictive performance while being interpretable to humans. We derive an efficient training algorithm based on the theory of extreme learning machines, that allows reducing the training process to solving a sequence of regularized linear regressions. We analyze the algorithm theoretically, provide insights into the rate of change of so-called shape functions, and show that the computational complexity of the training process scales linearly with the number of samples in the training dataset. We implement IGANN in PyTorch, which allows the model to be trained on graphics processing units (GPUs) to speed up training. We demonstrate favorable results in a variety of numerical experiments and showcase IGANN's value in three real-world case studies for productivity prediction, credit scoring, and criminal recidivism prediction.

AB  - Rapid and disorderly urban expansion leads to productivity loss, habitat fragmentation, and reduced land marginal returns, hindering sustainable urban development. Scientific identification of land use conflicts (LUCs) and understanding their driving mechanisms are therefore essential for optimizing national territorial spatial patterns. In this study, we focused on Xiong'an New Area, a state-level new area, and identified four levels of conflict zones and sixteen types of LUCs from a "production-living-ecology" spatial perspective. By combining spatial heterogeneity analysis with interpretable machine learning, a novel integrated framework was developed to reveal the spatio-temporal evolutionary patterns of land use conflict intensity (LUCI) and its response to socioeconomic and natural factors. Results indicated that the share of medium- and high-conflict zones in Xiong'an New Area increased from 46 % to 74 % between 2010 and 2020, displaying clustered spatial distribution. LUC types were dominated by medium conflict among agricultural-construction-ecological land and high conflict between agricultural and ecological land. LUCI continuously increased, showing a spatial pattern of "high in the north and low in the south." Moreover, the relationships between LUCI and its factors were non-linear and exhibited threshold effects. Gross domestic product, normalized difference vegetation index, and distance from roads were the three most influential factors. Interactions among factors had a non-smooth impact on LUCI. This study offers decision support for optimizing land use patterns and mitigating LUCs in rapidly urbanizing areas.

AB  - Coastal salt marshes suffering from anthropogenic coastal development and sea level rise have attracted much attention because of their capacity for carbon sequestration and global climate change mitigation. Accurate mapping of coastal salt marshes is always the first step for their protection, management, and restoration. The inherent complexities of vegetation, dynamics of tides, and anthropogenic disturbances pose challenges for remote sensing-based approaches. Existing studies have utilized phenology information and various black-box algorithms to reduce misclassifications. However, the approaches with dual-temporal images containing phenology information have suffered from inefficiency; the misclassifications have been objectively postprocessed rather than considered in the method design, and the tacit knowledge of the trained black-box models has not been revealed. To address the above issues, we proposed a new approach with solid improvements in dual-temporal image construction, misclassification processing, and tacit knowledge analysis, including an efficient method to synthesize dual-temporal images based on the common divisor of the green-up season or senescence season resulting from latitudinal gradients in narrow coastal areas of China, a detailed classification scheme by interpretation of iteratively collected samples, and a key decision rule approximating the trained model. We applied the approach to Sentinel-1/2 images and DEM data, thus deriving a 10-m resolution coastal salt marsh map of China with an overall accuracy of 92.5%. A qualitative comparison showed that the map produced in this study was fitted well with actual salt marsh distributions, resulting in improved accuracy when compared to recently generated maps. The most important contribution is that the overall nature of the trained model observed from the training samples was approximated by a four-feature decision rule following the principle of explainable artificial intelligence, i.e., B8senescence/B4senescence < 2.06 & B4green/B8green < 0.78 & B12green/B11green < 0.72 & elevation < 2.13, and thus established a new potential classification mechanism for dual-temporal black-box algorithms, i.e., the water signal was covered up by flourishing vegetation, but the situation changed when vegetation withered. This study not only generates an accurate coastal salt marsh map at a national scale but also provides a classification mechanism for dual-temporal image-based coastal salt marsh identification and mapping.

AB  - Accurate estimation of terrestrial ecosystem respiration (TER) is essential for refining global carbon budgets. Current large-scale TER models rely on empirical structures derived from site-scale observations, often driven solely by hydrothermal factors. However, incorporating ecosystem-scale information is critical for more accurate large-scale TER modeling. Such ecosystem-scale variables have not been well parameterized, since the mechanisms by which they affect TER remain unclear. To address this gap, here we developed a Causality constrained Interpretable Machine Learning model for TER estimation (named "CIML-TER") which consider the ecosystem-scale information. CIML-TER exhibited higher estimation accuracy (reducing relative mean absolute error by approximately 15%) and overcame the "artificial discontinuities" phenomenon of traditional models. Meanwhile, we quantitatively revealed that although environmental factors, such as temperature and water, were still the dominant drivers of TER (contributing similar to 44.15% of global TER variability), biotic factors (e.g., vegetation structure, similar to 25.91%) and spatiotemporal variation factors (e.g., land cover and phenology, similar to 29.94%) were also critical.

AB  - Developing accurate and interpretable models to forecast concrete's self-healing behavior is of interest to material engineers, scientists, and civil engineering contractors. Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence are powerful tools that allow constructing high-precision predictions, yet often considered "black box" methods due to their complexity. Those approaches are commonly used for the modeling of mechanical properties of concrete with exceptional accuracy; however, there are few studies dealing with the application of ML for the self-healing of cementitious materials. This paper proposes a pioneering study on the utilization of ML for predicting post-fire self-healing of concrete. A large database is constructed based on the literature studies. Twelve input variables are analyzed: w/c, age of concrete, amount of cement, fine aggregate, coarse aggregate, peak loading temperature, duration of peak loading temperature, cooling regime, duration of cooling, curing regime, duration of curing, and specimen volume. The output of the model is the compressive strength recovery, being one of the self-healing efficiency indicators. Four ML methods are optimized and compared based on their performance error: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Regression Trees (RT), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Ensemble of Regression Trees (ET). Monte Carlo analysis is conducted to verify the stability of the selected model. All ML approaches demonstrate satisfying precision, twice as good as linear regression. The ET model is found to be the most optimal with the highest prediction accuracy and sufficient robustness. Model interpretation is performed using Partial Dependence Plots and Individual Conditional Expectation Plots. Temperature, curing regime, and amounts of aggregates are identified as the most significant predictors.

AB  - Vision-based online defect recognition can provide insights for laser welding quality control systems. Although the visual signal contains richer quality information than the one-dimensional signal, the quality features contained in the visual signal are more abstract. To improve the explainability of current convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for laser welding defect recognition (LWDR), a class activation mapping method based on multi-scale fusion features (CAM-MSFF) is proposed. In addition, a multi-scale features adaptive fusion method is proposed with three steps of feature squeeze, feature mapping, and feature recalibrating. In order to facilitate the learning and utilization of multi-scale features by the proposed method, supervisory information is applied to multiple scales. The experimental results show that the proposed CAM-MSFF method has higher accuracy and convergence speed than the conventional model. The results of the explainability tests show that the proposed method can provide a more accurate and human-comprehensible explanation of the model & x2019;s decision basis.

AB  - Medical insurance fraud detection is crucial for minimizing the depletion of insurance pools. While medical expense records (MER) are valuable for this task, their limited availability is often overlooked. Extant studies directly input MER into high-dimensional machine learning (ML) models to achieve fraud detection. Another class of models generates fraud prediction based on probability modelling of samples. To explore whether these two different classes of models can cross-fertilizer each other, this paper incorporates Bayesian network (BN) into extreme gradient boosting (XGB). After obtaining the healthcare fraud predictions, this study employs these results to risk management decisions for minimizing the cost of Medical Insurance Bureaus. To make the optimal cost-based decision, we develop an instance-dependent cost-sensitive XGB (ICXGB) method. Using real-world data, we construct various variables based on the famous Recency, Frequency and Monetary (RFM) principle and empirically assess the prediction performance of probabilistic model and ML. The integrative model shows a significant improvement over BN and ICXGB. Finally, a post-hoc explanation method is adopted to quantify the contributions of the predictors and obtain some management implications.

AB  - Shield tunnel segment uplift is a common phenomenon in construction. Excessive and unstable uplift will affect tunnel quality and safety seriously, shorten the tunnel life, and is not conducive to the sustainable management of the tunnel's entire life cycle. However, segment uplift is affected by many factors, and it is challenging to predict the uplift amount and determine its cause accurately. Existing research mainly focuses on analyzing uplift factors and the uplift trend features for specific projects, which is difficult to apply to actual projects directly. This paper sorts out the influencing factors of segment uplift and designs a spatial-temporal data fusion mechanism for prediction. On this basis, we extract the key influencing factors of segment uplift, construct a prediction model of segment uplift amount based on Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) v2.0.3, and use SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) v0.44.0 to locate factors affecting uplift, forming an Auxiliary Decision-making System for Segment Uplift Control (ADS-SUC). An ADS-SUC not only detects the sudden change of the segment uplift successfully and predicts the segment uplift in practical engineering accurately, it also provides a feasible method to control the uplift in time, which is of great significance for reducing the construction risk of the tunnel project and ensuring the quality of the completed tunnel.

AB  - Using survey data from three dwelling types in Jakarta, we examine how dwelling type, socioeconomic identity, and commuting distance affect women's travel-mode choices and motivations behind women's choices for nearby and distant non-working trips. We compared the performance of the multinomial logit (MNL) model with two machine-learning classifiers, random forest (RF) and XGBoost, using Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) for interpretation. The models' efficacy varies across different datasets, with XGBoost mostly outperforming other models. The women's preferred commuting modes varied by dwelling type and trip purpose, but their motives for choosing the nearest activity were similar. Over half of the women rely on private motorized vehicles, with women living in the gated community heavily relying on private cars. For nearby shopping trips, low income and young age discourage women in urban villages (kampungs) and apartment complexes from walking. Women living in gated communities often choose private cars to fulfill household responsibilities, enabling them to access distant options. For nearby leisure, longer commutes discourage walking except for residents of apartment complexes. Car ownership and household responsibilities increase private car use for distant options. SHAP analysis offers practitioners insights into identifying key variables affecting travel-mode choice to design effective targeted interventions that address women's mobility needs.

AB  - The increasing availability of complex, geo-referenced on-farm data demands analytical frameworks that can guide crop management recommendations. Recent developments in interpretable machine learning techniques offer opportunities to use these methods in agronomic studies. Our objectives were two-fold: (1) to assess the performance of different machine learning methods to explain on-farm wheat yield variability in the North-western Indo-Gangetic Plains of India, and (2) to identify the most important drivers and interactions explaining wheat yield variability. A suite of fine-tuned machine learning models (ridge and lasso regression, classification and regression trees, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machines, gradient boosting, extreme gradient boosting, and random forest) were statistically compared using the R2, root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). The best performing model was again fine-tuned using a grid search approach for the bias-variance trade-off. Three post-hoc model agnostic techniques were used to interpret the best performing model: variable importance (a variable was considered "important " if shuffling its values increased or decreased the model error considerably), interaction strength (based on Friedman's H-statistic), and two-way interaction (i.e., how much of the total variability in wheat yield was explained by a particular two-way interaction). Model outputs were compared against empirical data to contextualize results and provide a blueprint for future analysis in other production systems. Tree-based and decision boundary-based methods outperformed regression-based methods in explaining wheat yield variability. Random forest was the best performing method in terms of goodness-of-fit and model precision and accuracy with RMSE, MAE, and R2 ranging between 367 and 470 kg ha-1, 276-345 kg ha-1, and 0.44-0.63, respectively. Random forest was then used for selection of important variables and in-teractions. The most important management variables explaining wheat yield variability were nitrogen appli-cation rate and crop residue management, whereas the average of monthly cumulative solar radiation during February and March (coinciding with reproductive phase of wheat) was the most important biophysical variable. The effect size of these variables on wheat yield ranged between 227 kg ha-1 for nitrogen application rate to 372 kg ha-1 for cumulative solar radiation during February and March. The effect of important interactions on wheat yield was detected in the data namely the interaction between crop residue management and disease manage-ment and, nitrogen application rate and seeding rate. For instance, farmers' fields with moderate disease inci-dence yielded 750 kg ha-1 less when crop residues were removed than when crop residues were retained. Similarly, wheat yield response to residue retention was higher under low seed and N application rates. As an inductive research approach, the appropriate application of interpretable machine learning methods can be used to extract agronomically actionable information from large-scale farmer field data.

AB  - Industry 5.0 is a emerging transformative model that aims to develop a hyperconnected, automated, and data-driven industrial ecosystem. This digital transformation will boost productivity and efficiency throughout the production process but will be more prone to new sophisticated cyber-attacks. Deep learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have the potential to recognize intrusions with high accuracy. However, these models are complex and are treated as a black box by developers and security analysts due to the inability to interpret the decisions made by these models. Motivated by the challenges, this paper presents an explainable and resilient IDS for Industry 5.0. The proposed IDS is designed by combining bidirectional long short-term memory networks (BiLSTM), a bidirectional-gated recurrent unit (Bi-GRU), fully connected layers and a softmax classifier to enhance the intrusion detection process in Industry 5.0. We employ the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) mechanism to interpret and understand the features that contributed the most in the decision of the proposed cyber-resilient IDS. The evaluation of the proposed model using the explainability can ensure that the model is working as expected. The experimental results based on the CICDDoS2019 dataset confirms the superiority of the proposed IDS over some recent approaches.

AB  - Deep learning based methods hold state-of-the-art results in low-level image processing tasks, but remain difficult to interpret due to their black-box construction. Unrolled optimization networks present an interpretable alternative to constructing deep neural networks by deriving their architecture from classical iterative optimization methods without use of tricks from the standard deep learning tool-box. So far, such methods have demonstrated performance close to that of state-of-the-art models while using their interpretable construction to achieve a comparably low learned parameter count. In this work, we propose an unrolled convolutional dictionary learning network (CDLNet) and demonstrate its competitive denoising and joint denoising and demosaicing (JDD) performance both in low and high parameter count regimes. Specifically, we show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art fully convolutional denoising and JDD models when scaled to a similar parameter count. In addition, we leverage the model's interpretable construction to propose a noise-adaptive parameterization of thresholds in the network that enables state-of-the-art blind denoising performance, and near-perfect generalization on noise-levels unseen during training. Furthermore, we show that such performance extends to the JDD task and unsupervised learning.

AB  - Accurate prediction of dam displacement is essential for structural safety and risk management. To comprehensively address the "accuracy-uncertainty-interpretability" trilemma in dam displacement prediction, this study proposes a deep learning framework that integrates Patch Time Series Transformer (PatchTST), Sand Cat Swarm Optimization (SCSO), Quantile Regression (QR), and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). The proposed framework first employs PatchTST to capture the nonlinear temporal dependencies between multiple monitoring factors and dam displacement, while SCSO is utilized to adaptively optimize key hyperparameters, enabling the construction of a high-precision point prediction model. On this basis, QR is introduced to model the distributional uncertainty of displacement responses and to generate confidence-based prediction intervals, facilitating the evaluation of displacement anomalies. Furthermore, SHAP is incorporated to quantify the marginal contribution of each input factor to the model outputs, thereby enhancing interpretability and aligning model behavior with physical domain knowledge. The framework is validated using multi-year monitoring data from a double-curvature arch dam located in Southwest China. Comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms five well-established machine learning methods and the traditional linear regression method in terms of point prediction accuracy, reliability of interval estimation, and false alarm rate, exhibiting strong generalization and robustness. The SHAP-based analysis further reveals that water pressure variations and seasonal temperature cycles are the dominant factors influencing radial displacement, consistent with known structural deformation mechanisms. These findings affirm the physical consistency and engineering applicability of the proposed framework, offering a deployable and trustworthy solution for intelligent dam health monitoring and uncertainty-aware forecasting in safety-critical infrastructures.

AB  - Personal thermal comfort affects occupants' health, well-being, and productivity. Its satisfaction is subjective, based on individual characteristics and dynamic environments, and challenging to understand, requiring predicted outcomes and explanations of how and why the outcomes happen. This research fulfills this concern using a personal thermal comfort model based on causal artificial intelligence. It encodes personal thermal comfort satisfaction based on a new causal-and-effect framework to connect the human mind and environmental factors. Random variables encode relevant factors, and the structural causal model performs cause-and-effect relationships. The do-calculus (e.g., d-separated and d-connected) draws the common sense of the model based on causal structure representation, contributing to a human-intelligent understanding. A directed acyclic graph and exact-inference-based variable elimination quantify the model parameters based on real-world observational data. The strength of causal relationships is verified based on causal odd ratio, causal sensitivity, and causal impact. The results highlight that our proposed model can encode physiological and physical factors to predict and explain personal thermal comfort satisfaction. It can predict and explain such satisfaction reasonably and robustly, converging to human-like interpretation. It can be applied to intelligent systems to understand personal thermal comfort.

AB  - Soil erosion poses a significant threat to sustainable land management and agricultural productivity. Addressing this issue requires advanced predictive models that can accurately identify areas at risk and inform soil conservation strategies. This study focuses on the development and interpretation of well-optimized deep learning (DL) models to predict soil erosion probability, aiming to enhance decision-making in land management. Utilizing the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) in conjunction with ground-truthing, we identified critical erosion-prone areas. To predict soil erosion probability, we employed Bayesian optimization to fine-tune Deep Neural Network (DNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN), and DNN-CNN hybrid models. These DL models were verified using a set of metrics. SHAP value analysis as a means of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) was used to interpret these DL models for better decision-making. RUSLE estimations and ground truthing highlight that Soil erosion rates in the northeastern and northwestern regions are nearing the highest observed at 25 tonnes per hectare annually, largely due to steep slopes and limited vegetation. In contrast, the southern and southeastern areas have lower erosion rates, due to denser vegetation and gentler slopes. Deep learning models, optimized using Bayesian methods, demonstrate high performance in spatially modeling soil erosion probability. The DNN model achieved an accuracy of 0.93, a precision of 0.92, and an F1-score of 0.94, identifying 222.73 sq. km as highly susceptible to erosion, which indicates its strong ability to detect true erosion events. The CNN model identified 49.68% of the study area (503.30 sq. km) as high-risk, with an accuracy of 0.90 and a precision of 0.91. The FCNN model showed a balanced risk distribution, indicating 37.04% of the land (375.25 sq. km) as very low risk and 36.43% (369.11 sq. km) as very high risk, with an accuracy of 0.91. The DNN-CNN hybrid model highlighted 41.58% of the area (421.20 sq. km) as high risk, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing spatial patterns of erosion susceptibility. SHAP value analysis indicates that land use and soil type (LULC and K-factor) are crucial in erosion predictions, with LULC having a significant predictive influence in the DNN model. These insights facilitate the prioritization of soil conservation measures, enabling decision-makers to focus on the most impactful factors for mitigating soil erosion.

AB  - The ability to predict the drift capacity of reinforced concrete structural walls is critical to the seismic design process. The accuracy of such predictions has implications for construction costs, seismic safety, and reliability. However, the inability of an empirical model to capture any nonlinearity that exists between the drift capacity and different influencing variables can negatively impact the predictive performance. This study proposes a drift capacity prediction model for special structural walls based on the extreme gradient boosting machine-learning algorithm and a data set of 164 special boundary element wall tests. The efficiency of the proposed model is evaluated using a nested cross-validation approach, and the results reveal its superior predictive capabilities relative to the empirical equation adopted in ACI 318-19. To overcome the lack of interpretability of the model, SHapley Additive exPlanations are used to examine the relative individual and interactive effects of the different input variables on the drift capacity.

AB  - Frozen and thawed meat plays an important role in stabilizing the meat supply chain and extending the shelf life of meat. However, traditional methods of research and development (R&D) struggle to meet rising demands for quality, nutritional value, innovation, safety, production efficiency, and sustainability. Frozen and thawed meat faces specific challenges, including quality degradation during thawing. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising solution to tackle these challenges in R&D of frozen and thawed meat. AI's capabilities in perception, judgment, and execution demonstrate significant potential in problem-solving and task execution. This review outlines the architecture of applying AI technology to the R&D of frozen and thawed meat, aiming to make AI better implement and deliver solutions. In comparison to traditional R&D methods, the current research progress and promising application prospects of AI in this field are comprehensively summarized, focusing on its role in addressing key challenges such as rapid optimization of thawing process. AI has already demonstrated success in areas such as product development, production optimization, risk management, and quality control for frozen and thawed meat. In the future, AI-based R&D for frozen and thawed meat will also play an important role in promoting personalization, intelligent production, and sustainable development. However, challenges remain, including the need for high-quality data, complex implementation, volatile processes, and environmental considerations. To realize the full potential of AI that can be integrated into R&D of frozen and thawed meat, further research is needed to develop more robust and reliable AI solutions, such as general AI, explainable AI, and green AI.

AB  - Floods are among the most destructive natural hazards globally, necessitating the identification of flood-prone areas for effective disaster risk management and sustainable urban development. Advanced data-driven techniques, including machine learning (ML), are increasingly used to map and mitigate flood risks. However, ML applications for flood risk assessment remain limited in Sorocaba, a sub-region of S & atilde;o Paulo, Brazil. This study employs four ML algorithms-differential evolution (DE), na & iuml;ve Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), and support vector machines (SVMs)-to develop flood susceptibility models using 16 predictor variables. Key categorical factors influencing flood susceptibility included topographical, anthropogenic, and hydrometeorological, particularly elevation, slope, NDVI, NDWI, and distance to roads. Performance metrics (F1-score and AUC) showed strong results, ranging from 0.94 to 1.00, with the DE and RF models excelling in training, testing, and external datasets. The study highlights model transferability, demonstrating applicability to other regions. Findings reveal that 41% to 50% of Sorocaba is at high flood risk. The explainable artificial intelligence technique Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) further identified moisture and the stream power index (SPI) as significant factors influencing flood occurrence. The study underscores the ML-based model's potential in highlighting flood-vulnerable areas and guiding flood mitigation strategies, land-use planning, and infrastructure resilience.

AB  - Drought ranks among the costliest of all climate-related phenomena and manifests in various forms, posing significant challenges in understanding its influence on agriculture and natural ecosystems. Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA), a significant region of tropical agriculture and vegetation ecosystems, has become increasingly susceptible to drought hazards. In this study, we characterized and assessed vegetation dynamics and their drought impacts using correlation analysis and explainable machine learning methods under different vegetation types and elevation zones during the dry growing seasons from 2000 to 2022. Specifically, we characterized the vegetation dynamics and their trend in space and time. Next, we assessed vegetation-drought responses in consideration of meteorological, hydrological, and agricultural droughts under different land cover types and elevation characteristics. Lastly, we used an explainable machine learning method to quantify the drivers and impacts of multifaceted droughts on natural and undisturbed vegetation ecosystems. Our findings revealed that nearly 70% of the MSEA region experienced a greening trend despite large areas of vegetative damage during the drought years. Vietnam witnessed increasing vegetation condition in most observed years while the declining trend was mainly found in Cambodia and southern Laos. Vegetation-drought responses showed that tropical vegetation had a high sensitivity to drought conditions, and stronger responses were observed in rainfed crop, mixed forest, and deciduous forest at lower altitude areas. In natural and undisturbed ecosystems, short-term meteorological and agricultural drought disturbances accounted for nearly 93% of variations in tropical vegetation. Among the different examined drought indices, the 3-month Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration (SPEI-3) and Temperature Condition Index (TCI) were identified as the factors having the largest influence, together explaining about 55% of the observed natural undisturbed vegetation variations. These findings deepen our understanding of tropical vegetation-drought responses and the underlying drivers of natural and undisturbed ecosystems. Such insights could provide valuable information to assist national and local governments in the MSEA region in developing effective drought management and adaptation programs to safeguard tropical agricultural production and natural ecosystems amidst growing climate challenges.

AB  - The dynamic nature and increasing complexity of the construction industry have led to increased conflicts in construction projects. An accurate prediction of the outcome of a dispute resolution in courts could effectively reduce the number of disputes that would otherwise conclude by spending more money through litigation. This study aims to introduce a two-layered fuzzy logic model for predicting court decisions in construction contract disputes. 100 cases of construction contract disputes are selected from the courts of Iran. A questionnaire survey is then conducted to extract a set of fuzzy rules for identifying important decision parameters and expert knowledge. Accordingly, a two-layered fuzzy logic-based decision-making architecture is proposed for the prediction model. Furthermore, the fuzzy system is trained based on 10-fold cross-validation. Analysis of results indicates that 51 out of the 100 cases are filed after the dissolution and termination of the contract show a significant impact of these clauses as the root cause in construction contract disputes. Our results present a proposed hierarchical fuzzy system that can correctly predict nearly 60% of the test data. Also, we demonstrate a methodology of using argument before ML to establish interpretable AI models. Based on our findings, a fuzzy model with a hierarchical structure may be used as a simple and efficient method for predicting court decisions in construction contract disputes.

AB  - Wildfires significantly disrupt the physical and hydrologic conditions of the environment, leading to vegetation loss and altered surface geo-material properties. These complex dynamics promote post-fire gully erosion, yet the key conditioning factors (e.g., topography, hydrology) remain insufficiently understood. This study proposes a novel artificial intelligence (AI) framework that integrates four machine learning (ML) models with Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method, offering a hierarchical perspective from global to local on the dominant factors controlling gully distribution in wildfire-affected areas. In a case study of Xiangjiao catchment burned on March 28, 2020, in Muli County in Sichuan Province of Southwest China, we derived 21 geoenvironmental factors to assess the susceptibility of post-fire gully erosion using logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and convolutional neural network (CNN) models. SHAP-based model interpretation revealed eight key conditioning factors: topographic position index (TPI), topographic wetness index (TWI), distance to stream, mean annual precipitation, differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR), land use/cover, soil type, and distance to road. Comparative model evaluation demonstrated that reduced-variable models incorporating these dominant factors achieved accuracy comparable to that of the initial-variable models, with AUC values exceeding 0.868 across all ML algorithms. These findings provide critical insights into gully erosion behavior in wildfire-affected areas, supporting the decision-making process behind environmental management and hazard mitigation.

AB  - Background Elderly patients are more likely to suffer from severe ischemic stroke (IS) and have worse outcomes, including death and disability. We aimed to develop and validate predictive models using novel machine learning algorithms for the 3-month mortality in elderly patients with IS admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study. Data were extracted from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV and International Stroke Perfusion Imaging Registry (INSPIRE) database. Ten machine learning algorithms including Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network (NN), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNNs), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Naive Bayes (NB), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Logistic Regression (LR) were used to build the models. Performance was measured using area under the curve (AUC) and accuracy. Finally, interpretable machine learning (IML) models presenting as Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) values were applied for mortality risk prediction.Results A total of 1826 elderly patients with IS admitted to the ICU were included in the analysis, of whom 624 (34.2%) died, and endovascular treatment was performed in 244 patients. After feature selection, a total of eight variables, including minimum Glasgow Coma Scale values, albumin, lactate dehydrogenase, age, alkaline phosphatase, body mass index, platelets, and types of surgery, were finally used for model construction. The AUCs of the CatBoost model were 0.737 in the testing set and 0.709 in the external validation set. The Brier scores in the training set and testing set were 0.12 and 0.21, respectively. The IML of the CatBoost model was performed based on the SHAP value and the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations method.Conclusion The CatBoost model had the best predictive performance for predicting mortality in elderly patients with IS admitted to the ICU. The IML model would further aid in clinical decision-making and timely healthcare services by the early identification of high-risk patients.

AB  - Background In the process of finding the causative variant of rare diseases, accurate assessment and prioritization of genetic variants is essential. Previous variant prioritization tools mainly depend on the in-silico prediction of the pathogenicity of variants, which results in low sensitivity and difficulty in interpreting the prioritization result. In this study, we propose an explainable algorithm for variant prioritization, named 3ASC, with higher sensitivity and ability to annotate evidence used for prioritization. 3ASC annotates each variant with the 28 criteria defined by the ACMG/AMP genome interpretation guidelines and features related to the clinical interpretation of the variants. The system can explain the result based on annotated evidence and feature contributions.Results We trained various machine learning algorithms using in-house patient data. The performance of variant ranking was assessed using the recall rate of identifying causative variants in the top-ranked variants. The best practice model was a random forest classifier that showed top 1 recall of 85.6% and top 3 recall of 94.4%. The 3ASC annotates the ACMG/AMP criteria for each genetic variant of a patient so that clinical geneticists can interpret the result as in the CAGI6 SickKids challenge. In the challenge, 3ASC identified causal genes for 10 out of 14 patient cases, with evidence of decreased gene expression for 6 cases. Among them, two genes (HDAC8 and CASK) had decreased gene expression profiles confirmed by transcriptome data.Conclusions 3ASC can prioritize genetic variants with higher sensitivity compared to previous methods by integrating various features related to clinical interpretation, including features related to false positive risk such as quality control and disease inheritance pattern. The system allows interpretation of each variant based on the ACMG/AMP criteria and feature contribution assessed using explainable AI techniques.

AB  - Current machine learning models under artificial intelligence can only improve prediction accuracy, but their underlying logic remains incomprehensible. Therefore, to provide high prediction accuracy and enhance the interpretability of the model through machine learning, the study selects the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model by comparing multiple models under single learner and integrated learning. Then a cancer probability statistical prediction model is constructed through parameter optimization, and its performance and interpretability are analyzed. The experimental results showed that the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Area under Curve (AUC) value in the single learner was generally lower than 80%, while the AUC value was 84.4%, surpassing that of the comparison model. Simultaneously, an increase in Alpha-Fetoprotein value greater than 13.5 had a stronger predictive effect when combined with other factors. Smaller serum Alanine Aminotransferase and Alpha-Fetoprotein assay near 0 may produce negative or positive effects, whereas a higher value is more likely to produce a positive effect. This is in line with its clinical significance. Overall, XGBoost effectively improves the out-of-sample prediction accurate and interpretability, which is significant for the actual liver cancer diagnosis prediction.

AB  - The sustainable development of the construction industry necessitates the utilization of multipurpose Cement Composites (CC). Therefore, the integration of nanomaterials has the potential to provide CC that exhibits superior performance and possesses several functionalities. Hence, the use of Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) inside the concrete cementitious sector holds significant potential for implementing effective solutions toward creating a sustainable ecosystem characterized by versatile attributes. Nevertheless, the prediction of the characteristics of these composites is a significant challenge owing to their complex composite structure and non-linear response. Furthermore, the process of designing and executing experimental trials on diverse samples and across various age groups is arduous, time-consuming, and financially burdensome. There is currently a dearth of a predictive model capable of estimating the compressive strength of concrete including nanoparticles. The utilization of such models is of significant importance in the project and study of Reinforced Concrete (RC) structures including nanoparticles. Three machine learning algorithms, including Gene Expression Programming (GEP), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), were utilized in this study to forecast the Compressive Strength (CS) of nanocomposites that incorporate CNTs. The evaluation of the models' reliability was conducted by the utilization of cross-validation with K-folding and subsequent statistical error analysis. According to the results of the coefficient of determination (R2), the XGB model achieved the highest R2 value (0.95), while the GB model and GEP model both earned R2 values of 0.94. Furthermore, the validation method for the models included the implementation of statistical analysis and k-fold cross-validation. Therefore, the XGB model exhibited much lower values for statistical metrics compared to the GEP and GB models. In addition, a GEP empirical equation and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) have been created for practical applications in predicting the strength of concrete. This streamlines the procedure and provides a valuable instrument for harnessing the model's potential in the field of civil engineering. Furthermore, the use of Shapley analysis is conducted to assess the predominant factors in concrete prediction. The findings of this research indicate that the curing time, type of cement, and water-to-cement ratio significantly influence the properties of CNT-based concrete composites.

AB  - The grassland ecosystem of the Mongolian Plateau is a significant carbon sink and highly sensitive to environmental changes. Monitoring gross primary productivity (GPP), net primary productivity (NPP), and carbon use efficiency (CUE), along with their responses to climate changes, is essential for accurate carbon budgeting and forecasting. Our study, conducted from 2000 to 2018, we observed fluctuating yet upward trends in NPP, GPP and CUE across the grasslands, indicating an increased potential for carbon sequestration, while the spatial distribution of NPP and GPP showed a notable increasing trend from the west to the east. By employing an interpretable machine learning approach, we correlated GPP, NPP and CUE with key climatic variables-air temperature, precipitation, soil moisture (SM), and solar radiation (SR)-and quantified their individual impacts. Our findings reveal that GPP, NPP, and CUE in grasslands are positively influenced by precipitation and SM, but negatively by air temperature and SR. Precipitation contributes 50.14% to GPP and 49.63% to NPP, while SM contributes 19.3% to GPP and 18.18% to NPP. In the case of CUE, SM is the predominant factor, affecting 28.3 % of the area, followed by air temperature, which affects 27.94 % of the area. In contrast, precipitation and SM have a comparatively lesser impact on CUE, affecting 24.88 % and 18.84% of the area, respectively. The findings of this research are extremely important for gaining a thorough understanding of the carbon cycle response mechanism of grassland vegetation in dry and semi-arid regions in the context of climate change.

AB  - To retrospectively develop and validate an interpretable deep learning model and nomogram utilizing endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) images to predict pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs). Following confirmation via pathological examination, a retrospective analysis was performed on a cohort of 266 patients, comprising 115 individuals diagnosed with PNETs and 151 with pancreatic cancer. These patients were randomly assigned to the training or test group in a 7:3 ratio. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm was employed to reduce the dimensionality of deep learning (DL) features extracted from pre-standardized EUS images. The retained nonzero coefficient features were subsequently applied to develop predictive eight DL models based on distinct machine learning algorithms. The optimal DL model was identified and used to establish a clinical signature, which subsequently informed the construction and evaluation of a nomogram. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) were implemented to interpret and visualize the model outputs. A total of 2048 DL features were initially extracted, from which only 27 features with coefficients greater than zero were retained. The support vector machine (SVM) DL model demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.948 and 0.795 in the training and test groups, respectively. Additionally, a nomogram was developed, incorporating both DL and clinical signatures, and was visually represented for practical application. Finally, the calibration curves, decision curve analysis (DCA) plots, and clinical impact curves (CIC) exhibited by the DL model and nomogram indicated high accuracy. The application of Grad-CAM and SHAP enhanced the interpretability of these models. These methodologies contributed substantial net benefits to clinical decision-making processes. A novel interpretable DL model and nomogram were developed and validated using EUS images, cooperating with machine learning algorithms. This approach demonstrates significant potential for enhancing the clinical applicability of EUS in predicting PNETs from pancreatic cancer, thereby offering valuable insights for future research and implementation.

AB  - Climate change perturbations contribute to the alteration of ecosystem functions and the reduction of their resilience. Understanding this reduction in resilience is fundamental for formulating strategies for sustainable ecosystem management. Consequently, a systematic evaluation of factors influencing ecosystem resilience is imperative. This involves elucidating the resilience trends and stress conditions within Chinese ecosystems spatially, thereby enabling a holistic assessment of their health status. This study assesses resilience across China by analyzing the one-month lagged time autocorrelation of terrestrial Gross Primary Production (GPP) across China. It differentiates between various stress states within the study region and employs interpretable machine learning methods to examine the relationship between terrestrial ecosystem resilience and environmental changes under different stress conditions. The findings reveal that approximately 20 % of Chinese regions are undergoing a decrease in ecosystem resilience, with over half experiencing stressed conditions. This is particularly pronounced in the northeastern and central regions of China, where a more significant and widespread decrease in resilience is observed. In the stressed areas of China, the effect of each environmental factor on the decrease in resilience is greater, where attention needs to be paid to areas with higher maximum temperature, precipitation, vapor pressure deficit, and radiation. The study highlights the variability in ecosystem resilience under different environmental conditions and their varied responses to environmental changes. This provides a scientific basis for protecting ecological balance and promoting the sustainable development of ecosystems.

AB  - This study developed an ensemble-learning-based bridge deck defect condition prediction model to help bridge managers make more rational and informed steel bridge deck maintenance decisions. Using the latest data from the NBI database for 2021, this study first used ADASYN to solve imbalance problems in the data, then built six ensemble learning models (RandomForest, ExtraTree, AdaBoost, GBDT, XGBoost, and LightGBM) and used a grid search method to determine the hyperparameters of the models. The optimal model was finally analyzed using the interpretable machine learning framework, SHAP. The results show that the optimal model is XGBoost, with an accuracy of 0.9495, an AUC of 0.9026, and an F1-Score of 0.9740. The most important factor affecting the condition of steel bridge deck defects is the condition of the bridge's superstructure. In contrast, the condition of the bridge substructure and the year of bridge construction are relatively minor factors.

AB  - The decision to accept a deceased donor organ offer for transplant, or wait for something potentially better in the future, can be challenging. Clinical decision support tools predicting transplant outcomes are lacking. This project uses interpretable methods to predict both graft failure and patient death using data from previously accepted kidney transplant offers. Using more than 25 years of transplant outcome data, we train and compare several survival analysis models in single risk settings. In addition, we use post hoc interpretability techniques to clinically validate these models. Neural networks show comparable performance to the Cox proportional hazard model, with concordance of 0.63 and 0.79 for prediction of graft failure and patient death, respectively. Donor and recipient ages, the number of mismatches at DR locus, dialysis type, and primary renal disease appear to be important features for transplant outcome prediction. Owing to their good predictive performance and the clinical relevance of their post hoc interpretation, neural networks represent a promising core component in the construction of future decision support systems for transplant offering.

AB  - The paper deals with the construction of interpretable machine learning models. The approximation problem is solved for a set of shapes on a contour image. Assumptions that the shapes are second-order curves are introduced. When approximating the shapes, information about the type, location, and shape of curves as well as about the set of their possible transformations is used. Such information is called expert information, and the machine learning method based on expert information is called expert-augmented learning. It is assumed that the set of shapes is approximated by the set of local models. Each local model based on expert information approximates one shape on the contour image. To construct the models, it is proposed to map second-order curves into a feature space in which each local model is linear. Thus, second-order curves are approximated by a set of linear models. In a computational experiment, the problem of approximating an iris on a contour image is considered.

TI  - Interpreting machine learning of topological quantum phase transitions
T2  - PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH
LA  - English
AB  - There has been growing excitement over the possibility of employing artificial neural networks (ANNs) to gain new theoretical insight into the physics of quantum many-body problems. "Interpretability" remains a concern: can we understand the basis for the ANN's decision-making criteria in order to inform our theoretical understanding? "Interpretable" machine learning in quantum matter has to date been restricted to linear models, such as support vector machines, due to the greater difficulty of interpreting nonlinear ANNs. Here we consider topological quantum phase transitions in models of Chern insulator, Z(2) topological insulator, and Z(2) quantum spin liquid, each using a shallow fully connected feed-forward ANN. The use of quantum loop topography, a "domain knowledge"-guided approach to feature selection, facilitates the construction of faithful phase diagrams and semiquantitative interpretation of the criteria in certain cases. To identify the topological phases, the ANNs learn physically meaningful features, such as topological invariants and deconfinement of loops. The interpretability in these cases suggests hope for theoretical progress based on future uses of ANN-based machine learning on quantum many-body problems.

AB  - This study proposes a theoretical framework for dynamic destination competitiveness (DD-TDC) by integrating digital empowerment and dynamic governance mechanisms. Using data on the competitiveness of 119 destinations from the World Economic Forum (2018-2023), the Interpretable Random Forest Model and SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis was conducted to explore the drivers of competitiveness during crisis and non-crisis periods. The findings reveal that (1) Policy factors exhibit a short-term dominant effect on competitiveness through dynamic governance mechanisms during the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) in the long term, infrastructure is the most significant driver of competitiveness, followed by tourism resources and the business environment, while policy and sustainability contribute relatively less; and (3) the long-term impact of COVID-19 on destination competitiveness is limited. This study validates the dynamic adaptability of the DD-TDC model and provides methodological insights for destination managers to address crises and build sustainable competitiveness. The results have valuable implications for both academic research and practical destination management strategies.

AB  - We examine "conversational receptiveness" - the use of language to communicate one's willingness to thoughtfully engage with opposing views. We develop an interpretable machine-learning algorithm to identify the linguistic profile of receptiveness (Studies 1A-B). We then show that in contentious policy discussions, government executives who were rated as more receptive - according to our algorithm and their partners, but not their own self-evaluations - were considered better teammates, advisors, and workplace representatives (Study 2). Furthermore, using field data from a setting where conflict management is endemic to productivity, we show that conversational receptiveness at the beginning of a conversation forestalls conflict escalation at the end. Specifically, Wikipedia editors who write more receptive posts are less prone to receiving personal attacks from disagreeing editors (Study 3). We develop a "receptiveness recipe" intervention based on our algorithm. We find that writers who follow the recipe are seen as more desirable partners for future collaboration and their messages are seen as more persuasive (Study 4). Overall, we find that conversational receptiveness is reliably measurable, has meaningful relational consequences, and can be substantially improved using our intervention.

AB  - As a key ecological parameter, NPP measures the photosynthetic efficiency of plants in capturing atmospheric carbon. With the warming of the climate, extreme temperature events are frequent, which has exerted a profound influence on NPP. Previous studies on the drivers of NPP have predominantly relied on linear approaches. This study innovatively employs deep neural networks (DNN) integrated with SHAP method, integrating nationwide daily meteorological data (2001-2020) and MODIS annual NPP products, to establish the first quantitative causal linkages between extreme temperature events and NPP dynamics across China. The findings indicate that: (1) The study period witnessed a pronounced increase in both occurrence rates and severity of extreme heat events across China, contrasted by a distinct decrease in extreme cold episodes, with notable regional variations in these trends. (2) NPP exhibits a distinct southeast-to-northwest decreasing gradient across China, and from 2001 to 2020, NPP in most parts of China showed an upward trend, but NPP in some mountainous and hilly areas in the south decreased slightly. (3) Regional analyses reveal contrasting NPP responses to temperature extremes. In southern region and Tibetan Plateau region, NPP shows a positive association with elevated temperature extremes, while moderate low temperature is more conducive to vegetation growth in northern region. (4) The DNN model constructed in this study performs better (R-2 approximate to 0.89) than other models in simulating the spatiotemporal distribution of NPP in China. The SHAP analysis identifies frost days and annual precipitation as the primary drivers of NPP variation across China, with most factors exhibiting threshold-dependent effects on NPP.

AB  - Tomatoes are globally valued for their nutritional benefits and unique taste, playing a crucial role in agricultural productivity. Accurate diagnosis of tomato leaf diseases is vital to avoid ineffective treatments that can harm plants and ecosystems. While deep learning models excel in classifying these diseases, distinguishing subtle variations remains challenging. This study introduces XSE-TomatoNet, an enhanced version of EfficientNetB0, incorporating Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks and multi-scale feature fusion to boost classification performance. XSE-TomatoNet extracts multi-scale features, refines them with SE blocks, and merges them through Global Average Pooling, providing detailed and broad insights for precise disease classification. Our approach achieves an impressive accuracy of 99.11%, with 99% precision and recall, outperforming models like MobileNet and VGG19, especially when combined with data augmentation and ablation studies. The model achieved an average training accuracy of 99.41% and a validation accuracy of 98.88% in 10-fold cross-validation, showing strong generalization to unseen data. We also used LIME and SHAP for model interpretability, offering insights into the decision-making process, and employed Grad-CAM and Grad-CAM ++ to visually highlight key areas in leaf images. Finally, the best model was integrated into a web-based system for practical use by tomato cultivators. center dot XSE-TomatoNet is an enhanced version of EfficientNetB0 which incorporates Squeeze-and- Excitation (SE) blocks and multi-scale feature fusion. center dot XSE-TomatoNet outperformed MobileNet (87.44%) and VGG-19 (95.50%), in terms of accuracy, achieving 99.41%. center dot Integration of interpretation using LIME and SHAP models gives higher level understanding of the diseases and employment of Grad-CAM and Grad-CAM ++ shows visual representation of the diseased leaves.

AB  - Forecasting fluid flow in subsurface resources such as groundwater, geothermal, and oil and gas is essential to maximize project economics and maximize resource recovery. We propose a novel workflow for a data -driven surrogate flow model for subsurface forecasting using an attention-based deep neural network architecture. The proposed workflow allows the inclusion of static and dynamic predictor features and forecasting across multiple wells with low error predictions. The study reveals that the proposed workflow can be applied over a wide range of subsurface resources and can improve well productivity, maximize resource recovery, and project economics. The proposed workflow also provides a more interpretable model with diagnostics to evaluate the quality of the resulting model. This study contributes to the development of new methods and workflows to integrate widely available historical production data into multi-step time series forecasting, which can be applied to subsurface resources beyond the ones studied here.

AB  - Accurate estimation of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) is crucial for improving the water use efficiency and designing and operating irrigation systems. To accurately calculate winter wheat ETc with limited meteorological data, the present study proposed two interpretable machine learning (ML) models (random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)) as well as non-interpretable ML models (support vector machine (SVM) and deep neural network (DNN)) based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm using observed winter wheat ETc data during the period from 2007 to 2013 at Luan Cheng Agro-ecosystem Experimental Station. Mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), coefficient of determination (R-2), and global performance indicator (GPI) were used to assess the performance of models. This demonstrated that the ML models based on the crop coefficient (Kc) and solar radiation (Rn) were accurate and offered a workaround for calculating winter wheat ETc in the absence of meteorological data. In four ML models, the ninth input combination, consisting of Kc, Rn, daily air maximum temperature (Tmax), daily air minimum temperature (Tmin), sunshine hours (n), and wind speed with a height of 2 m (U2), produced the best estimate of ETc. Among them, the PSO-based SVM (PSO-SVM) model obtained the best results for estimating ETc with MAE, RMSE, NSE, R2, and GPI values of 0.389 mm center dot d(-1), 0.562 mm center dot d(-1) 0.910, 0.911, and 0.975, respectively, showing the advantages of the non-interpretable ML model in ETc forecasting. Accurate descriptions of actual hydrological and climatic processes were given by local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME). The inflection points of daily climatic parameters (Tmin, Tmax, Rn, n) related to ETc were determined to be 3.80 degrees C, 5.50 degrees C, 1.62 MJ center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1), 1.37 h, respectively. This work has potential to overcome the difficulty of measuring winter wheat ETc properly due to the lack of meteorological data and accomplish appropriate water management to conserve water and increase water productivity.

AB  - Ensuring the trustworthiness of artificial intelligence (AI) systems is critical as they become increasingly integrated into domains like healthcare, finance, and public administration. This paper explores frameworks and metrics for evaluating AI trustworthiness, focusing on key principles such as fairness, transparency, privacy, and security. This study is guided by two central questions: how can trust in AI systems be systematically measured across the AI lifecycle, and what are the trade-offs involved when optimizing for different trustworthiness dimensions? By examining frameworks such as the NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF), the AI Trust Framework and Maturity Model (AI-TMM), and ISO/IEC standards, this study bridges theoretical insights with practical applications. We identify major risks across the AI lifecycle stages and outline various metrics to address challenges in system reliability, bias mitigation, and model explainability. This study includes a comparative analysis of existing standards and their application across industries to illustrate their effectiveness. Real-world case studies, including applications in healthcare, financial services, and autonomous systems, demonstrate approaches to applying trust metrics. The findings reveal that achieving trustworthiness involves navigating trade-offs between competing metrics, such as fairness versus efficiency or privacy versus transparency, and emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration for robust AI governance. Emerging trends suggest the need for adaptive frameworks for AI trustworthiness that evolve alongside advancements in AI technologies. This paper contributes to the field by proposing a comprehensive review of existing frameworks with guidelines for building resilient, ethical, and transparent AI systems, ensuring their alignment with regulatory requirements and societal expectations.

AB  - Explanations of deep learning fault diagnosis models have been crucial for risk management and subsequent maintenance actions. Furthermore, purely data-driven approaches for fault diagnosis in industrial processes, without integrating process knowledge or guidance, are limited in generalization ability. This article proposes a graph-based self-explanatory fault diagnosis model. The model employs a graph attention mechanism on a constructed graph data representation of the industrial process, facilitating to capture the causal relationships between process variables. Once the model is fully trained, variations in attention coefficients from normal operating condition are used to identify the root cause of the faulty scenario. This self-explanatory methodology elucidates the model's actual reasoning, obviating the need for additional separate explainable AI methods. Validations through benchmark processes demonstrate significant improvement in fault classification accuracy. Furthermore, variations in attention coefficients effectively identified precise origins of various fault types, including faults that had not been encountered during model training phase.

AB  - We developed a combined drought index to better monitor agricultural drought events. To develop the index, different combinations of the temperature condition index, precipitation condition index, vegetation condition index, soil moisture condition index, gross primary productivity, and normalized difference water index were used to obtain a single drought severity index. To obtain more effective results, a mesoscale hydrologic model was used to obtain soil moisture values. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm was used to calculate the weights for the combined index. To provide input to the SHAP model, crop yield was predicted using a machine learning model, with the training set yielding a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.8, while the test set values were calculated to be 0.68. The representativeness of the new index in drought situations was compared with established indices, including the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and the Self-Calibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index (scPDSI). The index showed the highest correlation with an R-value of 0.82, followed by the SPEI with 0.7 and scPDSI with 0.48. This study contributes a different perspective for effective detection of agricultural drought events. The integration of an increased volume of data from remote sensing systems with technological advances could facilitate the development of significantly more efficient agricultural drought monitoring systems.

AB  - The radiogenomics analysis can provide the connections between genomics and radiomics, which can infer the genomic features of tumors from their radiogenomic associations through the low-cost and non-invasiveness screening ultrasonic images. Although there are a number of pioneer approaches exploring the connections between genomic aberrations and ultrasonic features, these studies mainly focus on the relationship between ultrasonic features and only the most popular cancer genes, confronting two difficulties: missing many-to -many relationships as omics-to-omics view, and confounding group-specific associations with whole sample associations. To overcome the difficulty of omics-to-omics view and the issue of tumor heterogeneity, we propose an omics-to-omics joint knowledge association subtensor model. Specifically, the subtensor factorization framework can successfully discover the joint cross-modal module via an omics-to-omics view, while the sparse weight sample indication strategy can mine sample subgroups from the multi-omic data with tumor heterogeneity. The experimental evaluation result shows the jointness of the discovered modules across omics, their association with tumorigenesis contribution, and their relation for cancer related functions. In summary, our proposed omics-to-omics joint knowledge association subtensor model can serve as an efficient tool for radiogenomic knowledge associations, promoting the cross-modal knowledge graph construction of in explainable artificial intelligence cancer diagnosis.

AB  - Leptospirosis is a widespread zoonotic disease with complex spatio-temporal dynamics. This study investigates the use of Deep Neural Network (DNN) in combination with Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) for weekly spatio-temporal predictions of leptospirosis occurrence. The predictive model integrates hydroclimatic and environmental data to assess its effectiveness in predicting leptospirosis cases and quantifying key input variables in Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia. Using a DNN architecture with hyperparameter tuning via grid search, we developed a globally trained model that achieved an overall prediction accuracy of 70.5% across 214 pixels. We identified acidic soil and a higher presence of rubber plantations as strong predictors of leptospirosis occurrence. Additionally, mean temperature and minimum rainfall emerged as important hydroclimatic contributors. These insights enable public health authorities to proactively identify and prioritize high-risk areas for targeted interventions, improving disease mitigation strategies. Furthermore, the methodology is adaptable to other regions with similar environmental and socio-economic conditions, strengthening early warning systems and enhancing preparedness against future leptospirosis outbreaks. While demonstrated on leptospirosis prediction, the proposed DNN-LIME framework is adaptable to spatiotemporal challenges in diverse domains such as supply chain optimization, urban planning, and industrial risk management. The integration of interpretability via LIME ensures actionable insights for stakeholders beyond public health, bridging the gap between complex models and real-world decision-making.

AB  - Association Rule Mining is a machine learning method for discovering the interesting relations between the attributes in a huge transaction database. Typically, algorithms for Association Rule Mining generate a huge number of association rules, from which it is hard to extract structured knowledge and present this automatically in a form that would be suitable for the user. Recently, an information cartography has been proposed for creating structured summaries of information and visualizing with methodology called "metro maps". This was applied to several problem domains, where pattern mining was necessary. The aim of this study is to develop a method for automatic creation of metro maps of information obtained by Association Rule Mining and, thus, spread its applicability to the other machine learning methods. Although the proposed method consists of multiple steps, its core presents metro map construction that is defined in the study as an optimization problem, which is solved using an evolutionary algorithm. Finally, this was applied to four well-known UCI Machine Learning datasets and one sport dataset. Visualizing the resulted metro maps not only justifies that this is a suitable tool for presenting structured knowledge hidden in data, but also that they can tell stories to users.

AB  - Landslide susceptibility assessment (LSA) is crucial for effective regional geohazard risk management and territorial spatial planning. Recent advancements in machine learning (ML) have enhanced the accuracy of landslide susceptibility modeling. However, ML models face challenges in efficiently identifying potential landslide-prone areas because of the considerable time and resources required for data processing, model selection, and tuning, even for experienced specialists. This study proposes a hybrid approach that combines an automated ML model (AutoML) with the Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to automatically predict landslides and provide a comprehensive explanation of the predictions. The AutoML model was employed for the southern foothills of Changbai Mountain, utilizing a dataset of 381 landslides with 16 landslide conditioning factors. The model automatically completed the assessment task, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.9. Compared to traditional models, such as logistic regression, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and two-dimensional convolutional neural network models, the AutoML model demonstrated high efficiency and good accuracy. Furthermore, the SHAP method offered a nuanced understanding of the interplay between model outcomes and conditioning factors from global and local perspectives. The SHAP method identified roads, altitudes, and slopes as key drivers of landslides in the case areas, revealing a non-linear relationship between feature variables and landslide prediction. These findings suggest that hybrid AutoML-SHAP can provide a new method for automatically assessing landslide susceptibility and introduce explainable artificial intelligence models.

AB  - In contrast to the threats to urban human health, impacts of air pollutants on the ecosystem photosynthesis seem to be less concerned. The existence of aerosols could promote photosynthesis by increasing the ratio of diffuse to direct solar radiation; on the contrary, ozone (O-3) could inhibit photosynthesis, as it is detrimental to leaf stomata. However, it is unknown whether these two opposite impacts worldwide cancel each other out. In the current mainstream methods, earth system models may show conflicts with in situ experimental results due to their relatively coarse resolution. In virtue of satellite remote sensing and a global eddy covariance (EC) network, we studied ten years of data to explore the impacts of aerosol and O-3 on photosynthesis by fitting an explainable machine learning model. The impacts of aerosol on gross primary productivity (GPP) were positive in many cases, yet very weak. By means of the nitrogen dioxide (NO2) to formaldehyde (HCHO) ratio, O-3 was seen with positive impacts on photosynthesis under the NOx-sensitive regime, but the apparent positive impacts correlated with the plant phenology. Under the volatile organic compound (VOC)-sensitive regime, the impacts of O-3 on GPP were not obvious, which was likely due to the prioritized depletion of O-3 by NO2 and VOCs. The impacts of air pollutants depended on many factors and results varied case by case, but the overall net impacts were negative.

AB  - Agriculture is a crucial sector in many countries, particularly in India, where it significantly influences the economy, food supply, and rural livelihoods. The increased integration of Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) into agriculture has enabled substantial advancements in predicting crop yields and analyzing factors affecting them. The counterfactual reasoning framework of DICE outperforms LIME and DICE in offering finer insights into feature importance and the relative impact of different factors on yield prediction. DICE provided the clearest causal insights, demonstrating how adjustments to attributes like sandy alfisols and surface texture could lead to significant changes in crop yield by affecting water retention and nutrient availability. SHAP ranked features like phosphate and potash based on their average importance across the dataset, offering a global view of influential factors but lacking in-depth causal understanding. LIME provided localized insights on immediate influences, such as average rainfall and nitrogen content, although it fell short in revealing broader causal interactions essential for targeted agricultural interventions. The findings highlight the significance of counterfactual explanations in agricultural ML models, as they provide a robust understanding of causal relationships, going beyond correlation-based attributions. The study provides understandable and practical insights, allowing for focused actions to enhance productivity and adaptability in agriculture. By improving the interpretability of agricultural machine learning models, the research ultimately supports the creation of predictive systems that strengthen sustainable practices and economic development within the agricultural industry.

AB  - Examining the relationship between streetscape features and road traffic accidents is pivotal for enhancing roadway safety. While previous studies have primarily focused on the influence of street design characteristics, sociodemographic features, and land use features on crash occurrence, the impact of streetscape features on pedestrian crashes has not been thoroughly investigated. Furthermore, while machine learning models demonstrate high accuracy in prediction and are increasingly utilized in traffic safety research, understanding the prediction results poses challenges. To address these gaps, this study extracts streetscape environment characteristics from street view images (SVIs) using a combination of semantic segmentation and object detection deep learning networks. These characteristics are then incorporated into the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, along with a set of control variables, to model the occurrence of pedestrian crashes at intersections. Subsequently, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method is integrated with XGBoost to establish an interpretable framework for exploring the association between pedestrian crash occurrence and the surrounding streetscape built environment. The results are interpreted from global, local, and regional perspectives. The findings indicate that, from a global perspective, traffic volume and commercial land use are significant contributors to pedestrian-vehicle collisions at intersections, while road, person, and vehicle elements extracted from SVIs are associated with higher risks of pedestrian crash onset. At a local level, the XGBoost-SHAP framework enables quantification of features' local contributions for individual intersections, revealing spatial heterogeneity in factors influencing pedestrian crashes. From a regional perspective, similar intersections can be grouped to define geographical regions, facilitating the formulation of spatially responsive strategies for distinct regions to reduce traffic accidents. This approach can potentially enhance the quality and accuracy of local policy making. These findings underscore the underlying relationship between streetscape-level environmental characteristics and vehicle-pedestrian crashes. The integration of SVIs and deep learning techniques offers a visually descriptive portrayal of the streetscape environment at locations where traffic crashes occur at eye level. The proposed framework not only achieves excellent prediction performance but also enhances understanding of traffic crash occurrences, offering guidance for optimizing traffic accident prevention and treatment programs.

AB  - Fault diagnosis of the fan in steelmaking shops has significant practical value in guaranteeing smooth operation and achieving quality control of steel coils. The existing data-driven systems, mainly deep neural network-based diagnostic models, have achieved some success in recognizing fan faults. However, these models face a significant challenge in reaching reliable diagnostic conclusions with uncertainty due to the absence of interpretable representations between fault labels and features. To address this issue, this paper develops and evaluates an interpretable model, namely Stacked Logic Denoising Auto-Encoders (SLDAE). SLDAE is a flexible neural-symbolic system that extracts confidence rules and Binary Decision Logic (BDL) rules to explain how SDAE conducts feature learning, and conducts uncertain reasoning of diagnostic decision-making. To extract confidence rules, a logic grouping DAE is designed to consider the impact of different literals on neuron activation so as to reduce information loss. To extract BDL rules, we design a novel network structure, Discrete Logic Networks (DLNs), to facilitate extracting implicit relationships between fault features and labels while learning and representing the belief of BDL rules. Experiments verified on two fan datasets indicate that SLDAE can perform quantitative reasoning of uncertain diagnostic logic and exhibits a notable performance in fault recognition.

AB  - Next-generation sequencing has been essential to the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of January 2022, nearly 7 million severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) sequences are available to researchers in public databases. Sequence databases are an abundant resource from which to extract biologically relevant and clinically actionable information. As the pandemic has gone on, SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly evolved, involving complex genomic changes that challenge current approaches to classifying SARS-CoV-2 variants. Deep sequence learning could be a potentially powerful way to build complex sequence-to-phenotype models. Unfortunately, while they can be predictive, deep learning typically produces "black box" models that cannot directly provide biological and clinical insight. Researchers should therefore consider implementing emerging methods for visualizing and interpreting deep sequence models. Finally, researchers should address important data limitations, including (i) global sequencing disparities, (ii) insufficient sequence metadata, and (iii) screening artifacts due to poor sequence quality control.

AB  - Reliable predictions of concrete strength can reduce construction time and labor costs, providing strong support for building construction quality inspection. To enhance the accuracy of concrete strength prediction, this paper introduces an interpretable framework for machine learning (ML) models to predict the compressive strength of high-performance concrete (HPC). By leveraging information from a concrete dataset, an additional six features were added as inputs in the training process of the random forest (RF), AdaBoost, XGBoost and LightGBM models, and the optimal hyperparameters of the models were determined using 5-fold cross-validation and random search methods. Four interpretable ML models for predicting the compressive strength of HPC, including the RF, AdaBoost, XGBoost and LightGBM models, which combine feature derivation and random search, were constructed. In addition, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was applied to analyze the effects of the input features on the prediction results of the LightGBM model, which combines feature derivation and random search. The results showed that input features such as age, water/cement ratio, slag, and water were the key influences for predicting the compressive strength of HPC. Input features such as the superplastic/cement ratio, slag/cement ratio, and ash/cement ratio had nonsignificant impacts on the predicted compressive strength.

AB  - The precise prediction of tunnel convergence holds significant importance in ensuring the safety and efficiency of tunnel construction. This study involves the construction of seven machine learning (ML) models that are deemed reliable for predicting crown convergence (CC) of plateau mountain tunnels. These models include Knearest neighbour (KNN), support vector regression (SVR), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), categorical boosting (CatBoost), and automated machine learning model (Auto- ML). The Bayesian optimization (BO) technique and the Tree-based pipeline optimization tool (TPOT) were employed to optimize the hyperparameters of non-automated machine learning models and the automated machine learning model, separately. A total of 2,734 samples of crown convergence monitoring data were collected for training and testing the models. The evaluation metrics employed to assess the performance of the models' predictions included the determination coefficient (R2), 2 ), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE). The XGBoost model demonstrated the best prediction performance with the R2, 2 , MAPE, MAE, and RMSE of 0.9887, 0.1271, 0.7759, and 1.1845 on test set. The XGBoost, CatBoost, and Auto-ML models were utilized to predict the crown convergence monitoring curves of four sections of Huzhubeishan Tunnel in Qinghai Province, China. Notably, the predicted curves exhibited a significant level of concordance with the actual monitoring curves. The results of Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) suggested that time, tunnel depth ratio and groundwater table were more important than other input variables. The XGBoost model showed the best robustness of prediction performance across varying dataset sizes for seven distinct machine learning models.

AB  - Background: Persistent sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) shows poor clinical outcomes and remains a therapeutic challenge for clinicians. Early identification and prediction of persistent SA-AKI are crucial. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and validate an interpretable machine learning (ML) model that predicts persistent SA-AKI and to compare its diagnostic performance with that of C-C motif chemokine ligand 14 (CCL14) in a prospective cohort. Methods: The study used 4 retrospective cohorts and 1 prospective cohort for model derivation and validation. The derivation cohort used the MIMIC-IV database, which was randomly split into 2 parts (80% for model construction and 20% for internal validation). External validation was conducted using subsets of the MIMIC-III dataset and e-ICU dataset, and retrospectivecohorts from the intensive care unit (ICU) of Northern Jiangsu People's Hospital. Prospective data from the same ICU were used for validation and comparison with urinary CCL14 biomarker measurements. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was defined based on serum creatinineandurineoutput, usingtheKidneyDisease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. Routineclinical data within the first 24 hours of ICU admission were collected, and 8 ML algorithms were used to construct the prediction model. Multiple evaluation metrics, including area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), were used to compare predictive performance. Feature importance was ranked using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), and the final model was explained accordingly. In addition, the model was developed into a web-based application using the Streamlit framework to facilitate its clinical application. Results: A total of 46,097 patients with sepsis from multiple cohorts were enrolled for analysis. Among 17,928 patients with sepsis in the derivation cohort, 8081 patients (45.1%) showed progression to persistent SA-AKI. Among the 8 ML models, the gradient boosting machine (GBM) model demonstrated superior discriminative ability. Following feature importance ranking, a final interpretable GBM model comprising 12 features (AKI stage, Delta Creatinine, urine output, furosemide dose, BMI, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, kidney replacement therapy, mechanical ventilation, lactate, blood urea nitrogen, prothrombin time, and age) was established. The final model accurately predicted the occurrence of persistent SA-AKI in both internal (AUC=0.870) and external validation cohorts (MIMIC-III subset: AUC=0.891; e-ICU dataset: AUC=0.932; Northern Jiangsu People's Hospital retrospective cohort: AUC=0.983). In the prospective cohort, the GBM model outperformed urinary CCL14 in predicting persistent SA-AKI (GBM AUC=0.852 vs CCL14 AUC=0.821). The model has been transformed into an online clinical tool to facilitate its application in clinical settings. Conclusions: The interpretable GBM model was shown to successfully and accurately predict the occurrence of persistent SA-AKI, demonstrating good predictive ability in both internal and external validation cohorts. Furthermore, the model was demonstrated to outperform the biomarker CCL14 in prospective cohort validation.

AB  - The steelmaking industry is one of the most energy-intensive industries and is responsible for 4% of the world's total greenhouse gas emissions. Solutions to improve operational efficiency can therefore bring major improvements to the overall environmental performance of the entire industry. This article proposes a novel steel quality prediction system based on gradient boosting trees that can be used to predict the quality of steel products during manufacturing. The prediction system enables the detection of possible surface defects in the early phase of the manufacturing process, thus avoiding costly and time-consuming manufacturing efforts to address defective products. In this study, we trained a prediction model with data collected from an SSAB Europe steelmaking plant in Raahe, Finland. From the 296 process parameters measured in the liquid steel stage of steelmaking, we selected 89 input features to train and test the prediction model. The model was then integrated into a quality monitoring tool (QMT) to utilize real-time manufacturing data in its predictions. The validation process showed that the prediction model can find more than 50% of defective steel products by marking only about 10% of the steel products as potentially at risk of surface defects in plate rolling. This can potentially save time in the quality control phase and improve process efficiency. To gain more insights into the model predictions, we used SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to find a potential connection between the process input parameters and surface defects.

AB  - The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into manufacturing is transforming the industry by advancing predictive maintenance, quality control, and supply chain optimisation, while also driving the shift from Industry 4.0 towards a more human-centric and sustainable vision. This emerging paradigm, known as Industry 5.0, emphasises resilience, ethical innovation, and the symbiosis between humans and intelligent systems, with AI playing a central enabling role. However, challenges such as the "black box" nature of AI models, data biases, ethical concerns, and the lack of robust frameworks for trustworthiness hinder its widespread adoption. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of AI trustworthiness in the manufacturing industry, examining the evolution of industrial paradigms, identifying key barriers to AI adoption, and examining principles such as transparency, fairness, robustness, and accountability. It offers a detailed summary of existing toolkits and methodologies for explainability, bias mitigation, and robustness, which are essential for fostering trust in AI systems. Additionally, this paper examines challenges throughout the AI pipeline, from data collection to model deployment, and concludes with recommendations and research questions aimed at addressing these issues. By offering actionable insights, this study aims to guide researchers, practitioners, and policymakers in developing ethical and reliable AI systems that align with the principles of Industry 5.0, ensuring both technological advancement and societal value.

AB  - Background: Coffee is an important commodity in the worldwide economy and smart technologies are important for accurate quality control and consumer-oriented product development. Sensory perception is probably the most important information since it is directly related to product acceptance. However, sensory analysis is imprecise and present large deviation related to subjectivity and relying exclusively on the sensory panel. Thus, practical technologies may be developed to assist in making accurate decisions. Results: This study presents a new method applying laser-assisted rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometry (LA-REIMS) coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry to fingerprint coffee samples. Predictive models have estimated sensory properties with accuracies between 87 and 96 % for test samples. The complex relationship between the MS profiles and modelled properties, artificial neural networks (ANN) outperformed partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) on estimation of coffee properties. Tentatively identified compounds such as sugars, chlorogenic, and fatty acids were the ones that most affected coffee sensory properties according to a novel approach to evaluate ANN weights. Significance: The proposed method could analyse coffee samples with minimal sample preparation using an automated device.

AB  - Automated defect detection in manufacturing is a critical component of modern quality control, ensuring high production efficiency and minimizing defective outputs. This study presents an enhanced VGG16-based convolutional neural network (CNN) model for defect classification and localization, improving upon traditional vision-based inspection methods. The proposed model integrates advanced deep learning techniques, including batch normalization and dropout regularization, to enhance generalization and prevent overfitting. Extensive experiments were conducted on benchmark manufacturing defect datasets, evaluating performance based on accuracy, loss evolution, precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP). The results demonstrate that the enhanced VGG16 model outperforms conventional CNN architectures and the standard VGG16, achieving higher defect classification accuracy and superior feature extraction capabilities. The model successfully detects multiple defect types, including surface irregularities, scratches, and deformations, with improved robustness in complex industrial environments. Additionally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis confirms the model's high sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing between defective and non-defective components. Despite its strong performance, challenges such as dataset scarcity, computational costs, and model interpretability remain areas for further research. Future directions include the integration of lightweight architectures for real-time deployment, generative adversarial networks (GANs) for data augmentation, and explainable AI techniques for improved transparency. The findings of this study highlight the transformative potential of deep learning in manufacturing defect detection, paving the way for intelligent, automated quality control systems that enhance production efficiency and reliability. The proposed approach contributes to the advancement of Industry 4.0 by enabling scalable, data-driven decision-making in manufacturing processes.

AB  - Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for handling graph-structured data. However, their design often limits them to learning only higher-order feature interactions, leaving low-order feature interactions overlooked. To address this problem, we introduce a novel GNN method called explicit feature interaction-aware graph neural network (EFI-GNN). Unlike conventional GNNs, EFI-GNN is a multilayer linear network designed to model arbitrary-order feature interactions explicitly within graphs. To validate the efficacy of EFI-GNN, we conduct experiments using various datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that EFI-GNN has competitive performance with existing GNNs, and when a GNN is jointly trained with EFI-GNN, predictive performance sees an improvement. Furthermore, the predictions made by EFI-GNN are interpretable, owing to its linear construction. The source code of EFI-GNN is available at https://github.com/gim4855744/EFI-GNN.

AB  - Cement-based foam has emerged as a strong contender in sustainable construction owing to its superior thermal and sound insulation properties, fire resistance, and cost-effectiveness. To effectively use cement-based foam as a thermal insulation material, it is important to accurately predict its thermal conductivity. The current study aims at coining an accurate methodology for predicting the thermal conductivity of cement-based foam using state-ofthe-art machine learning techniques. A comprehensive experimental dataset of 504 data points was developed and used for training ensemble learning models including XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM and Random Forest. The independent variables of this dataset affecting the thermal conductivity are the cast density, percentage of pozzolan, porosity, percentage of moisture, and duration of hydration in days. Using the Isolation Forest algorithm proved effective in detecting and eliminating outliers in the dataset. All the ensemble learning techniques explored in this study achieved superior predictive accuracy with a coefficient of determination greater than 0.98 on the test dataset. The influence of the input features on the thermal conductivity was visualized using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) approach and individual conditional expectation (ICE) plots. The cast density had the greatest effect on thermal conductivity. The explainable machine learning models demonstrated superior accuracy, efficiency, and reliability in estimating the thermal insulation of cement-based foam, opening the door for wider acceptance of this material in sustainable energy efficient construction.

AB  - This article proposes a human posture classification system to classify the four postures of standing, bending, sitting, and lying using three-dimensional (3-D) fuzzy body voxel features obtained from two cameras and hierarchical fuzzy classifiers (FCs). The system consists of four parts: human body segmentation, 3-D body voxel model construction, feature extraction, and classification. A region-dependent Gaussian mixture model with shadow removal is proposed for human body segmentation. The silhouette volume intersection method with computation speedup is then used to construct the 3-D body model using the segmented images from two cameras. After that, fuzzy 3-D body voxel features for posture classification are extracted from a minimum enclosed cube of the 3-D model. For classification, this article proposes an FC with soft margin minimization (FC-SMM) and its hierarchical structure to improve the classification performance. The consequent and antecedent parameters are optimized through a linear batch support vector machine and margin selective gradient descent algorithm, respectively. The FC-SMM also shows the advantage of model interpretability through visualization of the fuzzy rules. Experimental results of the comparison of different feature extraction methods and classifiers in different videos show the superiority of the proposed classification method.

AB  - Prediction of mode choice for travelers has been the subject of keen interest among transportation planners. Traditionally, mode choice analysis is conducted by statistical models or simple machine learning (ML) paradigms. Although statistical analysis approaches have a good theoretical basis and interpretability, they are built on several unrealistic assumptions regarding the distribution of data, which may lead to biased model predictions. On the other hand, the ML methods widely used in this regard have poor interpretability and fail to capture the behavioral aspects. To fill this gap, this study proposes a systematic machine learning (ML) framework for a better understanding of traveler's mode choice decisions. Five different ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forests, Decision Tree, Multilayer Perceptron, Light Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (LightGBDT)) were developed to model the travel mode choices of travelers using three years of Dutch National Travel Survey data. Empirical results of various performance evaluation metrics (overall accuracy, average precision, precision-recall curves) showed that LightGBDT outperformed other models for both under and oversampling strategies. To overcome the blackbox criticism of ML models and to improve their interpretability, variable importance and SHAP dependency analysis were also conducted. The analysis showed that predictors that significantly influence the travel mode decisions of travelers include trip distance, travelers' age and annual income, number of cars/bicycles owned, and trip density. The results can be used for better understanding and effective modeling of travelers' mode choice preferences.

AB  - The production of cement is crucial for sustainable building construction but is costly and contributes significantly to environmental pollution. To address these issues, this research investigates the potential of partially replacing cement with waste banana leaf ash (BLA), a pozzolanic material, in concrete mixtures. The aim of this study is to evaluate the fresh, mechanical, durability, and microstructural properties of BLA-incorporated concrete, alongside its environmental and economic impacts. Experimental methods assessed the workability (slump and compaction factor), mechanical properties (compressive, split-tensile strength, and modulus of elasticity), and durability aspects through Rapid Chloride Penetration Test (RCPT), Water Permeability Test (WPT), sorptivity, and electrical resistivity tests. Results indicate that as BLA content increases, workability declines. Mechanically, BLA concrete generally shows reduced performance; however, the 10% BLA mix improves strength compared to other BLA percentages. Durability tests reveal significant improvements from 28 to 91 days for the 10% BLA mix, with RCPT, WPT, sorptivity, and resistivity increasing by 22.44%, 19.55%, 49.02%, and 18.72%, respectively. Microstructural analysis via Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) indicates a decrease in ettringite formation with BLA. Additionally, machine learning models were applied to predict compressive strength, identifying influential factors using SHapley additive explanations (SHAP) and Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) analyses. The 10% BLA concrete mix achieved a 14.78% reduction in Global Warming Potential (GWP) compared to conventional concrete, with a GWP of 426.29 kgCO2-eq/kg, and proved cost-effective. These findings suggest that a 10% cement replacement with BLA presents an optimal balance of environmental sustainability, costeffectiveness, and strength for construction housing sector.

AB  - Understanding the relationship between the audiovisual environment of streets and cycling behavior is crucial for designing more inclusive and responsive transport environments. However, most previous studies have concentrated on the macro-level aspects of the built environment, such as land-use mix, while overlooking the street-space quality characteristics that influence cyclists' on-site perceptions. Although research has explored the role of objective visual features, studies on the audiovisual environment of streets and its perceived impact remain scarce. This study combines street view imagery, Strava Heatmap data, and interpretable machine learning to investigate the nonlinear and interactive effects of street-level spatial quality on cycling volumes. The results indicate that (1) auditory characteristics-especially noise intensity and sound quality-exert a significant and often stronger influence on cycling volume than visual features alone, challenging visual-centric planning assumptions; (2) several spatial features show nonlinear or threshold effects (e.g., green view index and soundscape eventfulness exhibit inverted U-shaped curves), indicating that excessive environmental richness may reduce cycling appeal (3) synergistic and antagonistic interactions exist between visual and auditory elements-for instance, natural sounds can mitigate the negative impact of high noise, while enclosed visual environments amplify it. These findings provide empirical evidence that optimizing-rather than maximizing-street-level sensory stimuli is essential for promoting active travel. Building on this insight, our study offers practical guidance for policymakers and urban designers to implement more targeted and context-sensitive interventions, and underscores the potential of integrating audiovisual design into sustainable transport planning.

KW  - INDEX
AB  - Sepsis-Associated Liver Injury (SALI) is an independent risk factor for death from sepsis. The aim of this study was to develop an interpretable machine learning model for early prediction of 28-day mortality in patients with SALI. Data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV, v2.2, MIMIC-III, v1.4) were used in this study. The study cohort from MIMIC-IV was randomized to the training set (0.7) and the internal validation set (0.3), with MIMIC-III (2001 to 2008) as external validation. The features with more than 20% missing values were deleted and the remaining features were multiple interpolated. Lasso-CV that lasso linear model with iterative fitting along a regularization path in which the best model is selected by cross-validation was used to select important features for model development. Eight machine learning models including Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost), K Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, Generalized Linear Models in which the best model is selected by cross-validation (CV_glmnet), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) were developed. Shapley additive interpretation (SHAP) was used to improve the interpretability of the optimal model. At last, a total of 1043 patients were included, of whom 710 were from MIMIC-IV and 333 from MIMIC-III. Twenty-four clinically relevant parameters were selected for model construction. For the prediction of 28-day mortality of SALI in the internal validation set, the area under the curve (AUC (95% CI)) of RF was 0.79 (95% CI: 0.73-0.86), and which performed the best. Compared with the traditional disease severity scores including Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score (OASIS), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), Logistic Organ Dysfunction Score (LODS), Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), and Acute Physiology Score III (APS III), RF also had the best performance. SHAP analysis found that Urine output, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), minimal Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS_min), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and admission_age were the five most important features affecting RF model. Therefore, RF has good predictive ability for 28-day mortality prediction in SALI. Urine output, CCI, GCS_min, BUN and age at admission(admission_age) within 24 h after intensive care unit(ICU) admission contribute significantly to model prediction.

Herein, an interpretable deep learning embedded hyperspectral imaging methodology was established to control the quality of Ginkgo Folium. Hyperspectral images were collected from 102 batches of Ginkgo Folium ranging from 389.8 nm to 1048.2 nm. The contents of three flavonol glycosides and four terpene lactones in Ginkgo Folium were unambiguously determined by well-validated high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-TQ-MS) methods, whilst the moisture content measured through a moisture meter. In order to realize the real-time full quality inspection, competitive adapative reweighted sampling-partial least squares regression (CARS-PLSR) and seven deep learning algorithms (ResNet50, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, DenseNet121, ResNeXt50, Inception-V4 and InceptionResNet-V2) were attempted to establish a robust quantitative calibration model embedded hyperspectral imager. As a result, DenseNet121 algorithm showed the most excellent predictive performance. The R2p values of quercetin, kaempferol, isorhamnetin, bilobalide, ginkgolide A, ginkgolide B, ginkgolide C, and moisture were determined to be 0.9969, 0.9913, 0.9965, 0.9988, 0.9951, 0.9952, 0.9988 and 0.9981, respectively, and the RMSEP values were 0.0084, 0.0094, 0.0103, 0.0053, 0.0056, 0.0099, 0.0084 and 0.0050, respectively. GradCAM was used to unlock the blackbox of DenseNet121model and interpret the model. It's believed that the established DenseNet121 embedded hyperspectral imager can rapidly and nondestructive determine the eight quality attributes and provide a tool for full quality inspection on Ginkgo Folium.

AB  - Predicting the Curie temperature (Tc) is a crucial problem in the field of amorphous alloys. In this study, Fe-based amorphous alloys are taken as an example, and the composition and corresponding Tc are collected through a literature review. Three feature construction strategies are employed to establish the relationship between the composition and Tc using machine learning. The research findings demonstrate that the combination of the Meredig rule and the GBT algorithm yields the highest prediction accuracy. The features are constructed using recursive elimination and enumeration methods, ultimately resulting in an optimal 8-dimensional feature subset. Furthermore, the Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values are introduced to analyze the interpretability of the prediction model, providing a feature importance ranking and their critical values. Finally, by replacing the Fe and P atoms with Mn and Si atoms, respectively, in the Fe80P13C7 alloy, Fe62Mn18P(13-x)C7Six (x = 4,5,6) alloys are successfully designed to exhibit a Tc close to room temperature (335 K), enabling customized Tc design for Fe-based amorphous alloys.

AB  - Ammonia (NH3) is a gaseous pollutant with significant environmental and health implications. Over recent decades, its increasing concentrations, driven by industrialization and agriculture, have necessitated highresolution monitoring. However, limited daily ground-based observations hinder comprehensive analysis. This study developed machine learning-based frameworks-deep neural network (DNN), random forest, and light gradient boosting machine-to predict biweekly NH3 concentrations and downscale them to daily estimates across the United States during 2017-2022. The models integrate NH3 column concentrations, meteorological variables, land cover data, livestock information, and ground-based measurements. Among the models, DNN showed superior performance in both spatial cross-validation and independent testing, achieving a correlation coefficient of 0.79, a root mean square error of 0.98 mu g/m3 , and an index of agreement of 0.83- effectively capturing fine-scale spatial variations at a 9 km resolution. Shapley additive explanations analysis identified temporal dynamic factors-such as day of year and meteorological variables-as key predictors, along with land cover and cattle density, highlighting the model's ability to support the temporal downscaling of NH3 from biweekly to daily scale. When applied to the UK, the model demonstrated its potential for spatial transferability via the leave-one station-out and leave-one year-out cross validations. These findings highlight the ability of machine learning in bridging temporal gaps and generating high-resolution daily NH3 estimates.

AB  - Current national occupational safety and health (OSH) initiatives follow reactive approaches, i.e., if it breaks, fix it. Existing accounts, however, failed to improve national OSH performances substantially, which imposes the need for an in-depth and proactive (fix it so it will not break) investigation of national occupational fatality risks. Despite many studies examining the fatality risk of workers based on project-, company-, and/or behavior-related factors, the role of national conditions on the countrywide fatality risk of workers has not been explored. The present research leverages the national statistics of Turkey to examine their influence on construction workers' fatality risk through a machine learning-based prediction model. Several widely used machine learning methods were adopted for determining whether the upcoming month poses a significant fatality risk for construction workers or not based on national statistics of the previous month. According to analysis results, the gradient boosting decision tree algorithm yielded the highest prediction performance in terms of f1-score. The recently developed game theory-based Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) algorithm was used to identify whether and how national conditions affect countrywide fatality risk of construction workers. Findings illustrate that the share of the construction sector in employment, market demand, and labor shortage are the most significant national factors in determining the fatality risk. SHAP summary and SHAP dependence plots are further presented to provide decision makers with a clearer understanding of hidden relationships between fatality risk and national conditions. In addition, a framework that can be practically used by policy makers and governmental authorities is developed to help minimize national occupational fatality risk. Overall, predicting national fatality risk in the industry and identifying the national precursors of occupational fatalities contribute to the development of macrolevel safety improvements based on country-specific conditions.

KW  - INJURIES
AB  - Identifying syndesmotic instability in ankle fractures using conventional radiographs is still a major challenge. In this study we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the fracture utilizing the AO-classification (AO-44 A/B/C) and to simultaneously detect syndesmosis instability in the conventional radiograph by leveraging the intraoperative stress testing as the gold standard. In this retrospective exploratory study we identified 700 patients with rotational ankle fractures at a university hospital from 2019 to 2024, from whom 1588 digital radiographs were extracted to train, validate, and test a CNN. Radiographs were classified based on the therapy-decisive gold standard of the intraoperative hook-test and the preoperatively determined AO-classification from the surgical report. To perform internal validation and quality control, the algorithm results were visualized using Guided Score Class activation maps (GSCAM).The AO44-classification sensitivity over all subclasses was 91%. Furthermore, the syndesmosis instability could be identified with a sensitivity of 0.84 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78, 0.92) and specificity 0.8 (95% CI 0.67, 0.9). Consistent visualization results were obtained from the GSCAMs. The integration of an explainable deep-learning algorithm, trained on an intraoperative gold standard showed a 0.84 sensitivity for syndesmotic stability testing. Thus, providing clinically interpretable outputs, suggesting potential for enhanced preoperative decision-making in complex ankle trauma.

AB  - As reconstruction and redevelopment accelerate, the generation of construction waste increases, and construction waste treatment technology is being developed accordingly, especially using artificial intelligence (AI). The majority of AI research projects fail as a consequence of poor learning data as opposed to the structure of the AI model. If data pre-processing and labeling, i.e., the processes prior to the training step, are not carried out with development purposes in mind, the desired AI model cannot be obtained. Therefore, in this study, the performance differences of the construction waste recognition model, after data pre-processing and labeling by individuals with different degrees of expertise, were analyzed with the goal of distinguishing construction waste accurately and increasing the recycling rate. According to the experimental results, it was shown that the mean average precision (mAP) of the AI model that trained on the dataset labeled by non-professionals was superior to that labeled by professionals, being 21.75 higher in the box and 26.47 in the mask, on average. This was because it was labeled using a similar method as the Microsoft Common Objects in Context (MS COCO) datasets used for You Only Look at Coefficients (YOLACT), despite them possessing different traits for construction waste. Construction waste is differentiated by texture and color; thus, we augmented the dataset by adding noise (texture) and changing the color to consider these traits. This resulted in a meaningful accuracy being achieved in 25 epochs-two fewer than the unreinforced dataset. In order to develop an AI model that recognizes construction waste, which is an atypical object, it is necessary to develop an explainable AI model, such as a reconstruction AI network, using the model's feature map or by creating a dataset with weights added to the texture and color of the construction waste.

AB  - Telematics devices have transformed driver risk assessment, allowing insurers to tailor premiums based on detailed evaluations of driving habits. However, integrating Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and contextualized geolocation data for predictive improvements remains underexplored due to the recent emergence of these technologies. This article introduces a novel risk assessment methodology that periodically computes weekly insurance premiums by incorporating ADAS risk indicators and contextualized geolocation data. Using a naturalistic dataset from a fleet of 354 commercial drivers over a year, we modeled the relationship between past claims and driving data, and use that to compute weekly premiums that penalize risky driving situations. Risk predictions are modeled through claims frequency using Poisson regression and claims occurrence probability using machine learning models, including XGBoost and TabNet, and interpreted with SHAP. The dataset is divided into weekly profiles containing aggregated driving behavior, ADAS events, and contextual attributes. Results indicate that both modeling approaches show consistent attribute impacts on driver risk. For claims occurrence probability, XGBoost achieved the lowest Log Loss, reducing it from 0.59 to 0.51 with the inclusion of all attributes; for claims frequency, no statistically significant differences were observed when including all attributes. However, adding ADAS and contextual attributes allows for a comprehensive and disaggregated interpretation of the resulting weekly premium. This dynamic pricing can be incorporated into the insurance lifecycle, enabling bespoke risk assessment based on emerging technologies, the driving context, and driver behavior.

AB  - The efficient prediction of airborne bacterial concentrations is crucial for better understanding and management of environmental sanitation risks in waste facilities. Traditional linear models have proven inadequate in capturing the complex relationships governing the formation of airborne microorganisms. This study developed four machine learning (ML) models to estimate airborne bacterial concentrations in waste facilities regarding the combined dataset as input features. The results revealed that integrating environmental factors, gaseous pollutants, and microbial datasets as input features yielded an improved testing R-2 of 0.7369, with a random forest (RF) model identified as the best-performing algorithm. The bacterial populations on the surfaces and handles of waste containers were identified as the most influential parameters in the RF model. The optimal ranges of temperature (32-36 degrees C) and relative humidity (62 %-80 %), the optimal concentrations of ammonia (< 0.15 mg/m(3)) and particulate matter 2.5 (0.01-0.07 mg/m(3)), and the effective disinfection measures of slightly acidic electrolyzed water were recommended for controlling airborne pollution in waste facilities. Overall, the research demonstrates that ML methods have the potential in the prediction of airborne bacterial concentrations in waste facilities. By identifying critical factors with the interpretability analysis, this study offers valuable insights for targeted airborne microorganisms' risk management strategies.

AB  - A virtual power plant (VPP) refers to an active aggregator of heterogeneous distributed energy resources (DERs), which creates a promising pathway to expand renewable energy and demand-side electrification for deep decarbonization. The VPP market is projected to have a significant growth potential, with the global investment surging from $6.47 billion in 2022 to $16.90 billion by 2030. Up to now, VPPs still face technical challenges in dealing with the inherent uncertainty of DERs, and data emerge as a promising and essential resource to handle this issue. This paper makes the first effort to review the development of VPP technologies from a data-centric perspective, and then analyze the major role of data within every decision phase of VPPs. We examine the VPP energy management through a data lifecycle lens, and extensively survey the progress in data creation, data communication, data-driven decision support, data sharing and privacy, as well as technical solutions stemming from reinforcement learning, peer-to-peer sharing, blockchain, and market participation. In addition, we offer a unique overview of open data and recent real-world projects around the world to showcase the latest VPP practices. We finally discuss the major challenges and future opportunities in detail, with a focus on topics such as public benchmarks, internet of things, 5G, explainable artificial intelligence, and federated learning. We highlight the need for technical advances in data management and support systems for the growing scale of future VPP systems, and suggest VPPs delivering more ancillary grid services in the future.

AB  - Feature Ensembles are a robust and effective method for finding the feature set that yields the best predictive accuracy for learning agents. However, current feature ensemble algorithms do not consider explainability as a key factor in their construction. To address this limitation, we present an algorithm that optimizes for the explainability and performance of a model - the Optimizing Feature Ensembles for Explainability (OFEE) algorithm. OFEE uses intersections of feature sets to produce a feature ensemble that optimally balances explainability and performance. Furthermore, OFEE is parameter-free and as such optimizes itself to a given dataset and explainability requirements. To evaluated OFEE, we considered two explainability measures, one based on ensemble size and the other based on ensemble stability. We found that OFEE was overall extremely effective within the nine canonical datasets we considered. It outperformed other feature selection algorithms by an average of over 8% and 7% respectively when considering the size and stability explainability measures.

AB  - This study proposes a multivariate time-series classification approach using deep learning to predict stocks likely to be flagged by the Market Surveillance Measure List in the Thai stock market. Formulated as a binary classification problem, the model distinguishes At-Risk and Normal stocks based on two primary datasets: End-of-Day stock prices and Market Surveillance Measure List records, incorporating trading volumes and technical indicators. To address data imbalance, concept drift, and long-term dependencies, the framework integrates feature engineering, cost-sensitive learning, and rolling window training. Experimental results show deep learning models significantly outperform traditional baseline methods in capturing financial risk patterns. The study identifies models that effectively balance predictive accuracy with computational efficiency, with performance varying based on forecasting horizons. Despite improvements from specialized techniques, the study identifies challenges in long-term financial risk prediction. These findings support market surveillance, algorithmic trading, and portfolio risk management, with future work exploring explainable AI, adaptive learning, and alternative data sources to enhance interpretability and long-term forecasting.

AB  - One of the most widely used methods for the seismic retrofit of masonry structures is using anchorage systems. Tensile load (also referred to as pull-out force in this context) is one of the prominent loads applied to embedded anchors. Therefore, it is crucial to analyze and design the anchorage system to resist the pull-out force. Since experimental studies are time-consuming and labor-intensive, AI techniques have recently been successfully adopted to automate the prediction of the maximum pull-out force. While this approach has been successfully applied in concrete, there is still a significant gap in its application to masonry structures. This comprehensive study aims to bridge this gap by proposing suitable machine learning (ML) models and empirical equations that not only predict the pull-out force but also predict the various failure modes of the anchored steel rods in masonry. To achieve this, 13 distinct ML models, including both individual and ensemble models, were implemented for predicting each target variable. Optimization techniques were then used to fine-tune the hyperparameters, improving the performance of each ML model. A comparative study was conducted to evaluate the models against one another. Among all the models, the tuned Voting model, identified as the best for predicting pull-out force, showed an average error of about 3.0 kN and an R2 score of 93%. On the other hand, CatBoost demonstrated a strong performance with an accuracy of 90% and F1-score of about 89% in both the training and test data for predicting the failure modes. Further, Explainable ML (XML) provided valuable insights into the most important features involved in predicting both the pull-out force and failure modes. Moreover, the results showed that the proposed empirical equation produced satisfactory outcomes compared to other existing empirical equations in this context, achieving a total accuracy of 72% and an error of 7.5 kN. As a result of this study, accurate predictive models have been introduced that require only readily available information from any construction site to proceed. Furthermore, by comparing the capability of the XML used in this study with other analytical parametric studies such as finite element analysis, it was found that XML can serve as a suitable alternative for identifying the most important features of the pull-out behavior of metal anchors in masonry.

AB  - Ozone (O3) pollution is a severe air quality issue in China, posing a threat to human health and ecosystems. The climate change will affect O3 levels by directly changing physical and chemical processes of O3 and indirectly changing natural emissions of O3 precursors. In this study, near-surface O3 concentrations in China in 2030 and 2060 are predicted using the process-based interpretable Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model integrated with multi-source data. The results show that the climate-driven O3 levels over eastern China are projected to decrease by more than 0.4 ppb in 2060 under the carbon neutral scenario (SSP1-1.9) compared with the high emission scenario (SSP5-8.5). Among this reduction, 80% is attributed to the changes in physical and chemical processes of O3 related to a cooler climate, while the remaining 20% is attributed to the reduced biogenic isoprene emissions.
   O3 pollution is a severe air quality issue in China that threatens human health and ecosystem. Under the background of climate change, O3 pollution will continue to evolve in the future. Here, we predict near-surface O3 concentrations in China in 2030 and 2060 based on an interpretable machine learning method, integrated with physical and chemical processes of O3, natural emissions of O3 precursors, and other multi-source data. The direct (via changing physical and chemical processes of O3) and indirect (via changing natural emissions of O3 precursors) impacts of future climate change on O3 concentrations are quantitatively analyzed. It demonstrates that the climate-driven O3 levels are projected to decrease by more than 0.4 ppb in 2060 over eastern China under a carbon neutral scenario relative to a high emission scenario. The changes in physical and chemical processes under climate change play a more important role in regulating O3 concentrations in the future than the changes in natural emissions.
   Climate change influences O3 pollution in China through changing physical and chemical processes and natural precursor emissions of O3 Physical and chemical processes play a dominant role in regulating future near-surface O3 concentrations over eastern China Carbon neutral scenario is an ideal pathway for China to mitigate both climate change and O3 pollution in 2060

AB  - The mass manufacturing of high-end mechanical products demands rigorous assembly quality control, but systemic variations in equipment performance, operator interventions, and environmental conditions challenge predefined process parameters' optimality. This necessitates data-driven modeling to establish quantifiable process-quality relationships for adaptive optimization. However, complex manufacturing systems inherently exhibit strong dynamism, limited sample availability, and multimode characteristics, which generate aleatoric, epistemic, and out-of-distribution (OOD) uncertainties in current approaches, particularly deep learning (DL) architectures. Meanwhile, the black-box nature of DL further obscures assembly quality prediction interpretability. Therefore, this study proposes an uncertainty-aware Bayesian neural network (UABNN) integrated with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for data-driven assembly quality prediction. The UABNN quantifies epistemic uncertainty through hierarchical parameter distributions, models aleatoric uncertainty via stochastic residuals, and detects OOD instances using feature perturbation analysis. Additionally, SHAP interpretability correlates uncertainty bounds with feature contributions, enabling global sensitivity analysis and localized defect diagnosis. Validated on industrial datasets from diesel engine assembly lines, the framework demonstrates superior prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification reliability compared to conventional DL approaches. It establishes a reliable process-quality model for optimizing assembly parameters in dynamic environments, addressing the trade-off between model transparency and performance by delivering confidence intervals for predictions and explicit feature contribution rankings.

AB  - The cavity pressure profile representing the effective molding condition in a cavity is closely related to part quality. Analysis of the effect of the cavity pressure profile on quality requires prior knowledge and understanding of the injection-molding process and polymer materials. In this work, an analysis methodology to examine the effect of the cavity pressure profile on part quality is proposed. The methodology uses the interpretation of a neural network as a metamodel representing the relationship between the cavity pressure profile and the part weight as a quality index. The process state points (PSPs) extracted from the cavity pressure profile were used as the input features of the model. The overall impact of the features on the part weight and the contribution of them on a specific sample clarify the influence of the cavity pressure profile on the part weight. The effect of the process parameters on the part weight and the PSPs supported the validity of the methodology. The influential features and impacts analyzed using this methodology can be employed to set the target points and bounds of the monitoring window, and the contribution of each feature can be used to optimize the injection-molding process.

AB  - Traditionally, ASR expansion is determined using experimental and finite element method (FEM) based numerical modelling. However, these methods are time-consuming and computationally costly, which makes ASR prediction challenging. Machine learning (ML) techniques can serve as effective alternatives for the early detection of expansion in concrete structures. In this study, we developed four different machine learning models - extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) to predict the ASR expansion in concrete using a comprehensive dataset with 1896 data points. Each model was evaluated based on the model performance and XGBoost shows the most effective model for predicting the ASR expansion with R2 of 0.99 for training and R2 of 0.98 for testing. After identifying the best-performing model, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) were employed to interpret its predictions. This approach provides insights into the model's decision-making process, clarifying the complex nature of machine learning algorithms. Using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), time and the average size of reactive aggregate were identified as critical parameters influencing ASR expansion. This research holds significant value for the construction industry, as accurately predicting ASR expansion can lead to optimized material usage and improved structural performance.

TI  - Towards novel insights in lattice field theory with explainable machine learning
T2  - PHYSICAL REVIEW D
LA  - English
AB  - Machine learning has the potential to aid our understanding of phase structures in lattice quantum field theories through the statistical analysis of Monte Carlo samples. Available algorithms, in particular those based on deep learning, often demonstrate remarkable performance in the search for previously unidentified features, but tend to lack transparency if applied naively. To address these shortcomings, we propose representation learning in combination with interpretability methods as a framework for the identification of observables. More specifically, we investigate action parameter regression as a pretext task while using layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) to identify the most important observables depending on the location in the phase diagram. The approach is put to work in the context of a scalar Yukawa model in (2 + 1)d. First, we investigate a multilayer perceptron to determine an importance hierarchy of several predefined, standard observables. The method is then applied directly to the raw field configurations using a convolutional network, demonstrating the ability to reconstruct all order parameters from the learned filter weights. Based on our results, we argue that due to its broad applicability, attribution methods such as LRP could prove a useful and versatile tool in our search for new physical insights. In the case of the Yukawa model, it facilitates the construction of an observable that characterizes the symmetric phase.

AB  - The response of vegetation physiology to drought at large spatial scales is poorly understood due to a lack of direct observations. Here, we study vegetation drought responses related to photosynthesis, evaporation, and vegetation water content using remotely sensed data, and we isolate physiological responses using a machine learning technique. We find that vegetation functional decreases are largely driven by the downregulation of vegetation physiology such as stomatal conductance and light use efficiency, with the strongest downregulation in water-limited regions. Vegetation physiological decreases in wet regions also result in a discrepancy between functional and structural changes under severe drought. We find similar patterns of physiological drought response using simulations from a soil-plant-atmosphere continuum model coupled with a radiative transfer model. Observation-derived vegetation physiological responses to drought across space are mainly controlled by aridity and additionally modulated by abnormal hydro-meteorological conditions and vegetation types. Hence, isolating and quantifying vegetation physiological responses to drought enables a better understanding of ecosystem biogeochemical and biophysical feedback in modulating climate change.
   Vegetation resilience to drought is underlain by plant physiological responses. Here, the authors combine remote sensing data, explainable machine learning and model simulations to map global vegetation responses to drought linked to physiological processes such as stomatal regulation and light use efficiency.

AB  - The recent surge of interest in explainability in artificial intelligence (XAI) is propelled by not only technological advancements in machine learning but also by regulatory initiatives to foster transparency in algorithmic decision making. In this article, we revise the current concept of explainability and identify three limitations: passive explainee, narrow view on the social process, and undifferentiated assessment of explainee's understanding. In order to overcome these limitations, we present explanation as a social practice in which explainer and explainee co-construct understanding on the microlevel. We view the co-construction on a microlevel as embedded into a macrolevel, yielding expectations concerning, e.g., social roles or partner models: typically, the role of the explainer is to provide an explanation and to adapt it to the current level of explainee's understanding; the explainee, in turn, is expected to provide cues that direct the explainer. Building on explanations being a social practice, we present a conceptual framework that aims to guide future research in XAI. The framework relies on the key concepts of monitoring and scaffolding to capture the development of interaction. We relate our conceptual framework and our new perspective on explaining to transparency and autonomy as objectives considered for XAI.

AB  - Water availability is a major control of vegetation dynamics and terrestrial carbon cycling. Here, the authors show that vegetation sensitivity to soil moisture has been increasing in the last 36 years, especially in (semi)arid areas, and that state-of-the-art land surface models fail to capture this trend.
   Global vegetation and associated ecosystem services critically depend on soil moisture availability which has decreased in many regions during the last three decades. While spatial patterns of vegetation sensitivity to global soil water have been recently investigated, long-term changes in vegetation sensitivity to soil water availability are still unclear. Here we assess global vegetation sensitivity to soil moisture during 1982-2017 by applying explainable machine learning with observation-based leaf area index (LAI) and hydro-climate anomaly data. We show that LAI sensitivity to soil moisture significantly increases in many semi-arid and arid regions. LAI sensitivity trends are associated with multiple hydro-climate and ecological variables, and strongest increasing trends occur in the most water-sensitive regions which additionally experience declining precipitation. State-of-the-art land surface models do not reproduce this increasing sensitivity as they misrepresent water-sensitive regions and sensitivity strength. Our sensitivity results imply an increasing ecosystem vulnerability to water availability which can lead to exacerbated reductions in vegetation carbon uptake under future intensified drought, consequently amplifying climate change.

AB  - This perspective paper is based on several sessions by the members of the Round Table AI at FIRM1, with input from a number of external and international speakers. Its particular focus lies on the management of the model risk of productive models in banks and other financial institutions. The models in view range from simple rules-based approaches to Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine learning (ML) models with a high level of sophistication. The typical applications of those models are related to predictions and decision making around the value chain of credit risk (including accounting side under IFRS9 or related national GAAP approaches), insurance risk or other financial risk types. We expect more models of higher complexity in the space of anti-money laundering, fraud detection and transaction monitoring as well as a rise of AI/ML models as alternatives to current methods in solving some of the more intricate stochastic differential equations needed for the pricing and/or valuation of derivatives. The same type of model is also successful in areas unrelated to risk management, such as sales optimization, customer lifetime value considerations, robo-advisory, and other fields of applications. The paper refers to recent related publications from central banks, financial supervisors and regulators as well as other relevant sources and working groups. It aims to give practical advice for establishing a risk-based governance and testing framework for the mentioned model types and discusses the use of recent technologies, approaches, and platforms to support the establishment of responsible, trustworthy, explainable, auditable, and manageable AI/ML in production. In view of the recent EU publication on AI, also referred to as the EU Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA), we also see a certain added value for this paper as an instigator of further thinking outside of the financial services sector, in particular where "High Risk " models according to the mentioned EU consultation are concerned.

AB  - The increase in global population and urbanization is presenting significant challenges to society: space is becoming increasingly scarce, demand is exceeding capacity for deteriorating infrastructure, transportation is fraught with congestion, and environmental impacts are accelerating. Underground space, and particularly tunnels, has a key role to play in tackling these challenges. However, the cost, risk, uncertainty, and complexity of the tunneling process have impeded its growth. In this paper, we envision several technological advancements that can potentially innovate and transform the mechanized tunneling industry, including artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous, and bio-inspired systems. The proliferation of AI may assist human engineers and operators in making informed decisions systematically and quantitatively based on massive real-time data during tunneling. Autonomous tunneling systems may enable precise and predictable tunneling operations with minimal human intervention and facilitate the construction of massive and large-scale underground infrastructure projects that were previously challenging or unfeasible using conventional methods. Bio-inspired systems may provide valuable references and strategies for more efficient tunneling design and construction concepts. While these technological advancements can offer great promise, they also face considerable challenges, such as improving accessibility to and shareability of tunneling data, developing robust, reliable, and explainable machine learning systems, as well as scaling the mechanics and ensuring the applicability of bio-inspired systems from the prototype level to real-world applications. Addressing these challenges is imperative to ensure the successful implementation of these innovations for future tunneling.

AB  - Sorghum is a vital crop known for its resilience in harsh environmental conditions, playing a key role in food security and bioenergy production across the globe. Accurate sorghum weed classification is crucial for efficient agricultural management, yet traditional methods are labour-intensive and resource-heavy. This research presents the first work on the sorghum weed classification dataset, introducing a novel deep-learning model using a customised DenseNet-169, enhanced with two innovative feature extraction blocks: Dimensional Convolutional Feature Fusion (DCFF) and Deformable Multi-Kernel Channel Fusion (DMKCF). These blocks improve multi-scale feature extraction and adaptively capture complex patterns from the weed images. The model also integrates Triplet Attention (TA) to refine feature representations and employs Grad-CAM and LIME for visual interpretability, offering insights into the classification process. The proposed network, when tested on the SorghumWeedDataset_Classification, achieved a testing accuracy of 99.07%, surpassing several state-of-the-art CNN models. The proposed model provides a robust solution for sorghum weed classification, advancing agricultural monitoring and management practices. Additionally, the model achieved 100% accuracy for the broad leaf weed class, further underscoring its effectiveness in identifying and classifying sorghum weeds with absolute precision.

AB  - Traditional methods for designing concrete materials typically rely on labor-intensive laboratory experiments, resulting in time and cost inefficiencies. Recently, designing concrete using artificial intelligence (AI) methods has shown high efficiency, but existing AI methods often rely solely on data, which can lead to violation with scientific principles and result in models lacking reasoning abilities. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents an interpretable knowledge graph-guided data-driven design approach. By integrating advanced computing techniques with domain knowledge via knowledge graphs, this approach enables the interpretation of data-driven models and uncovers the underlying mechanisms behind predictions. This approach is applied to ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) involving complex physicochemical reactions. The domain knowledge about UHPC is imparted using a knowledge graph, and UHPC properties are predicted using a machine learning model considering mixing proportions, processing methods, and physiochemical properties of materials via natural language processing. The results show that the knowledge graph displays crucial design variables and their effects on UHPC properties, aiding in selecting variables for machine learning models and interpreting their results. The prediction accuracy of the machine learning model reached 0.95. The research paves the way for more transparent and scientific AI models for material design and AI-enabled discovery of scientific knowledge.

AB  - Cauliflower cultivation is subject to high-quality control criteria during sales, which underlines the importance of accurate harvest timing. Using time series data for plant phenotyping can provide insights into the dynamic development of cauliflower and allow more accurate predictions of when the crop is ready for harvest than single-time observations. However, data acquisition on a daily or weekly basis is resource-intensive, making selection of acquisition days highly important. We investigate which data acquisition days and development stages positively affect the model accuracy to get insights into prediction-relevant observation days and aid future data acquisition planning. We analyze harvest-readiness using the cauliflower image time series of the GrowliFlower dataset. We use an adjusted ResNet18 classification model, including positional encoding of the data acquisition dates to add implicit information about development. The explainable machine learning approach GroupSHAP analyzes time points' contributions. Time points with the lowest mean absolute contribution are excluded from the time series to determine their effect on model accuracy. Using image time series rather than single time points, we achieve an increase in accuracy of 4%. GroupSHAP allows the selection of time points that positively affect the model accuracy. By using seven selected time points instead of all 11 ones, the accuracy improves by an additional 4%, resulting in an overall accuracy of 89.3%. The selection of time points may therefore lead to a reduction in data collection in the future.

AB  - The interaction between sunlight and drugs can lead to phototoxicity in patients who have received such drugs. Phototoxicity assessment is a regulatory requirement globally and one of the main toxicity screening steps in the early stages of drug discovery. An in silico-in vitro approach has been utilized mainly for toxicology assessments at these stages. Although several quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for phototoxicity have been developed, in silico technology to evaluate phototoxicity has not been well established. In this study, we attempted to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict the in vitro Neutral Red Uptake Phototoxicity Test results from a chemical struc-ture and its derived information. To accomplish this, we utilized an open-source software library, kMoL. kMoL employs a graph convolutional neural networks (GCN) approach, which allows it to learn the data for the specified chemical structure. kMoL also utilizes the integrated gradient (IG) method, enabling it to visually display the substructures contributing to any positive results. To construct this AI model, we used only the chemical structure as a basis, then added the descriptors and the HOMO-LUMO gap, which was obtained from quantum chemical calculations. As a result, the assortment of chemical structures and the HOMO-LUMO gap produced an AI model with high discrimination performance, and an F1 score of 0.857. Additionally, our AI model could visualize the substructures involved in phototoxicity using the IG method. Our AI model can be applied as a toxicity screening method and could enhance productivity in drug development.

To decrease absenteeism, it is imperative to understand its underlying causes and to identify susceptible employee subgroups. Most research studies apply hypotheses testing and regression models to identify features that are correlated with absenteeism-typically, these models are limited to finding simple correlations. We illustrate the use of interpretable classification algorithms for uncovering subgroups of employees with common characteristics and a similar level of absenteeism. This process may assist human resource managers in understanding the underlying reasons for absenteeism, which, in turn, could stimulate measures to decrease it. Our proposed methodology makes use of an objective-based information gain measure in conjunction with an ordinal CART model. Our results indicate that the ordinal CART model outperforms conventional classifiers and, more importantly, identifies patterns in the data that have not been revealed by other models. We demonstrate the importance of interpretability for human resource management through three examples. The main contributions of this research are (1) the development of an information-based ordinal classifier for a published absenteeism dataset and (2) the illustration of an interpretable approach that could be of considerable value in supporting human resource management decision-making.

AB  - Agricultural expansion and forest loss (AEFL) continues to threaten tropical ecosystems. While previous studies have examined AEFL at national scales or over short timeframes, the long-term, province-level dynamics and driving forces of AEFL remain poorly characterized. This study employs interpretable machine learning to explore AEFL dynamics in Southeast Asia across three decades (1992-2002, 2002-2012, 2012-2022) at the provincial scale. As a global hotspot for agro-deforestation, Southeast Asia's forest-to-agriculture transitions were analyzed using 12 factors spanning biophysical conditions, socioeconomic development, and agricultural land status. Key findings include: (1) AEFL was widespread, with total converted areas of 6.28, 7.73, and 5.95 million ha respectively. Indonesia exhibited the highest conversion rates, followed by Malaysia. Spatiotemporal trends diverged: slowdowns dominated the Indochina Peninsula, whereas acceleration occurred in the Malay Archipelago. (2) Agricultural land scale emerged as the dominant driver, with contribution rates increasing from 24.80 % to 44.13 %. (3) Land fragmentation, climate, soil quality, and agricultural intensification significantly influenced AEFL. High rainfall zones and fertile soils were more vulnerable to conversion, while fragmented landscapes were significantly associated with AEFL. Conversely, agricultural intensification mitigated forest loss. These results enable policymakers to design spatially targeted strategies balancing agricultural productivity and forest conservation, advancing the sustainable development goals.

AB  - Objective: This study aims to develop an interpretable machine learning (ML) model to accurately predict the probability of achieving total pathological complete response (tpCR) in patients with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Methods: This multi-center retrospective study included pre-NAC clinical pathology data from 698 LABC patients. Post-operative pathological outcomes divided patients into tpCR and non-tpCR groups. Data from 586 patients at Shanghai Ruijin Hospital were randomly assigned to a training set (80%) and a test set (20%). In comparison, data from our hospital's remaining 112 patients were used for external validation. Variable selection was performed using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression analysis. Predictive models were constructed using six ML algorithms: decision trees, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine, light gradient boosting machine, and extreme gradient boosting. Model efficacy was assessed through various metrics, including receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, precision-recall (PR) curves, confusion matrices, calibration plots, and decision curve analysis (DCA). The best-performing model was selected by comparing the performance of different algorithms. Moreover, variable relevance was ranked using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) technique to improve the interpretability of the model and solve the "black box" problem. Results: A total of 191 patients (32.59%) achieved tpCR following NAC. Through LASSO regression analysis, five variables were identified as predictive factors for model construction, including tumor size, Ki-67, molecular subtype, targeted therapy, and chemotherapy regimen. The KNN model outperformed the other five classifier algorithms, achieving area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.847 (95% CI: 0.809-0.883) in the training set, 0.763 (95% CI: 0.670-0.856) in the test set, and 0.665 (95% CI: 0.555-0.776) in the external validation set. DCA demonstrated that the KNN model yielded the highest net advantage through a wide range of threshold probabilities in both the training and test sets. Furthermore, the analysis of the KNN model utilizing SHAP technology demonstrated that targeted therapy is the most crucial factor in predicting tpCR. Conclusion: An ML prediction model using clinical and pathological data collected before NAC was developed and verified. This model accurately predicted the probability of achieving a tpCR in patients with LABC after receiving NAC. SHAP technology enhanced the interpretability of the model and assisted in clinical decision-making and therapy optimization.

AB  - Learning from complex real-life networks is a lively research area, with recent advances in learning information-rich, low-dimensional network node representations. However, state-of-the-art methods are not necessarily interpretable and are therefore not fully applicable to sensitive settings in biomedical or user profiling tasks, where explicit bias detection is highly relevant. The proposed SNoRe (Symbolic Node Representations) algorithm is capable of learning symbolic, human-understandable representations of individual network nodes, based on the similarity of neighborhood hashes which serve as features. SNoRe's interpretable features are suitable for direct explanation of individual predictions, which we demonstrate by coupling it with the widely used instance explanation tool SHAP to obtain nomograms representing the relevance of individual features for a given classification. To our knowledge, this is one of the first such attempts in a structural node embedding setting. In the experimental evaluation on eleven real-life datasets, SNoRe proved to be competitive to strong baselines, such as variational graph autoencoders, node2vec and LINE. The vectorized implementation of SNoRe scales to large networks, making it suitable for contemporary network learning and analysis tasks.

AB  - Glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) elastic gridshells consist of long continuous GFRP tubes that form elastic deformations. In this paper, a method for the form-finding of gridshell structures is presented based on the interpretable machine learning (ML) approaches. A comparative study is conducted on several ML algorithms, including support vector regression (SVR), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), AdaBoost, XGBoost, category boosting (CatBoost), and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM). A numerical example is presented using a standard double-hump gridshell considering two characteristics of deformation as objective functions. The combination of the grid search approach and k-fold cross-validation (CV) is implemented for fine-tuning the parameters of ML models. The results of the comparative study indicate that the LightGBM model presents the highest prediction accuracy. Finally, interpretable ML approaches, including Shapely additive explanations (SHAP), partial dependence plot (PDP), and accumulated local effects (ALE), are applied to explain the predictions of the ML model since it is essential to understand the effect of various values of input parameters on objective functions. As a result of interpretability approaches, an optimum gridshell structure is obtained and new opportunities are verified for form-finding investigation of GFRP elastic gridshells during lifting construction.

AB  - The roughness of the soil surface directly affects seedbed preparation, sowing operations and crop yield. The roughness of the soil surface depends on the equipment used in the tillage process. Evaluating the performance of this equipment is important for increasing agricultural productivity. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and image processing technologies use convolutional neural network (CNN) models that can automatically learn meaningful patterns from images, enabling the objective analysis of soil surface roughness. Rather than analyzing a single CNN model, ensemble deep learning (EDL) approaches combining predictions from multiple CNN models improve classification accuracy. The aim of this study is to classify soil surface images obtained from primary tillage operations performed with a newly developed mouldboard ploughshare (NDP) and a conventional mouldboard ploughshare (CP) using the EDL method. Images were taken from the field to evaluate the soil surface structure using NDP and CP after primary tillage. These images were then enhanced using the gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) method to generate heat maps, and the generated images were classified using known CNN and EDL models. The hard voting technique was used for the EDL approach. The Voting 6 model achieved 98.3 % accuracy. In addition, according to the results of the profilometer measurement, it was determined that the soil cutting and fragmentation performance of NDP was higher than that of CP. As a result, this image-based method can significantly contribute to the testing process of primary tillage tools.

AB  - The proliferation of classification-capable artificial intelligence (AI) across a wide range of domains (e.g., agriculture, construction, etc.) has been allowed to optimize and complement several tasks, typically operationalized by humans. The computational training that allows providing such support is frequently hindered by various challenges related to datasets, including the scarcity of examples and imbalanced class distributions, which have detrimental effects on the production of accurate models. For a proper approach to these challenges, strategies smarter than the traditional brute force-based K-fold cross-validation or the naivety of hold-out are required, with the following main goals in mind: (1) carrying out one-shot, close-to-optimal data arrangements, accelerating conventional training optimization; and (2) aiming at maximizing the capacity of inference models to its fullest extent while relieving computational burden. To that end, in this paper, two image-based feature-aware dataset splitting approaches are proposed, hypothesizing a contribution towards attaining classification models that are closer to their full inference potential. Both rely on strategic image harvesting: while one of them hinges on weighted random selection out of a feature-based clusters set, the other involves a balanced picking process from a sorted list that stores data features' distances to the centroid of a whole feature space. Comparative tests on datasets related to grapevine leaves phenotyping and bridge defects showcase promising results, highlighting a viable alternative to K-fold cross-validation and hold-out methods.

AB  - We introduce the concept of an epsilon-semimetric that satisfies the same axioms as a topological metric, except for an arbitrarily small allowance to violate the triangle inequality. Under this modification, we demonstrate the possibility of taking arbitrary points in space, assigning arbitrary desired distances between them (independent of their geometric location relative to each other, that is, independent of their "features"), and constructing an epsilon-semimetric that measures exactly the desired distances in the point cloud. This results in a threat to fairness and objectiveness in applications of clustering algorithms: suppose that an adversary subjectively classifies people according to its whim or discriminatory preferences. Upon accusations of unethical behavior, the malicious data processor can plausibly deny these as follows: it designs a distance function (an epsilon-semimetric) that is (up to a fully controllable numeric "round-off-error" epsilon) equivalent to a standard distance like the Euclidean. However, this crafted distance will exactly reproduce the (malicious) results and thus confirm them while pretending objectivity and transparency, since only standard and explainable artificial intelligence was used. This demonstration works without any data poisoning. We illustrate the method on randomly chosen points with stochastically independent random classifications assigned to them. Then, we apply standard implementations of k-Means and DBSCAN on the data points, which both exactly reproduce the desired (randomly chosen) classes. We also discuss non-adversarial applications of epsilon-semimetrics, and corroborate the construction with examples and implementation in Octave.

AB  - A comfortable outdoor environment, like its indoor counterpart, can significantly enhance the quality of life and improve the physical and mental health of elderly populations. Urban spatial morphology is one of the key factors influencing outdoor environmental performance. To explore the interactions between urban spatial morphology and the outdoor environment for the elderly, this study utilized parametric tools to establish a performance-driven workflow based on a "morphology generation-performance evaluation-morphology optimization" framework. Using survey data from 340 elderly neighborhoods in Beijing, a parametric urban morphology generation model was constructed. The following three optimization objectives were set: maximizing the winter pedestrian Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI), minimizing the summer pedestrian UTCI, and maximizing sunlight hours. Multi-objective optimization was conducted using a genetic algorithm, generating a "morphology-performance" dataset. Subsequently, the XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) explainable machine learning algorithms were applied to uncover the nonlinear relationships among variables. The results indicate that optimizing spatial morphology significantly enhances environmental performance. For the summer elderly UTCI, the contributing morphological indicators include the Shape Coefficient (SC), Standard Deviation of Building Area (SA), and Deviation of Building Volume (SV), while the inhibitory indicators include the average building height (AH), Average Building Volume (AV), Mean Building Area (MA), and floor-area ratio (FAR). For the winter elderly UTCI, the contributing indicators include the AH, Volume-Area Ratio (VAR), and FAR, while the inhibitory indicators include the SC and porosity (PO). The morphological indicators contributing to sunlight hours are not clearly identified in the model, but the inhibitory indicators for sunlight hours include the AH, MA, and FAR. This study identifies the morphological indicators influencing environmental performance and provides early-stage design strategies for age-friendly neighborhood layouts, reducing the cost of later-stage environmental performance optimization.

AB  - Data-driven design of concrete attracts increasing interests in waste valorization and decarbonization but lacks generalizability and reliability without concrete domain knowledge. Recent research suggests that knowledge graphs are promising for imparting concrete knowledge into data-driven design, yet manual construction of knowledge graphs is inefficient and hard to scale. This paper presents a multi-agent collaboration framework to streamline knowledge-guided data-driven design of green concrete. The framework decentralize design tasks among specialized agents, and a large language model-based approach is developed to automate the extraction of concrete knowledge for constructing concrete knowledge graphs. The framework has been applied to create a knowledge graph and design green ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC). The primary novelties of this research involve the multi-agent collaboration framework for designing UHPC and the automatic extraction of UHPC knowledge for constructing the knowledge graph. Results show that concrete knowledge is imparted into data-driven design of UHPC and enables explicit interpretation of machine learning outcomes regarding physical and chemical mechanisms, advancing the transition from purely data-driven to knowledge-guided design of ecofriendly composite materials.

AB  - Addressing escalating land use conflicts (LUCs) is critical for sustainable development in resource-scarce, transboundary regions. The Aral Sea Basin (ASB), Central Asia's largest transboundary basin characterized by arid conditions and vulnerable ecosystems, serves as a crucial case study. This research introduces an innovative framework, integrating multi-scale spatial assessments with interpretable machine learning (XGBoost-SHAP), to overcome limitations of previous fragmented analyses and provide deeper insights into LUCs dynamics. We systematically evaluated land suitability for ecological preservation, agriculture, and urban construction, quantified conflict intensity, and identified key drivers across the entire ASB, including its Amu Darya and Syr Darya sub-basins. Quantitative results reveal profound spatial heterogeneity in land use potential, with 56.29% of the basin suitable for ecological preservation, only 6.54% for agriculture, and 72.67% for urban construction-indicating dominant ecological value, limited agricultural suitability, and high urban development pressure. Conflicts were found to be pervasive and intense, driven by a complex interplay of natural factors and socio-economic pressures, with distinct upstream-downstream patterns across sub-basins. Crucially, this study provides spatially explicit evidence highlighting the urgent need for integrated, transboundary land management. The results offer actionable, data-driven insights essential for designing targeted strategies, fostering collaborative resource governance, and ultimately promoting sustainable development pathways that balance ecological integrity with human needs in the ASB and similar complex transboundary basins worldwide.

AB  - Crispy tilapia has become a popular aquatic product due to its unique texture and high market demand. However, fillets at different stages of crispness vary significantly in nutritional value and taste, directly affecting product quality and consumer experience. Therefore, rapid and accurate identification of the crispness of tilapia fillets is crucial for farmers, traders and consumers. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) technology has emerged as a powerful tool in food quality testing, offering rich spectral information that can be leveraged for detailed analysis. In this study, we propose a method combining HSI and dual-branch convolutional neural network (DBCNN) for classifying tilapia fillets at different stages of crispness. By separately processing VNIR and SWIR data and fusing them in the feature space, the DB-CNN achieved 95.74 % classification accuracy, outperforming traditional fusion methods. Grad-CAM++ visualization validated the model's recognition of key spectral features. This approach offers an effective solution for authenticity identification and quality control of crispy tilapia fillets and showcases its potential for broader applications in food and aquatic product classification.

AB  - We are concerned with the construction, formal verification, and safety assurance of dependable multiagent systems. For the case where the system (agents and their environment) can be explicitly modelled, we develop formal verification methods over several logic languages, such as temporal epistemic logic and strategy logic, to reason about the knowledge and strategy of the agents. For the case where the system cannot be explicitly modelled, we study multiagent deep reinforcement learning, aiming to develop efficient and scalable learning methods for cooperative multiagent tasks. In addition to these, we develop (both formal and simulation-based) verification methods for the neural network based perception agent that is trained with supervised learning, considering its safety and robustness against attacks from an adversarial agent, and other approaches (such as explainable AI, reliability assessment, and safety argument) for the analysis and assurance of the learning components. Our ultimate objective is to combine formal methods, machine learning, and reliability engineering to not only develop dependable learning-enabled multiagent systems but also provide rigorous methods for the verification and assurance of such systems.

AB  - Rotating machinery plays an essential role in various industrial processes such as manufacturing, power generation, and transportation. These machines, which include turbines, pumps, motors, compressors, and many others, are the heartbeats of numerous industries. The seamless operation of these machines is critical for the efficiency and productivity of these sectors. However, over time, these machines degrade and can suffer faults. One of the most critical components are bearings, which can suffer different types of faults. This paper presents a novel approach for bearing fault classification and diagnosis under limited data. A Monotonic Smoothed Stacked AutoEncoder (MS2AE) is used to infer a smoothed monotonic health index from raw bearing acceleration data. The MS2AE is trained using only healthy data, so this approach can also be used with recently comisioned equipment that has not failed yet. Then, using the evolution of the health index, a first faulty point is computed, so two stages are identified in the lifespan of the rotating machinery: healthy and faulty. Correlation matrices are computed to show the relationship of the health index with time-domain and frequency-domain features in order to provide explainability and validate the health index construction process. When the health index is classified as faulty, Dynamic Time Warping is applied between healthy samples and faulty samples to extract differences. Finally, based on a 1/3-binary tree 3 level kurtogram, these differences are filtered using a bandpass filter and converted to the frequency domain, where characteristic harmonics are used to identify the type of bearing fault. The explainability provided in the health index construction process makes the system useful in certain industries where black-box AI models cannot be trusted due to strict regulations. The classification and diagnosis system achieves robustness in fault classification under different working conditions by utilizing multiple bearing fault datsets. Its ability to be trained using only healthy data and the interpretability offered, makes it suitable for recently installed rotating machinery in real industrial facilities, without requiring qualified staff.

AB  - Continuous generating grinding plays an essential role in modern gear manufacturing, while the increasing need for high-quality gear products pushes the quality control of the grinding process. This paper proposed a vibration-based process monitoring method to classify faults generated during grinding processes. Gear grinding measurements have been conducted during experiments with different parameters of the feed rate, infeed, and gear eccentricity. The grinding vibration signals have been gathered to form a dataset with seven gear quality categories. A novel deep learning model is presented in this paper exploiting the power of Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD) and Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN). The WPD is adopted to transform the vibration signal into 2D time-frequency representations, used as inputs to the DCNN model for classification. Experimental results show that, the proposed DCNN can achieve a high classification accuracy of 95.83%, demonstrating the methodology's efficiency. In addition, this paper exploits the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Map (Grad-CAM) technique to interpret the deep neural network's decisions in order to facilitate the model deployment in industrial production. The Grad-CAM visualizations are utilized to show the activation regions on the spectrograms, which further indicate that the attentions of the DCNN have a strong correlation with the manufacturing parameters of different grinding passes.

AB  - Soil salinization affects agricultural productivity and ecosystem health in Xinjiang, especially in arid areas. The region's complex topography and limited agricultural data emphasize the pressing need for effective, large-scale monitoring technologies. Therefore, 1044 soil samples were collected from arid farmland in northern Xinjiang, and the potential effectiveness of soil salinity monitoring was explored by combining environmental variables with Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2. The study applied four types of feature selection algorithms: Random Forest (RF), Competitive Adaptive Reweighted Sampling (CARS), Uninformative Variable Elimination (UVE), and Successive Projections Algorithm (SPA). These variables are then integrated into various machine learning models-such as Ensemble Tree (ETree), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and LightBoost-as well as deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Residual Networks (ResNet), Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), for modeling. The results suggest that fertilizer use plays a critical role in soil salinization processes. Notably, the interpretable model KAN achieved an accuracy of 0.75 in correctly classifying the degree of soil salinity. This study highlights the potential of integrating multi-source remote sensing data with deep learning technologies, offering a pathway to large-scale soil salinity monitoring, and thereby providing valuable support for soil management.

AB  - While global vegetation shows widespread greening under climate change, the corresponding impacts on Net Ecosystem Production (NEP)-particularly the divergent responses between drylands and non-drylands-remain poorly understood. In this study, based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF), Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), and NEP, we analyzed the spatiotemporal dynamics of vegetation photosynthesis and NEP across Eurasia from 1982 to 2018, and explored their differential responses to environmental factors, with particular focus on the contrasting mechanisms between drylands and non-drylands. The results showed that the rate of increase in NEP standardized anomalies (0.004 yr(-1), p < 0.05) lagged behind NDVI/SIF/GPP standardized anomalies (0.009 - 0.014 yr(-1), p < 0.01), particularly after 2000, and it was more pronounced in drylands. Spatially, vegetation photosynthesis and NEP changed asynchronously in nearly one-third of Eurasia, with a slightly higher proportion in non-dryland areas and the most obvious patterns in forests and croplands. Explainable machine learning analysis revealed that this asynchrony was primarily driven by interactions among temperature, vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and evapotranspiration. Vegetation photosynthesis was mainly influenced by evapotranspiration, while NEP was constrained by increased VPD. Moreover, in drylands, NEP was highly sensitive to atmospheric moisture, whereas in non-drylands, temperature fluctuations played a dominant role. These findings offer important insights for regional carbon sequestration management and climate change adaptation strategies.

AB  - Hyperbox-based machine learning algorithms are an important and popular branch of machine learning in the construction of classifiers using fuzzy sets and logic theory and neural network architectures. This type of learning is characterised by many strong points of modern predictors such as a high scalability, explainability, online adaptation, effective learning from a small amount of data, native ability to deal with missing data and accommodating new classes. Nevertheless, there is no comprehensive existing package for hyperbox-based machine learning which can serve as a benchmark for research and allow non-expert users to apply these algorithms easily. The hyperboxbrain is an open-source Python library implementing the leading hyperbox-based machine learning algorithms. This library exposes a unified API which closely follows and is compatible with the renowned scikit-learn and numpy toolboxes. The library may be installed from Python Package Index (PyPI) and the conda package manager and is distributed under the GPL-3 license.

AB  - Environmental regulation (ENR) has become a crucial means of achieving environmental goals and managing environmental risks; however, its impact on urban ecological resilience (ER) requires further investigation. Based on panel data from 41 cities in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) from 2010 to 2022, this study reveals the spatiotemporal evolution of ER. ER levels in the YRD increased from 0.5186 to 0.6285, with overall higher levels in Zhejiang, southern Anhui, and central and southern Jiangsu. Using ER as the dependent variable and ENR as the core explanatory variable, along with the control variables, the present study trained an XGBoost model optimized via grid search and cross-validation. The SHapley Additive exPlanations explanatory framework was further applied to analyze the impact of ENR on ER. The findings suggest that ENR contributes 12.5 % to ER, with a pronounced threshold effect. When the ENR index exceeds 0.8 %, its positive impact begins to appear and increases significantly. Interaction analysis further demonstrated that the synergistic effect of ENR and factors such as IS, URB and PIA enhanced ER substantially. This study provides new empirical evidence for understanding the mechanisms via which ENR influences ER and offers theoretical support for optimizing environmental policies.

AB  - Background: Although immune microenvironment-related chemokines, extracellular matrix (ECM), and intrahepatic immune cells are reported to be highly involved in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related diseases, their roles in diagnosis, prognosis, and drug sensitivity evaluation remain unclear. Here, we aimed to study their clinical use to provide a basis for precision medicine in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) via the amalgamation of artificial intelligence.Methods: High-throughput liver transcriptomes from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), NODE (), the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and our in-house hepatocellular carcinoma patients were collected in this study. Core immunosignals that participated in the entire diseases course of hepatitis B were explored using the "Gene set variation analysis " R package. Using ROC curve analysis, the impact of core immunosignals and amino acid utilization related gene on hepatocellular carcinoma patient's clinical outcome were calculated. The utility of core immunosignals as a classifier for hepatocellular carcinoma tumor tissue was evaluated using explainable machine-learning methods. A novel deep residual neural network model based on immunosignals was constructed for the long-term overall survival (LS) analysis. In vivo drug sensitivity was calculated by the "oncoPredict " R package.Results: We identified nine genes comprising chemokines and ECM related to hepatitis B virus-induced inflammation and fibrosis as CLST signals. Moreover, CLST was co-enriched with activated CD4+ T cells bearing harmful factors (aCD4) during all stages of hepatitis B virus pathogenesis, which was also verified by our hepatocellular carcinoma data. Unexpectedly, we found that hepatitis B virus-hepatocellular carcinoma patients in the CLST(high)aCD4(high) subgroup had the shortest overall survival (OS) and were characterized by a risk gene signature associated with amino acids utilization. Importantly, characteristic genes specific to CLST/aCD4 showed promising clinical relevance in identifying patients with early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma via explainable machine learning. In addition, the 5-year long-term overall survival of hepatocellular carcinoma patients can be effectively classified by CLST/aCD4 based GeneSet-ResNet model. Subgroups defined by CLST and aCD4 were significantly involved in the sensitivity of hepatitis B virus-hepatocellular carcinoma patients to chemotherapy treatments.Conclusion: CLST and aCD4 are hepatitis B virus pathogenesis-relevant immunosignals that are highly involved in hepatitis B virus-induced inflammation, fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Gene set variation analysis derived immunogenomic signatures enabled efficient diagnostic and prognostic model construction. The clinical application of CLST and aCD4 as indicators would be beneficial for the precision management of hepatocellular carcinoma.

AB  - Aims This study aims to develop explainable machine learning models and clinical tools for predicting mortality in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) with heart failure (HF).
   Methods Patients diagnosed with HF who experienced their first ICU stay lasting between 24 h and 28 days were selected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality within 28 days. Data analysis was performed using Python and R, with feature selection conducted via least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. Fifteen models were evaluated, and the most effective model was rendered explainable through the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) approach. A nomogram was developed based on logistic regression to facilitate interpretation. For external validation, the eICU database was utilized.
   Results After selection, the study included 2343 records, with 1808 surviving and 535 deceased patients. The median age of the study population was 70.00, with similar to 3/5 males (60.31%). The median length of stay in the ICU was 6.00 days. The median age of the survival group was younger than the non-survival group (69.00 vs. 73.00), and non-survival patients spent longer time in the ICU. Seventy-five features were initially selected, including basic information, vital signs, laboratory tests, haemodynamics and oxygen status. LASSO regression determined the shrinkage parameter alpha = 0.020, and 44 features were chosen for model construction. The linear discriminant analysis (LDA) model showed the best performance, and the accuracy reached 0.8354 in the training cohort and 0.8563 in the testing cohort. It showed satisfying area under the curve (AUC), recall, precision, F1 score, Cohen's kappa score and Matthew's correlation coefficient. The concordance index (c-index) reached 0.7972 in the training cohort and 0.8125 in the testing cohort. In external validation, the LDA model achieved approximately 0.9 in accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score, with an AUC of 0.79. Univariable analysis was performed in the training cohort. Features that differed significantly between the survival and non-survival groups were subjected to multiple logistic regression. The nomogram built on multiple logistic regression included 14 features and demonstrated excellent performance. The AUC of the nomogram is 0.852 in the training cohort, 0.855 in the internal validation cohort and 0.770 in the external validation cohort. The calibration curve showed good consistency.
   Conclusions The study developed an LDA and a nomogram model for predicting mortality in HF patients in the ICU. The SHAP approach was employed to elucidate the LDA model, enhancing its utility for clinicians. These models were made accessible online for clinical application.

AB  - Recent advancements in machine learning enable accurate prediction of concrete's mechanical properties, offering efficiency in data analysis and reducing material waste in civil engineering. What sets this study apart from the literature is the simultaneous prediction of Compressive, Tensile, and Flexural Strength for reinforced concrete (SFRC). This integrated prediction could streamline the material selection process, enhance the durability of concrete structures, and improve performance in real-world applications such as pavements, bridges, and industrial floors. Unique variables like fiber length and content are among the input variables for predictions, which may lead to more cost-effective structural solutions. In this study, base models of the Ridge Regression and Quantile Regression were cross-validated, and the best folds of the compiled dataset for training and testing models were selected. The Sled Dog Optimizer, as a recently developed strong optimization algorithm, is utilized for fine-tuning hyperparameters of the models and enhancing prediction performance. Also, the Bayesian model combination method was employed to develop a hybrid ensemble model for reliably predicting concrete strengths by combining the capabilities of both hybrid models. Such hybrid and ensemble models are rare in the literature in this field. Also, SHAP-based explainable AI utilized for interpreting importance of variables in predictions. The hybrid ensemble model performed best in predicting Compressive Strength, achieving the lowest RMSE (3.295 MPa) and highest R2 (0.974). For Flexural and Tensile Strength, it attained R2 values of 0.986 and 0.974, respectively, with 90% and 100% of predictions showing errors below 10%. Among hybrid models, RRSD excelled, with R2 values of 0.94 for Compressive Strength and 0.98 for Flexural and Tensile Strength. These results demonstrate the reliability of machine learning for modeling SFRC properties.

AB  - To effectively capture and explain complex, nonlinear relationships within bicycle crash frequency data and account for unobserved heterogeneity simultaneously, this study proposes a new hybrid framework that combines the Random Forest-based SHapley Additive exPlanations (RF-SHAP) method with a random parameter negative binomial regression model (RPNB). First, four machine learning algorithms, including random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), gradient boosting machine (GBM), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), were compared for variable importance calculation. The RF algorithm, demonstrating the best performance, was selected and integrated into an interpretable machine learning-based method (i.e., RF-SHAP) to provide an interpretable measure of each variable's impact, which is critical for understanding the model's predictions results. Finally, the RF-SHAP method was combined with the RPNB model to explore individualspecific variations that influence crash frequency predictions. Using 288 traffic analysis zones (TAZs) in Greater London and various regional risk factors for bicycle crash frequency, the proposed framework was validated. The results indicate that the proposed framework demonstrates improved prediction accuracy and better factor interpretation in analyzing bicycle crash frequency. The model exhibits consistent Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) values, indicating its reliable explanatory power. Furthermore, there is a significant improvement in the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). This suggests that the proposed model effectively combines the explanatory power of statistical models with the forecasting powers of data-driven models. The interpretability of SHAP values, coupled with the causal insights from RPNB, provides policymakers with actionable information to develop targeted interventions.

AB  - Introduction: Pedestrianization promotes active modes of transportation and provides many benefits related to the environment, economy, health, and mobility. Nonetheless, it has often faced widespread opposition from residents and business owners. Therefore, it is essential to examine the effectiveness of pedestrianization programs (i.e., transforming streets into car-free zones). Objectives: This study investigates the influence of different variables on pedestrianization effectiveness in Montreal, Canada. The effectiveness of pedestrianization is evaluated in terms of frequency and duration of walking trips, duration spent in street shops, and route change. Methods: An online survey was distributed in Montreal. A powerful machine learning method (XGBoost) is used for modeling, and two interpretation techniques (SHapley Additive exPlanations and Partial Dependence Plots) are used to interpret the results of XGBoost. The performance of the developed interpretable machine learning approach is compared with Ordinal Logistic Regression. Results: The top variables impacting the effectiveness of pedestrianization are the level of agreement in redoing pedestrianization projects every year, the opinion on the influence of pedestrianization on individual mobility, the level of satisfaction with urban furniture of pedestrian streets, the level of satisfaction with the attractiveness of pedestrian streets, and age. Conclusions: Positive attitudes toward pedestrianization and active travel satisfaction are the top determining factors in supporting pedestrianization, and they play a vital role in the effectiveness of pedestrianization programs. Therefore, improving the urban furniture and the attractiveness of car-free streets increases the effectiveness of these projects. Among socio-demographics, age is the top variable, and pedestrianization is the most effective for individuals between 33 and 45 years. Accordingly, policymakers should prioritize the implementation of such projects in areas with the highest concentration of this age group to maximize their effectiveness. Further, travel behavior changes are highly dependent on the trip purpose and the built environment.

AB  - Ultrasonic metal welding (UMW) is a solid-state joining technology with widespread industrial applications. While UMW has numerous important advantages compared to traditional fusion-based welding methods, its performance can be substantially influenced by process anomalies such as tool degradation and material surface contamination, which are commonly encountered in industrial-scale productions. Recently, online monitoring has demonstrated excellent anomaly detection capabilities. However, the existing monitoring algorithms require a large amount of labeled data and lack the generalizability or adaptability to new process configurations (i.e., domains). This paper develops a meta-learning-based explainable few-shot learning (XFSL) framework that enables highly data-efficient adaptation of online monitoring algorithms to new process configurations with excellent explainability. We consider two distinct types of problems including tool condition monitoring and workpiece surface condition classification with varying UMW configurations. Using experimental data, we demonstrate that the proposed XFSL method achieves high classification performance in previously unseen target domains and significantly outperforms baseline methods. Furthermore, XFSL is able to evaluate the importance of each feature, thus revealing key features, feature types, and signal frequencies. It is shown that explainability-based feature selection can effectively eliminate unimportant information from monitoring signals while maintaining and even improving prediction performance. The proposed XFSL method is extensible to other manufacturing applications and holds significant potential for advancing the generalizability, adaptability, and agility of decision-making algorithms in modern manufacturing.

AB  - Agroecosystems have significant potential for carbon sequestration and are highly influenced by anthropogenic factors. However, the differences in carbon sink capacities between irrigated and rainfed agroecosystems, along with their underlying driving mechanisms, remain poorly understood. This study employed Innovative Trend Analysis and Breaks for Additive Seasonal and Trend to examine the trend characteristics and disparities in Net Ecosystem Productivity (NEP) across various global classifications of irrigated and rainfed agriculture. Advanced multi-model coupling techniques, such as Extreme Gradient Boosting, SHapley Additive exPlanations, and Generalized Additive Models, were utilized to explore the non-linear relationships between Net Primary Productivity (NPP), Heterotrophic Respiration (Rh), and NEP with crucial explanatory variables. These models also helped identify positive and negative influence threshold effects and potential driving mechanisms. The results revealed an overall increasing trend (0.38 gC center dot m- 2 center dot year- 1) in NEP across cropland in most regions (68.6%) globally from 1981 to 2019. On average, rainfed cropland exhibited higher NEP than irrigated cropland, although the annual rate of NEP increase was more significant for irrigated cropland. Notably, the largest abrupt changes in NEP across many cropland regions (65.0%) affected the asymptotic trends in subsequent years but did not reverse the direction of the preceding trends. The relationship between NEP and explanatory variables is predominantly non-linear, varying significantly across seasons and cropland types. Irrigation modifies the thresholds for both positive and negative effects of driving drivers on NEP. The intrinsic indicators, NPP and Rh, contribute 62.1% and -37.9%, respectively, to changes in NEP. Human activities (73.2%) emerged as the primary influence on NEP, followed by atmospheric CO2 concentrations (18.1%), with climate change (-3.3%) and vegetation dynamics (5.3%) having a lesser impact. This study advances our understanding of the disparities in carbon sink capacities between various irrigated and rainfed agroecosystem types on a global scale, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms that drive these differences.

AB  - Against the backdrop of global climate change and rapid urbanization, understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics and driving mechanisms of vegetation net primary productivity (NPP) is critical for ensuring regional ecological security and achieving carbon neutrality goals. This study focuses on the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration (YRDUA) and integrates multi-source remote sensing data with socioeconomic statistics. By combining interpretable machine learning (XGBoost-SHAP) with multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR), and incorporating Theil-Sen trend analysis and Mann-Kendall significance testing, we systematically analyze the spatiotemporal variations in NPP and its multiscale driving mechanisms from 2001 to 2020. The results reveal the following: (1) Total NPP in the YRDUA shows an increasing trend, with approximately 24.83% of the region experiencing a significant rise and only 2.75% showing a significant decline, indicating continuous improvement in regional ecological conditions. (2) Land use change resulted in a net NPP loss of 2.67 TgC, yet ecological restoration and advances in agricultural technology effectively mitigated negative impacts and became the main contributors to NPP growth. (3) The results from XGBoost and MGWR are complementary, highlighting the scale-dependent effects of driving factors-at the regional scale, natural factors such as elevation (DEM), precipitation (PRE), and vegetation cover (VFC) have positive impacts on NPP, while the human footprint (HF) generally exerts a negative effect. However, in certain areas, a dose-response effect is observed, in which moderate human intervention can enhance ecological functions. (4) The spatial heterogeneity of NPP is mainly driven by nonlinear interactions between natural and anthropogenic factors. Notably, the interaction between DEM and climatic variables exhibits threshold responses and a "spatial gradient-factor interaction" mechanism, where the same driver may have opposite effects under different geomorphic conditions. Therefore, a well-balanced combination of land use transformation and ecological conservation policies is crucial for enhancing regional ecological functions and NPP. These findings provide scientific support for ecological management and the formulation of sustainable development strategies in urban agglomerations.

AB  - Impact echo (IE) is one of the most frequently used nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques for detecting subsurface defects such as delamination, honeycombing, and voids in concrete structures. In the conventional analysis of IE data, the time-domain signal is transformed into the frequency domain and the frequency content is used to estimate the presence and nature of the defect. Machine learning (ML) has been recently applied to the IE signal classification problem. However, because of the scarcity of labeled IE datasets, most existing work relies on relatively small training and test datasets without addressing the generalizability and transferability of the developed models. In this paper, we compare two approaches for automatic classification of IE signals: clustering based on expert-crafted features and deep learning (DL) from automatically extracted features. Next, we use the knowledge gained from a DL model trained on concrete specimens with available ground truth to make predictions about defects in a different specimen with completely different construction and characteristics (transfer learning). Finally, we examine our DL model to gain insights into the model working (explainability) and highlight the attributions that are significant in classifying a particular IE signal. Our findings demonstrate the utility of ML and DL for IE signal classification, but also highlight the need for high-quality labeled datasets for advancing ML and DL in NDE data analysis.

AB  - 3D printing technology is growing swiftly in the construction sector due to its numerous benefits, such as intricate designs, quicker construction, waste reduction, environmental friendliness, cost savings, and enhanced safety. Nevertheless, optimizing the concrete mix for 3D printing is a challenging task due to the numerous factors involved, requiring extensive experimentation. Therefore, this study used three machine learning techniques, including Gene Expression Programming (GEP), Multi-Expression Programming (MEP), and Decision Tree (DT), to forecast the compressive strength of 3D printed fiber-reinforced concrete (3DP-FRC). The dataset comprises 299 data points with sixteen variables gathered from experimental research studies. For training the model, 70 % of the dataset was used, while the remaining 30 % was reserved for model testing. Several statistical metrics were utilized to evaluate the accuracy and applicability of the models. In addition, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), partial dependence plots, and individual conditional expectations approach were employed for the interpretability of the models. The proposed GEP, MEP, and DT models indicated enhanced efficacy, exhibiting correlation coefficient (R) scores of 0.996, 0.987, and 0.990, with mean absolute errors (MAE) of 1.029, 4.832, and 2.513, respectively. Overall, the established GEP model demonstrated exceptional performance compared to MEP and DT, showcasing high prediction precision in assessing the strength of 3DP-FRC. Moreover, a simple empirical formulation has been devised using GEP to predict the compressive strength, offering a simplified and efficient approach for predicting 3DPFRC strength. The SHAP approach identified water, silica fume, fiber diameter, curing age, and loading directions as leading controlling parameters in predicting strength of 3DP-FRC. In summary, the proposed models can potentially minimize both the computational workload and the need for experimental trials in formulating the mixed design of 3D-printed concrete.

AB  - Available water in arid watersheds is scarce and is projected to decline in the future. Therefore, optimizing water use in all sectors, especially the agricultural sector with the highest consumptive use, is critical. One common option for optimizing water use is improving irrigation system efficiency. In this on-farm study, three irrigation technologies for center pivots at different irrigation levels were investigated over space and time. Satellite imagery was used to examine the performance of each treatment at a field scale for different crops during 2016-2020. Relative yield change among various crops was calculated to compare treatments spatially and temporally. Finally, relative yield changes were simulated using the most accurate machine learning models for each irrigation technology. The sensitivity of feature importance was evaluated using sensitivity analysis and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), an interpretable machine learning method based on game theory. The results showed that the performance of irrigation systems was influenced by climate conditions such as temperature and precipitation, as well as field features. For example, in drought years, soil electrical conductivity (EC) had the highest influence for some irrigation technologies, while in years with more normal precipitation, elevation had the greatest impact. The method proposed in this paper can be applied in other fields to evaluate irrigation technologies and support better decision-making aimed at enhancing agricultural productivity.

AB  - The ability to monitor mental effort during a task using a wearable sensor may improve productivity for both work and study. The use of the electrodermal activity (EDA) signal for tracking mental effort is an emerging area of research. Through analysis of over 92 h of data collected with the Empatica E4 on a single participant across 91 different activities, we report on the efficacy of using EDA features getting at signal intensity, signal dispersion, and peak intensity for prediction of the participant's self-reported mental effort. We implemented the logistic regression algorithm as an interpretable machine learning approach and found that features related to signal intensity and peak intensity were most useful for the prediction of whether the participant was in a self-reported high mental effort state; increased signal and peak intensity were indicative of high mental effort. When cross-validated by activity moderate predictive efficacy was achieved (AUC = 0.63, F1 = 0.63, precision = 0.64, recall = 0.63) which was significantly stronger than using the model bias alone. Predicting mental effort using physiological data is a complex problem, and our findings add to research from other contexts showing that EDA may be a promising physiological indicator to use for sensor-based self-monitoring of mental effort throughout the day. Integration of other physiological features related to heart rate, respiration, and circulation may be necessary to obtain more accurate predictions.

AB  - Disruption management during the airline scheduling process can be compartmentalized into proactive and reactive processes depending upon the time of schedule execution. The state of the art for decision-making in airline disruption management involves a heuristic human-centric approach that does not categorically study uncertainty in proactive and reactive processes for managing airline schedule disruptions. Hence, this paper introduces an uncertainty transfer function model (UTFM) framework that characterizes uncertainty for proactive airline disruption management before schedule execution, reactive airline disruption management during schedule execution, and proactive airline disruption management after schedule execution to enable the construction of quantitative tools that can allow an intelligent agent to rationalize complex interactions and procedures for robust airline disruption management. Specifically, we use historical scheduling and operations data from a major U.S. airline to facilitate the development and assessment of the UTFM, defined by hidden Markov models (a special class of probabilistic graphical models) that can efficiently perform pattern learning and inference on portions of large data sets.We employ the UTFM to assess two independent and separately disrupted flight legs from the airline route network. Assessment of a flight leg from Dallas to Houston, disrupted by air traffic control hold for bad weather at Dallas, revealed that proactive disruption management for turnaround in Dallas before schedule execution is impractical because of zero transition probability between turnaround and taxi-out. Assessment of another flight leg from Chicago to Boston, disrupted by air traffic control hold for bad weather at Boston, showed that proactive disruption management before schedule execution is possible because of non-zero state transition probabilities at all phases of flight operation.

AB  - During the initial stages of engineering projects management, the accurate estimation of equipment costs plays a crucial role in determining project approval decisions. However, there is a significant research gap regarding the estimation of investment costs for water reuse equipment. Additionally, cost predictions for such construction projects often suffer from limitations, including low accuracy, limited generalizability, and inefficiency. Advanced machine learning (ML) methods, renowned for their ability to model complex decision-making processes, offer powerful solutions. In this study, four traditional models and four ensemble models were employed to predict the cost of water reuse equipment. The results demonstrated that the ensemble models exhibited significantly superior predictive performance to that of traditional models with the three boosting ensemble models achieving the best performance (traditional models: training R-2 = 29.77 %-94.85 %, testing R-2 = 30.62 %-71.72 %; boosting ensemble models: training R-2 = 97.42 %, testing R-2 = 82.16 %-93.79 %). Furthermore, this study simplified the features of predictive models and identified the key variables that influence the cost of water reuse equipment using Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) method. The retrained ensemble models re-constructed based on the selected variables achieved significant predictive performance, with the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) outperforming the other models (training set R-2 = 97.37 %, testing set R-2 = 93.86 %). The water quantity, inflow conductivity, outflow conductivity, and recovery rate emerged as critical factors affecting the cost of water reuse equipment. Overall, the methods proposed in this study can enhance the versatility of cost prediction processes in environmental engineering scenarios, particularly those concerning the construction costs of water treatment equipment.

AB  - The combination of extreme rainfall and rapid urbanisation significantly escalates flood risks in major cities, underscoring the importance of accurately identifying causative factors and formulating differentiated management strategies to enhance urban resilience. This study focuses on the central urban areas of Wuhan, Changsha, and Zhengzhou, identifying flood locations outside the core area by comparing remote sensing images from multiple time periods. Use the BERT-BiLSTM-CRF model to extract flood information from social media data, enabling the rapid and accurate capture of urban flood location information within the core area. A multiyear, high-timeliness flooding disaster map identified 1008 flooding points in Changsha, 960 in Wuhan, and 675 in Zhengzhou. Interpretable machine learning methods (XGboots + SHAP) were utilised to analyse floodinducing factors, revealing that the three cities share six primary factors, including topography, vegetation index (NDVI), and impervious surface, though their degrees of influence vary significantly. Topography predominantly affects Changsha, while Wuhan experiences significant impacts from topography, NDVI, and impervious surfaces. In Zhengzhou, NDVI and construction intensity emerge as the dominant factors. Additionally, the K-means dimension reduction clustering method provides a comprehensive analysis of the characteristics of flood-related disaster factors and their contributions. This enables the accurate identification of the causes of disasters in urban areas and their varying degrees of impact. Results highlighted the critical role of topography in flood occurrences, NDVI's mitigation potential within built-up areas, and the relatively limited flooding influence of certain anthropogenic construction activities. These findings recommend that urban flood management strategies account for spatial heterogeneity.

AB  - The empirical success of the Artificial Intelligence (AI), has enhanced importance of the transparency in black box Machine Learning (ML) models. This study pioneers in developing an explainable and interpretable Deep Neural Network (DNN) model for a Guideless Irregular Dew Point Cooler (GIDPC). The game theory based SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method is used to interpret contribution of the operating conditions on performance parameters. Furthermore, in a response to the endeavours in developing more efficient meta-heuristic optimisation algorithms for the energy systems, two Evolutionary Optimisation (EO) algorithms including a novel bio-inspired algorithm i.e., Slime Mould Algorithm (SMA), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), are employed to simultaneously maximise the cooling efficiency and minimise the construction cost of the GIDPC. Additionally, performance of the optimised GIDPCs are compared in both statistical and deterministic way. The comparisons are carried out in diverse climates in 2020 and 2050 in which the hourly future weather data are projected using a high-emission scenario defined by Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC). The results revealed that the hourly COP of the optimised systems outperform the base design. Although power consumption of all systems increases from 2020 to 2050, owing to more operating hours as a result of global warming, but power savings of up to 72%, 69.49%, 63.24%, and 69.21% in hot summer continental, Arid, tropical rainforest and Mediterranean hot summer climates respectively, can be achieved when the systems run optimally.

AB  - In the context of globalization in the mining industry, assessing the production feasibility of mining projects by smart technology is crucial for the improvement of mining development efficiency. However, evaluating the feasibility of such projects faces significant challenges due to incomplete data and complex variables. In recent years, the development of big data technology has offered new possibilities for rapidly evaluating mining projects. This study conducts an intelligent evaluation of gold mines based on global mineral resources data to estimate whether a gold mine project can be put into production. A technical workflow is constructed, including data filling, evaluation model construction, and production feasibility evaluation. Based on the workflow, the missing data is filled in by the Miceforest imputation algorithm first. The evaluation model is established based on the Random Forest model to quantitatively predict the feasibility of the mining project being put into production, and important features of the model are extracted using Shapley Additive explanation(SHAP). This workflow may enhance the efficiency and accuracy of quantitative production feasibility evaluation for mining projects, with an accuracy rate increased from 93.80% to 95.99%. Results suggest that the features of estimated mine life and gold ore grade have the most significant impact on production feasibility.

AB  - Interpretability of machine learning (ML) models represents the extent to which a model's decision-making process can be understood by model developers and/or end users. Transcriptomics-based cancer prognosis models, for example, while achieving good accuracy, are usually hard to interpret, due to the high-dimensional feature space and the complexity of models. As interpretability is critical for the transparency and fairness of ML models, several algorithms have been proposed to improve the interpretability of arbitrary classifiers. However, evaluation of these algorithms often requires substantial domain knowledge. Here, we propose a breast cancer metastasis prediction model using a very small number of biologically interpretable features, and a simple yet novel model interpretation approach that can provide personalized interpretations. In addition, we contributed, to the best of our knowledge, the first method to quantitatively compare different interpretation algorithms. Experimental results show that our model not only achieved competitive prediction accuracy, but also higher inter-classifier interpretation consistency than state-of-the-art interpretation methods. Importantly, our interpretation results can improve the generalizability of the prediction models. Overall, this work provides several novel ideas to construct and evaluate interpretable ML models that can be valuable to both the cancer machine learning community and related application domains.

AB  - Crystal graph convolutional neural networks (CGCNNs) have revolutionized materials research by eliminating the need for manual feature engineering. However, their lack of interpretability and sensitivity to structural distortions hinders their application in substitution engineering. Therefore, we propose an innovative adversarial example method for guiding feature construction and enhancing the interpretability of CGCNNs. In this study, our focus lies on identifying CsSnBr3-xIx configurations with high-energy conversion efficiency. Initially, we train a CGCNN classifier as a benchmark. Subsequently, we perturb input data to generate a low-performance classifier and identify adversarial examples based on incorrect predictions. Upon comparing these examples with normal examples, we observe substantial structural distortions in adversarial cases, serving as inspiration for the creation of disorder-related features. Consequently, an interpretable model is developed, which surpasses CGCNNs with atomic position perturbations and a gradient-boosting classifier using general features. Notably, the previously overlooked feature "number of unequal atoms" plays an important role in offering crucial insights. Further analysis reveals that configurations with pronounced disorder can exhibit increased power density, thereby enhancing the energy conversion efficiency. Our work not only elucidates the impact of atom substitution on energy conversion efficiency but also provides a roadmap for constructing interpretable machine learning models.

AB  - Construction of large underground infrastructure facilities routinely leads to leakage of groundwater and reduction of pore water pressures, causing time-dependent deformation of overburden soft soil. Coupled hydrogeomechanical numerical models can provide estimates of subsidence, caused by the complex time-dependent processes of creep and consolidation, thereby increasing our understanding of when and where deformations will arise and at what magnitude. However, such hydro-mechanical models are computationally expensive and generally not feasible at larger scales, where decisions are made on design and mitigation. Therefore, a computationally efficient Machine Learning-based metamodel is implemented, which emulates 2D finite element scenario-based simulations of ground deformations with the advanced Creep-SCLAY-1S-model. The metamodel employs decision tree-based ensemble learners random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGB), with spatially explicit hydrostratigraphic data as features. In a case study in Central Gothenburg, Sweden, the metamodel shows high predictive skill (Pearson's r of 0.9-0.98) on 25% of unseen data and good agreement with the numerical model on unseen cross-sections. Through interpretable Machine Learning, Shapley analysis provides insights into the workings of the metamodel, which alignes with process understanding. The approach provides a novel tool for efficient, scenario-based decision support on large scales based on an advanced soil model emulated by a physically plausible metamodel.

AB  - The construction industry is rapidly adopting Industry 4.0 technologies, creating new opportunities to address persistent environmental and operational challenges. This review focuses on how Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) are being leveraged to tackle these issues. It specifically explores AI's role in predicting air pollution, improving material quality, monitoring worker health and safety, and enhancing Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) for construction. This study evaluates various AI and ML models, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines SVMs, as well as optimization techniques like whale and moth flame optimization. These tools are assessed for their ability to predict air pollutant levels, improve concrete quality, and monitor worker safety in real time. Research papers were also reviewed to understand AI's application in predicting the compressive strength of materials like cement mortar, fly ash, and stabilized clay soil. The performance of these models is measured using metrics such as coefficient of determination (R2), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Furthermore, AI has shown promise in predicting and reducing emissions of air pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, SO2, and O3. In addition, it improves construction material quality and ensures worker safety by monitoring health indicators like standing postures, electrocardiogram, and galvanic skin response. It is also concluded that AI technologies, including Explainable AI and Petri Nets, are also making advancements in CPS for the construction industry. The models' performance metrics indicate they are well-suited for real-time construction operations. The study highlights the adaptability and effectiveness of these technologies in meeting current and future construction needs. However, gaps remain in certain areas of research, such as broader AI integration across diverse construction environments and the need for further validation of models in real-world applications. Finally, this research underscores the potential of AI and ML to revolutionize the construction industry by promoting sustainable practices, improving operational efficiency, and addressing safety concerns. It also provides a roadmap for future research, offering valuable insights for industry stakeholders interested in adopting AI technologies.

AB  - Manufacturing quality control (QC) in plastic injection moulding is of the upmost importance since almost one third of plastic products are manufactured via the injection moulding process. Moreover, smart manufacturing technologies are enabling the generation of huge amounts of data in production lines. This data can be used for predicting the quality of manufactured plastic products using machine learning methods, allowing companies to save costs and improve their production efficiency. However, high-performance machine learning models are usually too complicated to be understood by human intuition. Therefore, we have introduced a rule-based explanations (RBE) framework that combines several machine learning interpretation methods to help to understand the decision mechanisms of accurate and complex predictive models - specifically tree ensemble models. These generated rules can be used to visually and easily understand the main factors that affect the quality in the manufacturing process. To demonstrate the applicability of RBE, we present two experiments with real industrial data gathered from a plastic injection moulding machine in a Singapore model factory. The collected datasets contain condition data for several manufacturing processes as well as the QC results for sink mark defects in the production of small plastic products. The experiments revealed that it is possible to extract meaningful explanations in the form of simple decision rules that are enhanced with partial dependence plots and feature importance rankings for a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms and data relationships of accurate tree ensembles.

AB  - This study proposes a novel deep learning-based approach for financial risk early warning in listed companies through a hierarchical attention network that integrates multi-dimensional data sources. Traditional financial risk prediction models often struggle with complex non-linear relationships and fail to effectively combine diverse information types. We develop a comprehensive framework that simultaneously processes financial statements, market trading data, and textual information through specialized neural network components. The model employs a two-level attention mechanism that dynamically weights both individual features and information sources, enabling interpretable risk assessment. Using data from 2,876 Chinese A-share listed companies from 2015 to 2024, our empirical analysis demonstrates that the proposed model achieves superior predictive performance (AUC-ROC: 0.873) compared to traditional statistical approaches (0.742-0.768) and conventional machine learning methods (0.812-0.845). The model provides early warning signals approximately 4.2 months before actual distress events, significantly outperforming benchmark models (2.3-3.7 months). Notably, the model maintains robust performance during market stress periods (accuracy: 0.798) compared to traditional models (accuracy: 0.678). The attention mechanism reveals that the relative importance of different risk indicators varies systematically with market conditions, with financial ratios dominating during stable periods (weight: 0.435) and market signals becoming more crucial during crises (weight: 0.412). These findings contribute to both the theoretical understanding of financial risk dynamics and practical risk management applications, while demonstrating the effectiveness of interpretable deep learning approaches in financial analysis.

AB  - Predicting the onset of flash droughts remains a formidable challenge for current drought early warning systems. However, understanding the timing and mechanisms of flash drought recovery is equally critical for effective flash drought risk management. Despite this, limited research has focused on the recovery phase across different stages of the flash drought full life cycle. This study integrates multi-source data to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics, key drivers, and underlying mechanisms of flash drought recovery processes across nine agroclimatic regions in China from 1980 to 2020. Integrating Geodetector and interpretable machine learning (XGBoost-SHAP), we quantified the relative contributions of precipitation patterns and land surface characteristics to flash drought recovery rates (FDRR). Additionally, a composite analysis was conducted to clarify the role of extreme precipitation events and assess the risk of cascading dry-to-wet transitions associated with flash drought covery. Results indicate that after the year 2000, flash drought events with both high onset and high recovery rates have significantly increased in China's monsoon region. Extreme precipitation events drive flash drought recovery in only 0-20 % of cases across most regions, except in the central and western Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, where the probability reaches 40-60 %, highlighting a high-risk zone for cascading dry-to-wet transitions. Encouragingly, XGBoost-based simulations of FDRR in this region achieved high accuracy (R2 = 0.912). SHAPbased interpretation and interaction detection confirmed that precipitation characteristics and land surface conditions are the primary determinants of FDRR. Key factors include cumulative precipitation, maximum precipitation, drought severity, terrain slope, and soil clay content. In China's flash drought hotspot, the Middle Lower Yangtze Plain, the primary moisture source during flash drought recovery predominantly stems from large-scale circulation systems rather than local evapotranspiration or moisture recycling. Our findings highlight the feasibility of developing flash drought recovery forecasting models, which could improve risk management strategies for meteorological and agricultural agencies. If predicting flash drought onset remains challenging, accurately forecasting recovery may be crucial in mitigating flash drought risks.

AB  - The sudden outbreak and uncontrolled spread of COVID-19 disease is one of the most important global problems today. In a short period of time, it has led to the development of many deep neural network models for COVID-19 detection with modules for explainability. In this work, we carry out a systematic analysis of various aspects of proposed models. Our analysis revealed numerous mistakes made at different stages of data acquisition, model development, and explanation construction. In this work, we overview the approaches proposed in the surveyed Machine Learning articles and indicate typical errors emerging from the lack of deep understanding of the radiography domain. We present the perspective of both: experts in the field -radiologists and deep learning engineers dealing with model explanations. The final result is a proposed checklist with the minimum conditions to be met by a reliable COVID-19 diagnostic model.

AB  - Background/aim: Accurate diagnosis of early-onset psychotic disorders is crucial to improve clinical outcomes. This study aimed to differentiate patients with early-onset schizophrenia (EOS) from early-onset bipolar disorder (EBD) with machine learning (ML) algorithms using white matter tracts (WMT).Method: Diffusion tensor imaging was obtained from adolescents with either EOS (n = 43) or EBD (n = 32). Global probabilistic tractography using an automated tract-based TRACULA software was performed to analyze the fractional anisotropy (FA) of forty-two WMT. The nested cross-validation was performed in feature selection and model construction. EXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) was applied to select the features that can give the best performance in the ML model. The interpretability of the model was explored with the SHApley Additive exPlanations (SHAP).Findings: The XGBoost algorithm identified nine out of the 42 major WMTs with significant predictive power. Among ML models, Support Vector Machine-Linear showed the best performance. Higher SHAP values of left acoustic radiation, bilateral anterior thalamic radiation, and the corpus callosum were associated with a higher likelihood of EOS.Conclusions: Our findings suggested that ML models based on the FA values of major WMT reconstructed by global probabilistic tractography can unveil hidden microstructural aberrations to distinguish EOS from EBD.

AB  - Valorizing industrial byproducts in construction applications is a promising approach for enhancing sustain- ability. Global annual production of ceramic waste including broken tiles is a considerable challenge. Yet, such ceramic tile waste has great potential in sustainable concrete production, for instance as fine and coarse aggregate. Effective use of ceramic tile waste in concrete requires accurate prediction of recycled tile concrete mechanical strength. This study deploys state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for predicting the compressive and tensile strength of ceramic tile-based concrete. The authors recently performed an extensive experimental program on the mechanical characterization of ceramic tile-based concrete, allowing to build a comprehensive database of 252 data points with varying key mixture proportions. The latter was used to develop a data-driven machine learning (ML) modeling framework for predicting the mechanical properties of the concrete using XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, and Extra Trees regressors. The independent variables of the dataset affecting mechanical strength included the cast density, percentage of ceramic tiles used as coarse and fine aggregate, water-to-cement ratio, water absorption capacity, and hydration age. The influence of different input features on the model predictions was visualized using SHAP feature importance plots. Ultimately, a machine learning-based and user-friendly graphical interface was created and made available through the Streamlit platform to aid in the design of ceramic tile-based sustainable concrete.

AB  - The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into acupuncture research is accelerating the transformation of this traditional, experience-based practice into a data-driven, precision discipline. This review synthesizes recent advances in AI-enabled outcome prediction techniques, encompassing deep learning, meta-analytic modeling, natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and neuroimaging-based analysis. For instance, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully applied to classify tongue images and detect ZHENG patterns, while transformer-based NLP models enable automated extraction of clinical knowledge from classical texts. These technologies improve diagnostic objectivity, standardize treatment planning, and facilitate individualized care by enabling longitudinal efficacy modeling and real-time monitoring. Despite their potential, current implementations are constrained by limited and heterogeneous datasets, annotation variability, and gaps in clinical validation. We analyze key methodological innovations and challenges, and recommend future directions including the construction of federated multimodal data platforms, development of explainable AI frameworks, and promotion of open science practices. This convergence of AI and acupuncture presents a unique opportunity to enhance scientific rigor, clinical utility, and global integration of acupuncture within the paradigm of precision integrative medicine.

AB  - Surface ozone (O-3) is a critical ambient pollutant that poses significant risks to both human health and ecosystems. However, there is a scarcity of high-spatial-resolution hourly surface O-3 data, which is crucial for understanding its diurnal variations. In this study, we employed a best-performing spatiotemporal artificial intelligence (AI) model to estimate 24-hourly 1-km-resolution surface O-3 concentrations across China, incorporating key photochemical processes responsible for O-3 formation. Our model effectively captured diurnal O-3 patterns, achieving average sample-based cross-validated coefficients of determination (root-mean-square errors) of 0.89 (16.35 mu g/m(3)) for the full day (00:00-23:00 LT), 0.92 (15.72 mu g/m(3)) during daytime (08:00-20:00 LT), and 0.82 (16.97 mu g/m(3)) at nighttime (20:00-08:00 LT). Typically, surface O-3 levels increase after sunrise, peak around 15:00 LT, and decrease overnight, with a diurnal variation magnitude of 62 % relative to the mean level. During the daytime, we found that solar radiation (in the ultraviolet and shortwave spectra) and surface temperature explained over 42 % of the diurnal variation, while nighttime O-3 levels were mainly influenced by tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (16 %), temperature (13 %), and relative humidity (12 %). In 2019, approximately 61 %, 98 %, and 100 % of populated areas in China experienced O-3 exposure risks for at least one day, with maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) O-3 levels exceeding 160, 120, and 100 mu g/m(3), respectively. Additionally, around 70 %, 82 %, and 100 % of vegetated areas exceeded the three minimum critical thresholds for cumulative hourly O-3 exposure, as indicated by the SUM06, W126, and AOT40 indices, respectively. Notably, gross primary productivity (GPP) was the most sensitive indicator of O-3 pollution across various vegetation types, showing a strong negative correlation with AOT0 (R = -0.43 to -0.59, p < 0.001).

AB  - This study explores the influence of high-volume eco-binders, including ground granulated blast furnace slag (BFS) and fly ash (FLA), on the performance of high-performance concrete (HPC) through physical-data dual drive. Initially, the basic properties of the mixtures are assessed via compressive strength and slump tests. Nanoindentation experiments are conducted to examine the interfacial transition zone (ITZ) properties. The findings indicate that mixtures incorporating BFS or FLA demonstrate optimal improvements in compressive strength, flowability, and ITZ performance at substitution rates between 10 % and 30 % under the same curing conditions. However, substitution rates of 50 % or higher result in reduced performance. Machine learning techniques play a central role in this research because they can accurately predict specific properties. Data distribution analysis is utilized to guide the development of ensemble learning models. The integration of SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) enhances model interpretability. XGBoost outperforms traditional models, including LR, BP, KNN, SVR, and ANN. Specifically, XGBoost achieves an RMSE of 4.557, MAE of 2.687, MAPE of 8.647 %, and R2 of 0.929 for compressive strength, and an RMSE of 3.495, MAE of 1.405, MAPE of 0.938 %, and R2 of 0.968 for flowability. SHAP analysis identifies Age and Admixtures as the most significant factors influencing both compressive strength and flowability in HPC. This study provides valuable insights into improving the performance of eco-binder high-performance concrete, demonstrating the potential of machine learning in predicting and optimizing concrete performance and offering a data-driven approach to support the sustainable development of eco-friendly construction materials.

AB  - Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) pose considerable challenges in the realm of cybersecurity, characterized by their evolving tactics and complex evasion techniques. These characteristics often outsmart traditional security measures and necessitate the development of more sophisticated detection methods. This study introduces Feature Evolution using Genetic Programming (FEGP), a novel method that leverages multi-tree Genetic Programming (GP) to construct and enhance features for APT detection. While GP has been widely utilized for tackling various problems indifferent domains, our study focuses on the adaptation of GP to the multifaceted landscape of APT detection. The proposed method automatically constructs discriminative features by combining the original features using mathematical operators. By leveraging GP, the system adapts to the evolving tactics employed by APTs, enhancing the identification of APT activities with greater accuracy and reliability. To assess the efficacy of the proposed method, comprehensive experiments were conducted on widely used and publicly accessible APT datasets. Using the combination of constructed and original features on the DAPT-2020 dataset, FEGP achieved a balanced accuracy of 79.28%, surpassing the best comparative methods by an average of 2.12% in detecting APT stages. Additionally, utilizing only constructed features on the Unraveled dataset, FEGP achieved a balanced accuracy of 83.14%, demonstrating a 3.73% improvement over the best comparative method. The findings presented in this paper underscore the importance of GP-based feature construction for APT detection, providing a pathway toward improved accuracy and efficiency in identifying APT activities. The comparative analysis of the proposed method against existing feature construction methods demonstrates FEGP's effectiveness as a state-of-the-art method for multi-class APT classification. In addition to the performance evaluation, further analysis was conducted, encompassing feature importance analysis, and a detailed time analysis.

AB  - Geopolymer concrete is a sustainable and eco-friendly substitute for traditional OPC (Ordinary Portland Cement) based concrete, as it reduces greenhouse gas emissions. With various supplementary cementitious materials, the compressive strength of geopolymer concrete should be accurately predicted. Recent studies have applied deep learning techniques to predict the compressive strength of geopolymer concrete yet its hidden decision-making criteria diminish the end-users' trust in predictions. To bridge this gap, the authors first developed three deep learning models: an artificial neural network (ANN), a deep neural network (DNN), and a 1D convolution neural network (CNN) to predict the compressive strength of slag ash-based geopolymer concrete. The performance indices for accuracy revealed that the DNN model outperforms the other two models. Subsequently, Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) were used to explain the best-performed deep learning model, DNN, and its compressive strength predictions. SHAP exhibited how the importance of each feature and its relationship contributes to the compressive strength prediction of the DNN model. Finally, the authors developed a novel DNN-based open-source software interface to predict the mix design proportions for a given target compressive strength (using inverse modeling technique) for slag ash-based geopolymer concrete. Additionally, the software calculates the Global Warming Potential (kg CO2 equivalent) for each mix design to select the mix designs with low greenhouse emissions.

AB  - Accurate prediction of surface settlement (SS) induced by deep foundation pit (DFP) excavation is challenging considering the complicated soil distributions and uncertain construction situations. Therefore, a Recurrent Gated Unit (GRU) neural network model incorporated with Variation Mode Decomposition (VMD) was developed for SS prediction. By data denoising with VMD and hyperparameter tuning using Bayesian Optimization (BO), the proposed GRU model achieved dynamic and accurate prediction of SS caused by DFP excavation. Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis was then performed to enhance the interpretability of the GRU model. The presented GRU model was validated with a case study of Wuhan Metro Line 12 Shiqiao Station. The results indicate that: (1) The GRU models with VMD data denoising technique achieved accurate prediction with the average RMSE of 0.0244, MAE of 0.0189, MAPE of 0.0017, R-2 of 0.9894, and VAF of 99.1206. (2) The GRU model outperformed the other five state-of-the-art models in predictive performance with robustness improvement of 13.5%, 12.0%, 50.0%, 29.2%, and 27.3%, separately, compared to the other five models. (3) The historical values of the SS make the most significant contributions to the outcomes of the GRU models. In short, this study enhances the accurate and dynamic prediction of SS caused by DFP excavation, contributing to the safe execution of DFP projects.

AB  - Accurate wind speed prediction plays an important role in developing effective coastal management strategies and risk assessments, especially in coastal region managements to reduce erosion damage. In offshore wind energy, precise forecasts optimize wind farm layout and operations, maximizing energy yield and minimizing downtime. Additionally, accurate wind speed forecasts significantly improve maritime transportation safety by predicting hazardous conditions. Understanding wind patterns is also important for coastal ecosystem management and safer navigation activities. However, accurate wind speed prediction in dynamic coastal environments remains challenging due to (1) limited applications of robust machine learning (ML) models tailored to coastal meteorological complexity, (2) insufficient integration of interpretable feature analysis with predictive modeling for actionable insights, and (3) gaps in understanding how seasonal and diurnal wind patterns influence model performance in understudied regions like tropical Queensland. This study focuses on Abbot Point, Queensland, Australia, using meteorological data collected hourly from January 1 to December 31, 2023 (Latitude: -19.9496; Longitude: 148.0482). It evaluates three machine ML models-Linear Regression (LR), Decision Tree Regressor (DT), and Random Forest (RF)-to identify the most reliable approach for wind speed forecasting. The dataset includes wind direction, air temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, and barometric pressure as feature variables, with wind speed as the target variable. Novel integration of SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis and seasonal decomposition addresses interpretability gaps, while rigorous validation across training (70%), testing (15%), and validation (15%) datasets ensures model robustness. The RF model consistently outperformed others across training, validation, and test datasets, achieving the lowest mean square error (MSE: Train 0.183, Validation 0.875, Test 0.803), highest R2 (Train 0.966, Validation 0.831, Test 0.844), and superior Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE: Train 0.96, Validation 0.83, Test 0.84). These results reflect the model's robust ability to capture complex relationships in the data. In contrast, LR and DT exhibited moderate accuracy, with higher MSE and lower NSE values, struggling particularly with consistency and extreme values. Complementary analyses, including wind rose plots and time series of wind speed, relative humidity, and barometric pressure, revealed high-risk periods characterized by strong winds (> 10 m/s), high humidity (> 90%), and low barometric pressure (< 1000 hPa). Seasonal analysis revealed spring/summer peaks in hazardous winds (> 10 m/s), with diurnal cycles (24-h periodicity) significantly influencing prediction accuracy-a pattern underemphasized in prior coastal ML studies. This study bridges critical gaps by demonstrating how interpretable ML enhances coastal wind prediction through: a) quantitative validation of RFR's superiority over traditional models in handling coastal meteorological variability, b) SHAP-driven identification of dominant predictors (wind direction, pressure) for targeted monitoring, c) Seasonal-temporal analysis framework for site-specific risk mitigation strategies. These findings confirm the interactions between meteorological variables that intensify storm risks and coastal hazards.
   Key insights include the dominant influence of southeast and south-southwest winds (100 degrees-200 degrees) and the critical role of barometric pressure in driving extreme wind events. Also, findings enable improved storm surge modeling and early warning systems by providing 6-h wind forecasts with 84% accuracy, directly informing coastal defense alignment with dominant wind-driven erosion patterns. This approach addresses the critical need for ML applications that combine predictive power with operational interpretability in coastal management contexts. The integration of ML models with detailed meteorological patterns supports the identification of high-risk periods, enabling targeted interventions such as strengthening coastal defenses and issuing early warnings. This study underscores the value of ML techniques, particularly RF, in enhancing predictive frameworks for coastal risk management and promoting sustainable, resilient coastal environments.

AB  - The increasing risk of floods across the globe needs focused attention because of the extensive damage to human lives and economy. A comprehensive understanding of its causative factors is of vital importance. Yet catchment characterization studies are generally limited to case studies or regional domains. A comprehensive global characterization is currently unavailable, which requires collecting and collating a large number of datasets over vast areas. This study embraces large-sample data-driven science as a new paradigm to characterize streamflow extremes by utilizing global datasets of physiographic explanatory variables that could explain various facets of extreme streamflows. Along with the spatial and temporal variations of high streamflow extremes, their corre-lation with various catchment characteristics such as geomorphology, meteorology, climatology, landcover, li-thology, etc. were examined. The multidimensional relationships between the streamflow extremes and catchment characteristics were modeled using a Random Forest approach and combined with an interpretable machine learning framework to identify the most dominant factors in varying climate classes. Interpretation with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) reveals that meteorological variables are the most influential variables across the climatic classes. However, the variables and their influences change among different climatic classes. Moreover, different geomorphological variables come into dominance across climatic classes (such as basin relief in warm temperate and drainage texture in arid climates). Overall, the insights from the study could play a crucial role in predicting the unit peak discharge at ungauged stations from the known catchment characteristics. Moreover, these findings can also play a crucial role in formulating risk management strategy.

AB  - The conical pick is the most essential tool of excavation machinery such as roadheaders, continuous miners, and shearers for breaking rock in mining and civil engineering operations. For rock cuttability, however, the geometry of conical picks and mechanical parameters of rocks are the most important factors. This study aims to construct an optimized data-driven predictive model to establish a quantitative correlation between strength of rock, geometry of tool, and cutting action data with the mean cutting force (CF). For this purpose, 157 datasets of 47 different materials including rocks, ores, coals, and artificial rocks with uniaxial compressive strength (sigma(c)), tensile strength (sigma(t)), cone angle (theta), attack angle (gamma), cutting depth (d), and mean CF (MCF) are accumulated from the literature. Then, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model is constructed by fine-tuning hyperparameters using grid search, random search, genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and differential evolution (DE). Based on performance indices that are calculated for each model, i.e., coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAE) for the best performed model, i.e., DE-XGboost are R-2 = 0.812, RMSE =2256.90N, and MAE =1313.66 N for training stage and R-2 = 0.875, RMSE =2104.86N, and MAE =1140.42 N for testing stage, respectively. The findings also suggest that using a metaheuristic algorithm to fine-tune the hyperparameters of the XGBoost model can increase prediction accuracy. In the last step, three model interpretation methods viz., the permutation-based variable importance, H-statistic-based variable interaction, and accumulated local effects are applied to sensitivity analysis of the input parameters to predict MCF, providing key insights to model and researchers. The ALE plot demonstrated a complex non-linear relationship between predictors and the response variable. It is revealed that parameters d and theta have the highest and lowest impact on the MCF, respectively. Finally, the successful implementation of this approach provides a solid platform for future studies and can be an alternative to complicated conventional and theoretical methods.

AB  - This retrospective study leverages machine learning to determine the optimal timing for fracture reconstruction surgery in polytrauma patients, focusing on those with concomitant traumatic brain injury. The analysis included 218 patients admitted to Qilu Hospital of Shandong University from July 2011 to April 2024. Demographic data, physiological status, and non-invasive test indicators were collected. Feature selection via the Boruta and LASSO algorithms preceded the construction of predictive models using Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, LightGBM, and XGBoost. The Random Forest model excelled in the training set, with an AUC-ROC of 0.828 and accuracy of 0.745, and sustained high performance in the validation set (AUC-ROC: 0.840; Accuracy: 0.813). The final model was informed by eight critical factors, including the Glasgow Coma Scale score, calcium levels, D-dimer, hemoglobin, platelet count, LDL-cholesterol, prothrombin time-international normalized ratio, and prior surgeries. SHAP and LIME algorithms were utilized for model interpretation, elucidating the importance and predictive thresholds of the variables. The application of machine learning in this study provided precise predictions for optimal surgical conditions and timing in polytrauma patients with traumatic brain injury and fractures. This study's findings provide a foundation for personalized surgical planning, potentially reducing postoperative infections and improving patient prognoses.

AB  - Pesticide residues in fruits and vegetables pose a serious threat to food safety. Traditional detection methods have defects such as complex operation, high cost, and long detection time. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop rapid, non-destructive, and efficient detection technologies and equipment. In recent years, the combination of spectroscopic techniques and imaging technologies with machine learning algorithms has developed rapidly, providing a new attempt to solve this problem. This review focuses on the research progress of the combination of spectroscopic techniques (near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), hyperspectral imaging technology (HSI), surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), and imaging techniques (visible light (VIS) imaging, NIRS imaging, HSI technology, terahertz imaging) with machine learning algorithms in the detection of pesticide residues in fruits and vegetables. It also explores the huge challenges faced by the application of spectroscopic and imaging technologies combined with machine learning algorithms in the intelligent perception of pesticide residues in fruits and vegetables: the performance of machine learning models requires further enhancement, the fusion of imaging and spectral data presents technical difficulties, and the commercialization of hardware devices remains underdeveloped. This review has proposed an innovative method that integrates spectral and image data, enhancing the accuracy of pesticide residue detection through the construction of interpretable machine learning algorithms, and providing support for the intelligent sensing and analysis of agricultural and food products.

AB  - Most failures in steel materials are due to fatigue damage, so it is of great significance to analyze the key features of fatigue strength (FS) in order to improve fatigue performance. This study collected data on the fatigue strength of steel materials and established a predictive model for FS based on machine learning (ML). Three feature-construction strategies were proposed based on the dataset, and compared on four typical ML algorithms. The combination of Strategy III (composition, heat-treatment, and atomic features) and the GBT algorithm showed the best performance. Subsequently, input features were selected step by step using methods such as the analysis of variance (ANOVA), embedded method, recursive method, and exhaustive method. The key features affecting FS were found to be TT, mE, APID, and Mo. Based on these key features and Bayesian optimization, an ML model was established, which showed a good performance. Finally, Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) and symbolic regression (SR) are introduced to improve the interpretability of the prediction model. It had been discovered through SHAP analysis that TT and Mo had the most significant impact on FS. Specifically, it was observed that 160 < TT < 500 and Mo > 0.15 was beneficial for increasing the value of FS. SR was used to establish a significant mathematical relationship between these key features and FS.

AB  - The health and productivity of plants, particularly those in agricultural and horticultural industries, are significantly affected by timely and accurate disease detection. Traditional manual inspection methods are labor-intensive, subjective, and often inaccurate, failing to meet the precision required by modern agricultural practices. This research introduces an innovative deep transfer learning method utilizing an advanced version of the Xception architecture, specifically designed for identifying plant diseases in roses, mangoes, and tomatoes. The proposed model introduces additional convolutional layers following the base Xception architecture, combined with multiple trainable dense layers, incorporating advanced regularization and dropout techniques to optimize feature extraction and classification. This architectural enhancement enables the model to capture complex, subtle patterns within plant leaf images, contributing to more robust disease identification. A comprehensive dataset comprising 5491 images across four distinct disease categories was employed for the training, validation, and testing of the model. The experimental results showcased outstanding performance, achieving 98% accuracy, 99% precision, 98% recall, and a 98% F1-score. The model outperformed traditional techniques as well as other deep learning-based methods. These results emphasize the potential of this advanced deep learning framework as a scalable, efficient, and highly accurate solution for early plant disease detection, providing substantial benefits for plant health management and supporting sustainable agricultural practices.

AB  - Bearings are vital components in machinery, and their malfunction can result in equipment damage and reduced productivity. As a result, considerable research attention has been directed toward the early detection of bearing faults. With recent rapid advancements in machine learning algorithms, there is increasing interest in proactively diagnosing bearing faults by analyzing signals obtained from bearings. Although numerous studies have introduced machine learning methods for bearing fault diagnosis, the high costs associated with sensors and data acquisition devices limit their practical application in industrial environments. Additionally, research aimed at identifying the root causes of faults through diagnostic algorithms has progressed relatively slowly. This study proposes a cost-effective monitoring system to improve economic feasibility. Its primary benefits include significant cost savings compared to traditional high-priced equipment, along with versatility and ease of installation, enabling straightforward attachment and removal. The system collects data by measuring the vibrations of both normal and faulty bearings under various operating conditions on a test bed. Using these data, a deep neural network is trained to enable real-time feature extraction and classification of bearing conditions. Furthermore, an explainable AI technique is applied to extract key feature values identified by the fault classification algorithm, providing a method to support the analysis of fault causes.

AB  - Cement-based grouting material, distinguished by excellent fluidity and high strength, is widely used in the field of construction reinforcement, and anchoring of restraints. Owing to the high-performance requirements and complicated influencing factors of grouting material, the design of the mixing proportion has been challenging. This study proposes a machine learning (ML) based algorithmic framework integrating prediction, interpretation, and automatic hyperparameter tuning to identify the complex potential relationships between the mixing pro-portion parameters on the compressive strength and fluidity of cement-based grouting materials. The 442 compressive strength data and 217 fluidity data derived from both published literatures and laboratory exper-iments were collected to build a dataset for demonstrating the predictive performance of the ML models. The results indicated that the hyperparameter tuning technique via Bayesian Optimisation (BO) can significantly improve the time efficiency compared to grid search, reducing time consumption from 8000 s to 197 s with comparable accuracy. The optimal prediction results were obtained based on the XGBoost model with R2 = 0.93, RMSE = 7.37 for compressive strength, and R2 = 0.92, RMSE = 16.33 for fluidity. The SHapley Additive exPlainations (SHAP) is introduced to interpret the evaluation results and the influence of the various mix factors on grouting material from both global(model) and local(instance) perspectives. The suggested model can be seen as a function of influential input variables that help engineers conduct a rapid assessment and then in turn to optimize the design of the mixture proportion.

AB  - Rolling element bearings are critical components of rotating machinery, with their performance directly influencing the efficiency and reliability of industrial systems. At the same time, bearing faults are a leading cause of machinery failures, often resulting in costly downtime, reduced productivity, and, in extreme cases, catastrophic damage. This study presents a methodology that utilizes Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks-a recent deep learning alternative to Multilayer Perceptrons. The proposed method automatically selects the most relevant features from sensor data and searches for optimal hyper-parameters within a single unified approach. By using shallow network architectures and fewer features, the resulting models are lightweight, easily interpretable, and practical for real-time applications. Validated on two widely recognized datasets for bearing fault diagnosis, the framework achieved perfect F1-Scores for fault detection and high performance in fault and severity classification tasks, including 100% F1-Scores in most cases. Notably, it demonstrated adaptability by handling diverse fault types, such as imbalance and misalignment, within the same dataset. The availability of symbolic representations provided model interpretability, while feature attribution offered insights into the optimal feature types or signals for each studied task. These results highlight the framework's potential for practical applications, such as real-time machinery monitoring, and for scientific research requiring efficient and explainable models.

AB  - This study provides a comprehensive overview of the rapidly evolving environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risk field by integrating a bibliometric analysis with a systematic literature review (SLR). The bibliometric results reveal a sharp rise in scholarly output since 2020, driven by tighter sustainability regulations, growing investor scrutiny, and global disruptions such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Performance analysis highlights that Europe and North America, particularly Italy and the United States, lead in research productivity and citation impact, although collaboration remains fragmented. Science mapping identifies seven dominant thematic clusters, ranging from ESG risk integration in finance, controversies, and governance linkages to emerging data-driven and machine learning methods, which align closely with six core themes synthesized from the SLR. The qualitative synthesis of 26 influential studies confirms that ESG risk is a financially material factor influencing firm performance, audit quality, credit risk, and investment returns, but also exposes persistent challenges such as inconsistent measurement, limited causal testing, and underexplored contexts outside developed markets. The combined insights underline the need for harmonized ESG risk indicators, dynamic causal modeling, explainable AI, and cross-country comparative research. By bridging bibliometric structure and qualitative depth, this study offers an integrated foundation to guide future ESG risk scholarship and support more resilient, sustainable financial decision-making.

AB  - Accurate prediction of water inrush volumes is essential for safeguarding tunnel construction operations. This study proposes a method for predicting tunnel water inrush volumes, leveraging the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model optimized with Bayesian techniques. To maximize the utility of available data, 654 datasets with missing values were imputed and augmented, forming a robust dataset for the training and validation of the Bayesian optimized XGBoost (BO-XGBoost) model. Furthermore, the SHapley Additive explanations (SHAP) method was employed to elucidate the contribution of each input feature to the predictive outcomes. The results indicate that: (1) The constructed BO-XGBoost model exhibited exceptionally high predictive accuracy on the test set, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 7.5603, mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.2940, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 4.51%, and coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9755; (2) Compared to the predictive performance of support vector mechine (SVR), decision tree (DT), and random forest (RF) models, the BO-XGBoost model demonstrates the highest R2 values and the smallest prediction error; (3) The input feature importance yielded by SHAP is groundwater level (h) > water-producing characteristics (W) > tunnel burial depth (H) > rock mass quality index (RQD). The proposed BO-XGBoost model exhibited exceptionally high predictive accuracy on the tunnel water inrush volume prediction dataset, thereby aiding managers in making informed decisions to mitigate water inrush risks and ensuring the safe and efficient advancement of tunnel projects.

AB  - One of the primary objectives of modern concrete advancements is to strike a delicate balance among factors such as improved mechanical performance, appropriate economic viability, and reduced carbon emissions. Given this backdrop, self-compacting concrete incorporating recycled aggregates (referred to herein as RASCC) has gained attention in the quest for sustainable construction materials. Nevertheless, concurrently attaining the above objectives is not an easy feat for this particular type of concrete. In this study, a machine learning model based on the XGBoost algorithm was developed using 368 sample data points to predict the compressive strength of RASCC. To enhance the model's accuracy, the chemical composition of RASCC's binding materials, rather than the quantities of constituent materials, was chosen as part of input parameters, giving rise to the term "chemistry-informed" for this model. The model's interpretability was comprehensively examined using the So library. Then, in conjunction with the explainable machine learning model, the NSGA-II algorithm was leveraged to establish a RASCC auxiliary design system, enabling triple-objective optimization (i.e., strength, cost, and carbon emissions). The findings indicated that the XGBoost-based model achieved superior accuracy in predicting RASCC's strength as compared to an existing neural network-based model. Additionally, using compound contents as inputs imbued the model with chemical significance, thus further enhancing its accuracy and interpretability. In conclusion, this study presents a plausible and beneficial tool for the efficient, cost-effective, and low-carbon design of RASCC.

AB  - Flat slabs, despite their aesthetic qualities and widespread use in construction, are susceptible to brittle shear failure. In addition, although design provisions are available, they are often associated with high bias and variance. This study evaluates the efficiency of machine learning-based approaches in establishing accurate prediction models for the punching shear strength of flat slabs without transverse reinforcement. To this end, 380 experimental results from various literature are assembled in this study. In addition to linear regression, seven machine learning methods as ridge regression, support vector regression, decision tree, K-nearest neighbors, random forest, adaptive boosting, and extreme gradient boosting-are considered in this study to obtain the best prediction model for the punching shear strength of flat slabs. Based on random assignment of the data into training and test sets and a performance evaluation of the test set, the extreme gradient boosting model is shown to have the highest coefficient of determination and lowest mean square error estimate. The superior performance of this machine learning model is further underscored through comparison of its shear strength predictions with those of existing code provisions and empirical models. It is noted that the extreme gradient boosting model has a coefficient of determination of 0.98, and the associated coefficient of variation is 0.09. This study also employs the SHapley Additive explanation method to explain the importance and contribution of the factors that influence the punching shear strength in the extreme gradient boosting model.

AB  - Variability and repeatability challenges in Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) limit its industrial applications. The difficulty of effectively evaluating similar defects with varying severity poses reliability issues for in-situ monitoring based on acoustic monitoring. In the LPBF acoustic monitoring scenario, the original signal amplitude is weak, and the acoustic field coupling information is complex, so it is difficult to directly obtain high- quality and physically reasonable LPBF defect features, which leads to the difficulty of reliably monitoring LPBF defects. This study proposes a novel LPBF pore defect monitoring approach based on acoustic signal physical defect information feature extraction and interpretable deep learning. Firstly, based on the established correlation mechanism among the molten pool, defects, and signals in the LPBF process, the effectiveness of acoustic feature representation in reflecting defect information is demonstrated. Secondly, the TFSST method is proposed to enhance the expression of the most relevant and physically reasonable time-frequency features of weak amplitude LPBF defect signals. Finally, the multi-scale spatially interactive fusion convolutional neural network (MSSIF-CNN) is proposed for in-situ monitoring of LPBF defects using an ABAE monitoring system. The proposed method can recognize five LPBF defects with an accuracy of 99.12 %. In addition, the visualization results verify that the model possesses superior adaptive defect feature extraction capabilities and effectively focuses on the most relevant and physically reasonable defect characterization information. With millisecond monitoring response times and physically interpretable defect monitoring decision-making capabilities, the method offers the potential for industrialized in-situ monitoring.

AB  - Despite the global sustainability trend, airport buildings have received limited attention regarding their environmental impact within the built environment and aviation sectors. With less than 1% of green building certifications worldwide, there is a lack of essential green performance assessment tools, including frameworks, primary datasets, and models that require less human supervision. Previous research has addressed these issues by proposing frameworks, primary datasets, and a supervised method that leverages Classification and Regression Trees. However, these methods still rely on human effort to fix credit scores and assign category weights, necessitating significant supervision from human experts. This study presents a green performance evaluation model for airport buildings using an explainable semi-supervised AI approach to reduce human dependency during the inference of green scores. Principal Component Analysis and Hierarchical Clustering algorithms (agglomerative and divisive) are employed to construct the models. The dataset's dimensionality is reduced based on metrics such as scatter coefficient, Psi Index, variation, and permutation. The cluster numbers are determined using elbow point and silhouette coefficient values, resulting in cluster initializations between 6 and 12. Performance measures, including the rand index, mean absolute error, precision, recall, F1-measure, and accuracy, are evaluated for the models. The AHC and DHC models exhibit a maximum accuracy of 74%, albeit with different cluster numbers. Consequently, models are developed with suitable cluster numbers to derive green rules with improved predictive accuracy. Each agglomerative and divisive hierarchical clustering model yields 12 practical green rules that can assist airport operators and facility managers in enhancing the green performance of their airport buildings. These explainable green rules serve as guidelines to improve airport facilities. Additionally, a web-based green rating tool is developed to demonstrate the proof-of-concept, utilizing the green rules extracted from the agglomerative model.

AB  - Granule description is one of the main challenges to realize explainable AI technologies through information granules. Specifically, granule description of incomplete data is still an open, interesting and important topic. In this study, this problem is studied systematically based on extent-intent view. Concretely, at first we define stable concepts and evanescent concepts in an incomplete formal context and propose their acquisition approaches, respectively. And then, we classify granules into two categories, i.e., basic granules and indefinable granules. After that, we present the descriptions of basic granules via stable concepts and evanescent concepts. Finally, we make some discussions on how to describe indefinable granules. The main contribution as well as the significant feature of this study is granule description of incomplete data based on ordinary formal concepts rather than approximate concepts. The analysis shows that the ordinary concept-based granule description is more concise and less complex than the approximate concept-based granule description, and meanwhile, the ordinary concept-based method can also maintain the same recall of granule description as that of the latter method. Our work will provide cognitive research method to the description of incomplete formal context with the help of concept cognition units.

AB  - Ever since Yau's non-constructive existence proof of Ricci-flat metrics on Calabi-Yau (CY) manifolds, finding their explicit construction remains a major obstacle to development of both string theory and algebraic geometry. Recent computational approaches employ machine learning to create novel neural representations for approximating these metrics, offering high accuracy but limited interpretability. In this paper, we analyse machine learning approximations to flat metrics of Fermat CY n-folds and some of their one-parameter deformations in three dimensions in order to discover their new properties. We formalise cases in which the flat metric has more symmetries than the underlying manifold, and prove that these symmetries imply that the flat metric admits a surprisingly compact representation for certain choices of complex structure moduli. We show that such symmetries uniquely determine the flat metric on certain loci on the Fermat manifold, for which we present an analytic form. We also incorporate our theoretical results into neural networks to reduce Ricci curvature for multiple CY manifolds compared to previous machine learning approaches. We conclude with distilling the ML models to obtain closed form expressions for K & auml;hler metrics with near-zero scalar curvature, discovering them directly from numerical data.

AB  - The past decade has witnessed a plethora of works that leverage the power of visualization (VIS) to interpret machine learning (ML) models. The corresponding research topic, VIS4ML, keeps growing at a fast pace. To better organize the enormous works and shed light on the developing trend of VIS4ML, we provide a systematic review of these works through this survey. Since data quality greatly impacts the performance of ML models, our survey focuses specifically on summarizing VIS4ML works from the data perspective. First, we categorize the common data handled by ML models into five types, explain the unique features of each type, and highlight the corresponding ML models that are good at learning from them. Second, from the large number of VIS4ML works, we tease out six tasks that operate on these types of data (i.e., data-centric tasks) at different stages of the ML pipeline to understand, diagnose, and refine ML models. Lastly, by studying the distribution of 143 surveyed papers across the five data types, six data-centric tasks, and their intersections, we analyze the prospective research directions and envision future research trends.

AB  - A sudden surge of data has created new challenges in water management, spanning quality control, assimilation, and analysis. Few approaches are available to integrate growing volumes of data into interpretable results. Process-based hydrologic models have not been designed to consume large amounts of data. Alternatively, new machine learning tools can automate data analysis and forecasting, but their lack of interpretability and reliance on very large data sets limits the discovery of insights and may impact trust. To address this gap, we present a new approach, which seeks to strike a middle ground between process-, and data-based modeling. The contribution of this work is an automated and scalable methodology that discovers differential equations and latent state estimations within hydrologic systems using only rainfall and runoff measurements. We show how this enables automated tools to learn interpretable models of 6 to 18 parameters solely from measurements. We apply this approach to nearly 400 stream gaging sites across the US, showing how complex catchment dynamics can be reconstructed solely from rainfall and runoff measurements. We also show how the approach discovers surrogate models that can replicate the dynamics of a much more complex process-based model, but at a fraction of the computational complexity. We discuss how the resulting representation of watershed dynamics provides insight and computational efficiency to enable automated predictions across large sensor networks.

AB  - Effective anomaly management of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is crucial for environmental conservation and public health security. Traditional monitoring methods often struggle with challenges such as multivariate coupling, nonlinear dynamics, and external interferences inherent in wastewater treatment processes, which has driven growing interest towards artificial intelligence (AI)-based anomaly management solutions. This paper critically reviews recent advancements in AI-based anomaly management strategies for WWTPs, emphasizing three integral aspects: sensor data quality control and self-calibration, early anomaly detection and diagnosis, and fault-tolerant control and resilience enhancement. Systematic comparisons are made among supervised, unsupervised, and transfer learning methods, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of deep learning, ensemble learning, and intelligent optimization algorithms in addressing practical engineering issues such as sensor noise, multimodal data distributions, imbalanced datasets, and limited cross-facility generalizability. The review further highlights real-world performance metrics beyond conventional accuracy, such as application scalability, anomaly detection timeliness, and technological adaptability. Key findings reveal research gaps hindering for the progress and application of AI-based anomaly management approaches in model interpretability, computational intensity, data quality controls, cross-facility generalization, and costeffectiveness. More importantly, future research directions cover adaptive learning techniques, explainable AI, integration of AI with digital twin platforms, lightweight infrastructures for real-time edge computing, and environmental and economic analysis of AI deployments in WWTPs.

AB  - Concrete architectural structures are widely used in urban construction, making the health diagnosis and maintenance of these structures increasingly essential and urgent. Crack identification is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and safety of buildings. Traditional methods rely on manual inspection, which is plagued by low accuracy, inefficiency, and safety hazards. This paper proposes a technique combining an attention-based SqueezeNet network with Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) for automatically recognizing and visually explaining building cracks. By integrating the Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) attention mechanism with the lightweight SqueezeNet network, this method can adaptively adjust the importance of feature channels by learning global information, effectively improving the network's accuracy and efficiency. The experimental results show that the Att-SqueezeNet model achieved a high precision of 0.995, a training time of only 133 seconds, and a model size of 4.9M, significantly outperforming models such as SqueezeNet, RF, CNN, VGG-19, and B-CNN. This demonstrates its robustness, rapid identification and suitability for practical applications and building crack identification. Moreover, the utilization of Grad-CAM for visualization not only offers an intuitive explanation of the model's decision-making process but also provides a more comprehensible understanding of crack detection results. This is crucial for advancing building maintenance automation, reducing reliance on manual labor, and increasing the precision and reliability of detection tasks.

AB  - Gas pipeline leaks contribute to one-third of methane emissions annually, posing environmental damage and safety risks. However, accurate and timely detection of the leak presents several challenges, including remote and inaccessible environments, low accuracy and efficiency, and high hardware and labor costs. To address these challenges, we propose a gas pipeline leakage detection architecture based on multiple multimodal deep feature selections and the optimized Improved Deep Forest Classifier (IDFC). First, the multimodal data, thermal images and gas sensor data, are pre-processed. Then a deep feature pool is constructed using the selected Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, including AlexNet, ResNet-50, MobileNet, VggNet, and EfficientNet, as well as their inner layers. Aided by the heatmaps created using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), a visualization-based primary feature selection is applied to determine the best features to form an initial CNN pool. The output of the flattened features from this CNN pool is then fed into the IDFC for classification. Hyperparameters of the base learners are then selected for an explainable and enhanced diversity tree-structured deep forest classifier, using the selected multimodal features as inputs. Finally, the Accuracy-Size Comprehensive Indicator (ASCI) is introduced for the secondary feature selection and the optimized deep forest classifier construction, which balances the model accuracy and size and reduces hardware resource requirements. Using the simulated testing dataset created for this research, our architecture demonstrated superior accuracy (98.9%) and deployability with its lower model size (115 MB). This lightweight AI architecture is successfully deployed on a soft robotic system for real-time gas leak detection. Our proposed architecture is also extensible to other environmental hazard detection situations, such as liquid leaks in the pipelines.

AB  - Practical, legal, and ethical reasons necessitate the development of methods to replace animal experiments. Computational techniques to acquire information that traditionally relied on animal testing are considered a crucial pillar among these so-called new approach methodologies. In this light, we recently introduced the BioQSAR concept for multispecies aquatic toxicity regression tasks. These machine learning models, trained on both chemical and biological information, are capable of both cross -chemical and cross -species predictions. Here, we significantly extend these models' applicability. This was realized by increasing the quantity of training data by a factor of approximately 20, accomplished by considering both additional chemicals and aquatic organisms. Additionally, variable test durations and associated random effects were accommodated by employing a machine learning algorithm that combines tree-boosting with mixed-effects modeling (i.e., Gaussian Process Boosting). We also explored various biological descriptors including Dynamic Energy Budget model parameters, taxonomic distances, as well as genus-specific traits and investigated the inclusion of mode -of -action information. Through these efforts, we developed Bio-QSARs for fish and aquatic invertebrates with exceptional predictive power (R squared of up to 0.92 on independent test sets). Moreover, we made considerable strides to make models applicable for a range of use cases in environmental risk assessment as well as research and development of chemicals. Models were made fully explainable by implementing an algorithmic multicollinearity correction combined with SHapley Additive exPlanations. Furthermore, we devised novel approaches for applicability domain construction that take feature importance into account. We are hence confident these models, which are available via open access, will make a significant contribution towards the implementation of new approach methodologies and ultimately have the potential to support "Green Chemistry" and "Green Toxicology".

AB  - Land-use change (LUC) impacts biospheric carbon, encompassing biomass carbon and soil organic carbon (SOC). Despite the use of dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) in estimating the anthropogenic perturbation of biospheric carbon stocks, critical evaluations of model performance concerning LUC impacts are scarce. Here, we present a systematic evaluation of the performance of the DGVM Organising Carbon and Hydrology in Dynamic Ecosystems (ORCHIDEE) in reproducing observed LUC impacts on biospheric carbon stocks over Europe. First, we compare model predictions with observation-based gridded estimates of net and gross primary productivity (NPP and GPP), biomass growth patterns, and SOC stocks. Second, we evaluate the predicted response of soil carbon stocks to LUC based on data from forest inventories, paired plots, chronosequences, and repeated sampling designs. Third, we use interpretable machine learning to identify factors contributing to discrepancies between simulations and observations, including drivers and processes not resolved in ORCHIDEE (e.g. erosion, soil fertility). Results indicate agreement between the model and observed spatial patterns and temporal trends, such as the increase in biomass with age, when simulating biosphere carbon stocks. The direction of the SOC responses to LUC generally aligns between simulated and observed data. However, the model underestimates carbon gains for cropland-to-grassland conversions and carbon losses for grassland-to-cropland and forest-to-cropland conversions. These discrepancies are attributed to bias arising from soil erosion rate, which is not fully captured in ORCHIDEE. Our study provides an oriented benchmark for assessing the DGVMs against observations and explores their potential in studying the impact of LUCs on SOC stocks.

AB  - As an important indicator of the surface quality of workpieces, surface roughness has a great impact on production costs and the quality performance of the finished components. Effective surface roughness prediction can not only increase productivity but also reduce costs. However, the current methods for surface roughness prediction have some limitations. On the one hand, the prediction accuracy of classical experimental and statistical-based surface roughness prediction methods is low. On the other hand, the results of deep learning-based surface roughness prediction methods are uninterpretable due to their black-box learning mechanism. Therefore, this paper presents an ensemble learning with a differential evolution algorithm, applies it to the prediction of surface roughness of abrasive water jet polishing (AWJP), and conducts an interpretability analysis to identify key factors contributing to the prediction accuracy of surface roughness. First, we proposed automatically constructing features by an Evolution Forest algorithm to train the base regression models. The differential evolution algorithm with a simplified encoding mechanism was then used to search for the best weighted-ensemble to integrate the base regression models for obtaining highly accurate prediction results. Extensive experiments have been conducted on AWJP to validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. The results show that the prediction accuracy of our proposed method is higher than the existing machine learning algorithms. In addition, this is the first of its time for the contributions of machining parameters (i.e., features) on surface roughness prediction by using interpretable analysis methods. The analysis results can provide a reference basis for subsequent experiments and studies.

AB  - PurposeTo establish a predictive model for the sonication energy required for focused ultrasound surgery (FUS) of breast fibroadenomas.MethodsThis study retrospectively enrolled 87 patients with 154 benign breast tumors treated by FUS in our hospital. Radiomic analysis included 124 tumors from 69 patients, randomly split into a 3:1 ratio for training (96 cases) and validation (28 cases). Three machine learning algorithms were applied for feature selection. Then, all the selected features were used for the construction of the prediction model via four machine learning algorithms. Residual analysis and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) analysis were performed to evaluate the performances of these four models. The importance of each feature is demonstrated by the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) loss obtained through permutation importance measurement.ResultsThis study collected 11 clinical features and 68 ultrasound radiomics features, totaling 79 independent variables. The Bagging Tree Model, characterized by lower and stable RMSE values and high R2 stability with increasing features, demonstrated superior predictive accuracy and explanatory power compared to other models. At the optimal feature count, identified by the minimum RMSE, 33 features were selected for further modeling. The bagging tree model has the highest ICC value among the four models, at 0.56, with a confidence interval of (0.23, 0.77).ConclusionsThis study established an interpretable machine learning model that integrates clinical and ultrasound radiomics features to estimate the sonication energy in FUS treatment of breast fibroadenomas.

AB  - ObjectiveThe agricultural sector is important in the supply of food globally as well as in enhancing the economy especially in developing countries where it forms the backbone of the economy. Corn can be classified as such crops important to the world's food system. Unfortunately, corn crop is vulnerable to a lot of diseases and this may result into heavy losses and disruption in the food supply system. Hence, it is important to detect and classify these diseases accurately and promptly to limit losses and achieve the highest possible productivity. This study intends to solve these problems by constructing a trustworthy and interpretable model based on deep learning approaches focused on accurate identification of corn leaf disease.MaterialIn this study, the cumulative dataset comprises 4188 images which are further divided into four classes of corn leaf disease, with 1146 images of blight leaf, 1306 images of common rust, 574 images of gray spot and 1162 images of healthy leaves. In order to train and validate the model 70% of data was used for training while 30% was used for testing. This division was appropriate because it allowed enough data to be used during model training and also enough for model evaluation on new data.MethodsThe research employs ResNet152, a well-known deep leaning structure in image classification, because uses residual connections that improve the training of deep networks. Furthermore, Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) is employed to improve the explainability of the model. Grad-CAM produces human interpretable visual images in the form of heatmaps and it indicates the areas of corn leaves that have had the greatest impact in the model, which is fairly useful in understanding the model. The model processes and predicts the corn leaves into four classes: healthy (H), blight (B), gray spot (GS) and common rust (CR), with precision and explainability.ResultsThe results of training the ResNet152 model were remarkable as it registered a 99.95% accuracy during training as well as 98.34% during testing. Also, applying Grad-CAM for interpretability purposes proved to be useful as it created heatmaps that indicated the most important parts of the leaf images for making the model predictions. This added to the understanding of the model and its predictions, which was especially important for users such as farmers who required accurate diagnoses of diseases.ConclusionThis study demonstrates the effectiveness of the ResNet152 model, enhanced with Grad-CAM for explainability, in classifying corn leaf diseases. Achieving good training and testing accuracy, the model provides transparent, human-readable explanations, fostering trust and reliability in automated disease diagnosis and aiding farmers in making better-informed decisions to improve crop yields.

AB  - Large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) is a heterogeneous lymphoid malignancy in which MYC gene rearrangement (MYC-R) MYC-R) is associated with a poor prognosis, prompting the recommendation for more intensive treatment. MYC-R detection relies on fluorescence in situ hybridization method which is time consuming, expensive, and not available in all laboratories. Automating MYC-R detection on hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained whole slide images of LBCL would decrease the need for costly molecular testing and improve pathologists' productivity. We developed an interpretable deep learning algorithm to detect MYC-R considering recent advances in self-supervised learning and providing an extensive comparison of 7 feature extractors and 6 multiple instance learning models, themselves. Four different multicentric cohorts, including 1247 patients with LBCL, were used for training and validation. The best deep learning model reached an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve score of 81.9% during crossvalidation on the largest LBCL cohort, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve scores ranging from 62.2% to 74.5% when evaluated on other unseen cohorts. In addition, we demonstrated that using this model as a prescreening tool (with a false-negative rate of 0%), fluorescence in situ hybridization testing would be avoided in 35% of cases. This work demonstrates the feasibility of developing a medical device to efficiently detect MYC gene rearrangement on hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained whole slide images in daily practice.

AB  - In tunnel construction, efficiently predicting the energy usage of tunnel boring machines (TBMs) is critical for optimizing operations and reducing costs. This research proposes a novel method for predicting the specific energy of micro slurry tunnel boring machines (MSTBMs) using an explainable neural network (xNN) that leverages operator-monitored data. The xNN model provides transparency and interpretability by integrating the Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) technique, enabling tunneling engineers and operators to gain valuable insights into the prediction process. Extensive data from MSTBM umbrella pipe support excavation are the foundation for training, testing, and unseen data in the xNN model. The specific energy formula derived from the operational parameters of the MSTBM defines the dependent variable for the xNN model. The test dataset evaluates the model's performance with an R-2 of 98.7%, an MSE of 2.40, and an MAE of 0.003, demonstrating its accuracy and reliability. Ten percent of the dataset was reserved as unseen data to assess the model's generalization capabilities. Upon evaluation, the model achieved an R 2 value of 89%, an MAE of 0.01, and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.01. The xNN empowers operators to optimize operational parameters and promote more efficient and sustainable tunneling practices by identifying influential factors affecting energy consumption through its interpretable nature. This research has significant implications for the future of underground construction, paving the way for improved resource management.

AB  - Soil erosion is a dominant geomorphic process and a critical determinant of ecological productivity in mountainous regions. Assessing its rate, spatial pattern, and controlling factors is essential for understanding and managing its impact. This study assesses soil erosion susceptibility in the Lidder watershed of the Greater Himalayas by combining the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) with six machine and deep learning (MDL) models and presents the first application of Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) based Game Theory for erosion modeling in the Himalayan region. The erosion map generated using RUSLE estimated annual soil loss (A) of 58.81 t ha(-1) yr(-1). It was used to delineate non-erosion zones (A < 1st quartile = 0.74 t ha(-1) yr(-1)) and erosion zones (A > 3rd quartile = 97.20 t ha(-1) yr(-1)) in the watershed. These zones formed inventory datasets for applying the MDL models with twenty-four soil erosion conditioning factors, including topographic, hydroclimatic, lithological, geomorphological, soil physiochemical, and landcover factors. Machine learning models outperformed deep learning-based models in soil erosion susceptibility assessment. Random Forest performed the best, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.96, area under the precision-recall curve of 0.96, and Cohen's Kappa (k) index of 0.76. This performance is attributed to its efficiency in learning from limited datasets and its ability to handle heterogeneous data effectively. The results reveal that 7.51%, 5.77%, 9.26%, 16.60%, 40.14%, and 20.72% of the watershed area exhibit negligible, minimal, moderate, high, severe, and extreme erosion potential, respectively. SHAP-based Game Theory revealed that slope, elevation, surface temperature, stream density, and bare ground were the strongest contributors to erosion risk, while vegetation cover, built-up, and agricultural terracing mitigated erosion. The study demonstrates that these anthropogenic activities counter the negative impacts of slope steepness on soil erosion in the mountainous areas.

The experimental results demonstrate that the optimal concrete mix containing 0.06% graphene, 0.5 vol% polypropylene, and 0.5 vol% steel fibers exhibited a maximum of 22%, 36%, and 14% increase in compressive strength, tensile strength, and elastic modulus relative to the control at 90 days. Additionally, the scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy images of the concrete specimens indicated the economic development of amorphous intermediate hydration products is the main reason for the growth of long-term mechanical properties of the concrete mixes. This study also investigates three machine learning techniques (k-Nearest Neighbors, polynomial regression and XGBoost) to predict the compressive strength of GNFRC utilizing datasets comprising 438 different mix proportions of GNFRC. Among them, the XGBoost model showed highest accuracy with an R2 of 0.994. The use of SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Partial Dependency Plot (PDP) analyses identified the most influential mix elements as cement and curing age on compressive strength. The findings ensure the potential of graphene and hybrid fibers to develop durable, high-performance concrete composites suitable for sustainable building applications.

AB  - To understand the black-box characteristics of deep networks, counterfactual explanation that deduces not only the important features of an input space but also how those features should be modified to classify input as a target class has gained an increasing interest. The patterns that deep networks have learned from a training dataset can be grasped by observing the feature variation among various classes. However, current approaches perform the feature modification to increase the classification probability for the target class irrespective of the internal characteristics of deep networks. This often leads to un-clear explanations that deviate from real-world data distributions. To address this problem, we propose a counterfactual explanation method that exploits the statistics learned from a training dataset. Especially, we gradually construct an explanation by iterating over masking and composition steps. The masking step aims to select an important feature from the input data to be classified as a target class. Mean-while, the composition step aims to optimize the previously selected feature by ensuring that its output score is close to the logit space of the training data that are classified as the target class. Experimental results show that our method produces human-friendly interpretations on various classification datasets and verify that such interpretations can be achieved with fewer feature modification.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Machine learning (ML) algorithms are now part of everyday life, as many technological devices use these algorithms. The spectrum of uses is wide, but it is evident that ML represents a revolution that may change almost every human activity. However, as for all innovations, it comes with challenges. One of the most critical of these challenges is providing users with an understanding of how models' output is related to input data. This is called "interpretability", and it is focused on explaining what feature influences a model's output. Some algorithms have a simple and easy-to-understand relationship between input and output, while other models are "black boxes" that return an output without giving the user information as to what influenced it. The lack of this knowledge creates a truthfulness issue when the output is inspected by a human, especially when the operator is not a data scientist. The Building and Construction sector is starting to face this innovation, and its scientific community is working to define best practices and models. This work is intended for developing a deep analysis to determine how interpretable ML models could be among the most promising future technologies for the energy management in built environments.

TI  - An XAI-enabled 2D-CNN model for non-destructive detection of natural adulterants in the wonder hot variety of red chilli powder
T2  - SUSTAINABLE FOOD TECHNOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - AI revolutionizes the food sector by improving production, supply chains, quality assurance, and consumer safety. Therefore, this work addresses the alarming issue of red chilli powder (RcP) adulteration, with the introduction of an AI-driven framework for RcP adulteration detection, leveraging an empirical evaluation of DenseNet-121 and 169. To optimize convergence and enhance the performance, the AdamClr optimizer was incorporated, in a learning rate range between 0.00005 and 0.01. Two datasets (DS I and DS II) were developed for evaluation of DenseNet models. DS I consists of two classes: Class 1 (Label = C1_PWH) representing pure RcP (variety = Wonder Hot (WH)) and Class 2 (Label = C2_AWH) containing samples adulterated with five natural adulterants (wheat bran (WB), rice hull (RB), wood saw (WS), and two low-grade RcP), whereas DS II comprises 16 classes, including one class of pure RcP and 15 classes representing adulterated RcP with varying concentrations of the five adulterants (each at 5%, 10%, and 15% concentration). For binary classification (for DS I), DenseNet-169 at batch size (BS) 16 delivered an accuracy of 99.99%, while, in multiclass classification (for DS II) for determination of the percentage of adulterant, DenseNet-169 at BS 64 produced the highest accuracy of 95.16%. Furthermore, Grad-CAM explains the DenseNet-169 predictions, amd the obtained heatmaps highlighting the critical regions influencing classification decisions. The proposed framework demonstrated high efficacy in detecting RcP adulteration in binary as well as multiclass classification. Overall, DenseNet-169 and XAI present a transformative approach for enhancing quality control and assurance in the spice industry.

AB  - This study aims to provide an effective and accurate machine learning approach to predict the compressive strength (CS) and flexural strength (FS) of 3D printed fiber reinforced concrete (3DPFRC). Six types of ML models were utilized in this study: random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), categorical gradient boosting (Catboost), and natural gradient boosting (NGBoost). The CS and FS data is collected from recent published papers and split into training set and testing set. The hyperparameter optimization techniques are applied to optimize the ML model parameters using a grid search strategy paired with the 5-fold cross-validation. In the testing set, XGBoost, LightGBM, Catboost, and NGBoost achieve high accuracy (R2 = 0.98, 0.98, 0.98, and 0.96, respectively) on CS prediction, which is better than that of RF and SVM (R2 = 0.90 and 0.92, respectively). High accuracy on FS prediction is also obtained in XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and NGBoost (R2 = 0.94, 0.93, 0.92, and 0.90, respectively). Furthermore, the relative importance of input variables' contribution to the mechanical performance of 3DP-FRC is disclosed via Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) analysis. The SHAP analysis identifies that water/binder ratio and ordinary Portland cement content are the most influential parameters for CS, while the loading direction and fiber volume fraction are the most significant parameters for FS. The ML models incorporated with SHAP analysis disclose the relationship between the input variables and mechanical performance of 3DP-FRC and could provide valuable information for the performance-based design of the mix proportion of 3DP-FRC.

AB  - In an ever-increasing interest for Machine Learning (ML) and a favorable data development context, we here propose an original methodology for data-based prediction of two-dimensional physical fields. Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE), widely used in the Uncertainty Quantification community (UQ), has long been employed as a robust representation for probabilistic input-to-output mapping. It has been recently tested in a pure ML context, and shown to be as powerful as classical ML techniques for point-wise prediction. Some advantages are inherent to the method, such as its explicitness and adaptability to small training sets, in addition to the associated probabilistic framework. Simultaneously, Dimensionality Reduction (DR) techniques are increasingly used for pattern recognition and data compression and have gained interest due to improved data quality. In this study, the interest of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) for the construction of a statistical predictive model is demonstrated. Both POD and PCE have amply proved their worth in their respective frameworks. The goal of the present paper was to combine them for a field measurement-based forecasting. The described steps are also useful to analyze the data. Some challenging issues encountered when using multidimensional field measurements are addressed, for example when dealing with few data. The POD-PCE coupling methodology is presented, with particular focus on input data characteristics and training-set choice. A simple methodology for evaluating the importance of each physical parameter is proposed for the PCE model and extended to the POD-PCE coupling. (c) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - To develop and validate a machine learning (ML) model which combined computed tomography (CT) semantic and radiomics features to preoperatively predict Ki-67 expression in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) patients. We retrospectively collected the clinical, imaging and pathological data of 149 GISTs patients. We randomly assigned the patients in a ratio of 7:3 to a training set (104 cases) and a validation (45 cases) set. We divided the patients into low and high Ki-67 expression group according to postoperative pathology. CT semantic features were analyzed from preoperative enhancement CT images and radiomics features were extracted from venous phase-enhanced images. We used intraclass correlation coefficient, maximal relevance and minimal redundancy and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method to screen radiomics features and build radiomics label. 6 ML models were used for model construction. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to evaluate the predictive efficiency of ML models. SHAP analysis was used to explain the contribution of different variables and their risk threshold. AUC of radscores in predicting Ki-67 expression of GIST patients were 0.749 and 0.729 in training and validation set. Among the 6 ML models, SVM exhibited best prediction accuracy. AUC of SVM model in predicting Ki-67 expression of GIST patients were 0.840, 0.767 and 0.832 in training, validation and test set. SHAP analysis showed that radscores and tumor diameter had highly positive contribution to the model. Therefore, the interpretable SVM model can predict Ki-67 expression of GISTs patients individually before surgery, which can provide reliable imaging biomarkers for clinical treatment decisions.

AB  - Carbon emissions from global warming pose significant threats to both regional ecology and sustainable development. Understanding the factors affecting emissions is critical to developing effective carbon neutral strategies. This study constructed a precise 1 km resolution net carbon emissions map of Hubei Province, China (2000-2020), and compared the ten distinct machine learning models to identify the most effective model for revealing the relationship between carbon emissions and their influencing factors. The random forest regressor (RFR) demonstrates optimal performance, achieving root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) values that are nearly 10 times lower on average than the other models. The results are interpreted using Shapley additive explanation (SHAP), revealing dynamic factor impacts. Our findings include the following. (1) Between 2000 and 2020, net carbon emissions in Hubei increased threefold, with emissions from construction land rising by approximately 7.5 times over the past two decades. Woodland, a major carbon sink, experienced a downward trend. (2) Six key factors are population, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), road density, PM2.5, the degree of urbanization, and the industrial scale, with only the NDVI reducing emissions. (3) Net carbon emissions displayed significant spatial differences and aggregation and are mainly concentrated in the central urban areas of Hubei Province. Overall, this study evaluates various regression models and identifies the primary factors influencing net carbon emissions. The net carbon emission map we have developed can visually identify and locate high-emission hotspots and vulnerable carbon sink areas, thereby providing a direct basis for provincial land use planning.

AB  - Accurate classification of surrounding rock grades during Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) operations is essential for optimizing excavation parameters and ensuring construction safety. However, traditional classification methods face challenges, particularly in adapting to complex geological conditions and achieving high efficiency in model optimization. To address these issues, this study proposes an identification methodology based on the COA-XGBoost framework. Initially, raw data is preprocessed to eliminate anomalous instances, such as those arising from equipment malfunctions or maintenance activities, using a state discrimination function. To better capture the interaction dynamics between the TBM and the surrounding rock, a novel feature parameter, specific energy, is introduced. The Relief algorithm is employed to evaluate feature importance and assign weights to TBM operational parameters, amplifying the role of critical features while minimizing interference from redundant ones. Subsequently, the Coati Optimization Algorithm (COA) is integrated with the XGBoost classifier, enabling global parameter optimization and enhancing the model's performance. The proposed method was validated using data from the water conveyance tunnel section of the Yinchuojiliao Project. Results demonstrate that the Relief algorithm effectively enhances the model's ability to identify critical parameters through feature weighting. The COA-optimized XGBoost model achieves a significant improvement in recognition accuracy compared to traditional approaches, with accuracy gains of approximately 8%, particularly excelling under complex geological conditions such as Class IV and Class V surrounding rocks. The final model achieves an accuracy of 91.5%, with recall and F1 scores reaching 91.5% and 91.4%, respectively. Additionally, five-fold cross-validation highlights the model's robustness and generalization capabilities. Furthermore, a SHAP-based interpretability analysis clarifies the relative contributions of each feature to the classification outcome, offering valuable insights for practical TBM parameter optimization.

AB  - Understanding the shear strength parameters (SSP) of lunar soil, specifically the internal friction angle () and cohesion (c), is essential for the structural stability and feasibility of future lunar base construction. Laboratory testing is constrained by the limited availability of lunar soil samples and the challenges in simulating lunar environmental conditions, while in-situ testing on the lunar surface remains prohibitively costly. Satellite observations, though useful, introduce significant uncertainties. Therefore, utilizing existing data to uncover commonalities and predict the shear strength parameters of lunar soil is increasingly vital. This paper presents a machine learning-based approach to improve the prediction efficiency of and c. A comprehensive dataset was constructed from lunar soil simulants, and missing data were addressed through five imputation methods. Subsequently, four machine learning models (SVM, BPNN, RF, and XGBoost) were developed, with SHAP values and partial dependence plots (PDP) enhancing model interpretability. The results demonstrate that the KNN imputation technique effectively leveraged local similarities in the data to fill missing values, and the XGBoost model exhibited the best performance in the prediction task. Key features influencing the predictions included relative density (Dr), minimum density (pmin), maximum density (pmax), uniformity coefficient (Cu), and curvature coefficient (Cc). The model's predictions for the SSP of real lunar soil were highly consistent with the reference values. The absolute values of errors for are range from 1.53 degrees to 4.33 degrees, while the deviation of c from the reference values ranges from 2.18 to 4.99 kPa. (c) 2025 COSPAR.

AB  - Background: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) often encounter complications such as sleep disorders, which are of great detriment to their quality of life, and earlier identification and intervention can effectively improve the prognosis of patients.Objectives: In this study, we worked on building a risk model to assess IBD-related sleep disorders using a machine learning (ML) approach.Design: Observational study.Methods: Based on an online questionnaire, we collected clinical data from 2478 IBD patients from 42 hospitals in 22 Chinese provinces between September 2021 and May 2022. Then, we developed and validated six common ML models to assess the risk of co-morbid sleep disorders in IBD patients, and evaluated and compared the performance of these models using relevant metrics. Finally, the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations algorithm (Lime) was utilized to interpret the results of the best ML model.Results: In this study, after multidimensional comparisons, the voting model was finally identified as superior among several models, with the area under the curve and accuracy reaching 0.76 and 0.74, respectively. After calculations, it was found that the co-morbidities of depression and anxiety, an older age, outpatient diagnosis, and a longer course of the disease were all indicative of a higher risk of sleep disorders among IBD patients in this model.Conclusion: The construction of risk assessment models using ML has high clinical value in the prediction of IBD-related sleep disorders, and the efficacy of its application suggests it can serve as a promising evaluation tool in clinical work.

AB  - Background In this work, we developed many machine learning classifiers to assist in diagnosing respiratory changes associated with sarcoidosis, based on results from the Forced Oscillation Technique (FOT), a non-invasive method used to assess pulmonary mechanics. In addition to accurate results, there is a particular interest in their interpretability and explainability, so we used Genetic Programming since the classification is made with intelligible expressions and we also evaluate the feature importance in different experiments to find the more discriminative features. Methodology/principal findings We used genetic programming in its traditional tree form and a grammar-based form. To check if interpretable results are competitive, we compared their performance to K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, AdaBoost, Random Forest, LightGBM, XGBoost, Decision Trees and Logistic Regressor. We also performed experiments with fuzzy features and tested a feature selection technique to bring even more interpretability. The data used to feed the classifiers come from the FOT exams in 72 individuals, of which 25 were healthy, and 47 were diagnosed with sarcoidosis. Among the latter, 24 showed normal conditions by spirometry, and 23 showed respiratory changes. The results achieved high accuracy (AUC > 0.90) in two analyses performed (controls vs. individuals with sarcoidosis and normal spirometry and controls vs. individuals with sarcoidosis and altered spirometry). Genetic Programming and Grammatical Evolution were particularly beneficial because they provide intelligible expressions to make the classification. The observation of which features were selected most frequently also brought explainability to the study of sarcoidosis. Conclusions The proposed system may provide decision support for clinicians when they are struggling to give a confirmed clinical diagnosis. Clinicians may reference the prediction results and make better decisions, improving the productivity of pulmonary function services by AI-assisted workflow.

AB  - Future missions to icy ocean worlds (OW) such as Europa and Enceladus will evaluate the habitability and potential for biosignatures on these worlds. These missions will benefit from autonomous science and machine learning (ML) methods to process high volumes of data and prioritize signals of interest for the first available downlink. Mass spectrometers (MS) are suitable instruments for implementing science autonomy due to their rich spectral data products and potential for biosignature detection. Light stable isotopes are strong candidates for biosignatures due to the large fractionations promoted by biological activity. However, complex abiotic geochemistry may obscure or mimic biogenic isotope fractionations. ML may accurately disentangle biosignatures from abiotic mimicry in MS data; however, ML model predictions can be inscrutable to human interpretation, compromising trust in scientifically significant detections. We develop and test a new biosignature detection ML model using a novel, laboratory-generated, CO2 isotopologue data set of analogue OW samples. These data include various potential OW seawater chemistries and biotic mimicry. Our ML approach includes feature (variable) construction, providing mathematical and geochemical context for biosignatures, and a feature selection method called Nearest-neighbors Projected Distance Regression (NPDR) that identifies important predictors. Our Random Forest biosignature model predicts the presence of biosignatures with 87.3% mean accuracy regardless of the sample brine chemistry. We add network visualization of main effects and statistical interactions for interpretation of model prediction mechanisms. We use single-sample (local) variable importance scores to diagnose false predictions for individual samples, which is crucial for trust in astrobiology ML biosignature models.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to develop a machine learning-based model for the objective assessment of CT pulmonary angiography Patients and Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted using data from 99 patients who underwent CTPA between March 2022 and January 2023, alongside two public datasets, FUMPE (21 cases) and CAD-PE (30 cases). In total, 150 cases from multiple centers were included in this analysis. The dataset was randomly split into a training set (105 cases) and a testing set (45 cases) in a 7:3 ratio. CT values and their standard deviations (SD) were measured in 11 specific regions of interest, and two radiologists independently assigned anonymous random scores to the images. The average of their subjective scores was used as the target output for the model, which was the mean opinion score (MOS) for image quality. Feature selection was performed using the Lasso algorithm and Pearson correlation coefficient, and a random forest regression model was constructed. Model performance was evaluated using mean square error (MSE), coefficient of determination (R2), Pearson linear correlation coefficient (PLCC), Spearman rank correlation coefficient (SRCC), and Kendall rank correlation coefficient (KRCC). Results: After feature selection, three key features were retained: main pulmonary artery CT value, ascending aorta CT value, and the difference in noise values between the left and right main pulmonary arteries. The random forest regression model constructed achieved MSE, R2_score, PLCC, SRCC, and KRCC values of 0.2001, 0.6695, 0.8682, 0.8694, 0.7363, respectively, on the testing set. Conclusion: This study successfully developed an interpretable machine learning-based model for the objective assessment of CTPA image quality. The model offers effective support for improving image quality control efficiency and precision. However, the limited sample size may affect the model's generalizability, so it's essential to conduct further research with larger datasets.

AB  - The public transportation sector generates large volumes of sensor data that, if analyzed adequately, can help anticipate failures and initiate maintenance actions, thereby enhancing quality and productivity. This work contributes to a real-time data-driven predictive maintenance solution for Intelligent Transportation Systems. The proposed method implements a processing pipeline comprised of sample pre-processing, incremental classification with Machine Learning models, and outcome explanation. This novel online processing pipeline has two main highlights: (i) a dedicated sample pre-processing module, which builds statistical and frequency-related features on the fly, and (ii) an explainability module. This work is the first to perform online fault prediction with natural language and visual explainability. The experiments were performed with the Metropt data set from the metro operator of Porto, Portugal. The results are above 98 % for f-measure and 99 % for accuracy. In the context of railway predictive maintenance, achieving these high values is crucial due to the practical and operational implications of accurate failure prediction. In the specific case of a high f-measure, this ensures that the system maintains an optimal balance between detecting the highest possible number of real faults and minimizing false alarms, which is crucial for maximizing service availability. Furthermore, the accuracy obtained enables reliability, directly impacting cost reduction and increased safety. The analysis demonstrates that the pipeline maintains high performance even in the presence of class imbalance and noise, and its explanations effectively reflect the decision-making process. These findings validate the methodological soundness of the approach and confirm its practical applicability for supporting proactive maintenance decisions in real-world railway operations. Therefore, by identifying the early signs of failure, this pipeline enables decision-makers to understand the underlying problems and act accordingly swiftly.

AB  - Hydraulic fracturing is a crucial method in shale oil development, and predicting production after hydraulic fracturing is one of the challenges in shale oil development. Conventional methods for predicting production include analytical methods and numerical simulation methods, but these methods involve many parameters, have high uncertainty, and are time-consuming and costly. With the development of shale oil development, there are more and more sample data on the geological parameters, engineering parameters, and development parameters of shale oil hydraulic fracturing, making it possible to use machine learning methods to predict production after hydraulic fracturing. This article first analyzes the impact of different parameters on initial production and recoverable reserves based on field data from Chang-7 shale oil in the Ordos Basin of China. Then, using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm and the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) algorithm, machine learning models for initial production and recoverable reserves are established. The Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) explanation methods are used to explain the models. The study found that initial production is highly correlated with parameters such as the number of fracturing stages and fracturing fluid volume, while recoverable reserves are significantly related to parameters such as well spacing, area, and reserver-controlled. The PSO-GBDT model established in this study has an accuracy of over 85% and can be used for production prediction and subsequent parameter optimization research. By comparing the LIME and SHAP local explanation methods, it is shown that different explanation methods can obtain reasonable and credible local explanation results. This article establishes a high-precision shale oil well production prediction model and two model interpretation methods, which could provide technical support for shale oil well production prediction and production analysis.

AB  - Herbal medicines have significant industrial value in East Asia. Zizyphus jujuba Mill. var. spinosa, used in Korea for treating insomnia, is often confused with Zizyphus mauritiana Lam., which has unverified medicinal properties yet is sold at premium prices. This misclassification undermines consumer trust and poses health risks. This study proposes a deep learning-based classification system trained on RGB-GE data, combining grayscale and edge-detected images with RGB inputs to enhance feature extraction while reducing color-dependency. Our method achieves superior generalization while maintaining cost-effectiveness. The system incorporates Grad-CAM for model interpretation and reliability. By comparing accuracy and speed across basicCNN, DenseNet, and InceptionV3 models, we identified an optimal solution for on-site herbal medicine classification, achieving 98.36% accuracy with basicCNN, ensuring reliable quality control.

AB  - The Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) is an interpretable neural network that leverages high-level concepts to explain model decisions and conduct human-machine interaction. However, in real-world scenarios, the deficiency of informative concepts can impede the model's interpretability and subsequent interventions. This paper proves that insufficient concept information can lead to an inherent dilemma of concept and label distortions in CBM. To address this challenge, we propose the Decoupling Concept Bottleneck Model (DCBM), which comprises two phases: 1) DCBM for prediction and interpretation, which decouples heterogeneous information into explicit and implicit concepts while maintaining high label and concept accuracy, and 2) DCBM for human-machine interaction, which automatically corrects labels and traces wrong concepts via mutual information estimation. The construction of the interaction system can be formulated as a light min-max optimization problem. Extensive experiments expose the success of alleviating concept/label distortions, especially when concepts are insufficient. In particular, we propose the Concept Contribution Score (CCS) to quantify the interpretability of DCBM. Numerical results demonstrate that CCS can be guaranteed by the Jensen-Shannon divergence constraint in DCBM. Moreover, DCBM expresses two effective human-machine interactions, including forward intervention and backward rectification, to further promote concept/label accuracy via interaction with human experts.

AB  - BackgroundRisk stratification of elderly patients with ischemic stroke (IS) who are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) remains a challenging task. This study aims to establish and validate predictive models that are based on novel machine learning (ML) algorithms for 28-day in-hospital mortality in elderly patients with IS who were admitted to the ICU. MethodsData of elderly patients with IS were extracted from the electronic intensive care unit (eICU) Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) records of those elderly patients admitted between 2014 and 2015. All selected participants were randomly divided into two sets: a training set and a validation set in the ratio of 8:2. ML algorithms, such as Naive Bayes (NB), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (xgboost), and logistic regression (LR), were applied for model construction utilizing 10-fold cross-validation. The performance of models was measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis and accuracy. The present study uses interpretable ML methods to provide insight into the model's prediction and outcome using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method. ResultsAs regards the population demographics and clinical characteristics, the analysis in the present study included 1,236 elderly patients with IS in the ICU, of whom 164 (13.3%) died during hospitalization. As regards feature selection, a total of eight features were selected for model construction. In the training set, both the xgboost and NB models showed specificity values of 0.989 and 0.767, respectively. In the internal validation set, the xgboost model identified patients who died with an AUC value of 0.733 better than the LR model which identified patients who died with an AUC value of 0.627 or the NB model 0.672. ConclusionThe xgboost model shows the best predictive performance that predicts mortality in elderly patients with IS in the ICU. By making the ML model explainable, physicians would be able to understand better the reasoning behind the outcome.

AB  - Deep learning algorithms (DLAs) are becoming hot tools in processing geochemical survey data for mineral exploration. However, it is difficult to understand their working mechanisms and decision-making behaviors, which may lead to unreliable results. The construction of a reliable and interpretable DLA has become a focus in data-driven geoscience discovery. This study utilized a SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) framework, a popular post-hoc interpretability analysis method, incorporated with the variational autoencoder (VAE) to explore the contribution of geochemical elements for multivariate geochemical anomaly recognition. The sorting of element importance obtained by SHAP tool can provide a novel view for selecting a suitable elemental association related to mineralization. Based on the metallogenic model in the southeastern Hubei Province of China, a metallogenic-factor-based VAE model was constructed using an ad-hoc interpretable modeling technique. The interpretability of the model in identifying the abnormal distribution of the element associations can be improved by constructing a hidden layer and loss function containing metallogenic regularity and key metallogenic factors. The highly anomalous areas identified by the metallogenic-factor VAE model not only contain most of the known Au deposits, but also can reasonably identify the abnormal elemental associations related to ore-forming processes under the guidance of the metallogenic regularity. According to the output visualization of the new hidden layer, and the results of receiver operating characteristic curve and success-rate curve, the metallogenic-factor VAE model exhibits satisfied interpretability and performance. The geochemical anomalies identified in this study provide critical clues for future mineral exploration.

AB  - Concrete is a cost-effective construction material widely used in various building infrastructure projects. High-performance concrete, characterized by strength and durability, is crucial for structures that must withstand heavy loads and extreme weather conditions. Accurate prediction of concrete strength under different mixtures and loading conditions is essential for optimizing performance, reducing costs, and enhancing safety. Recent advancements in machine learning offer solutions to challenges in structural engineering, including concrete strength prediction. This paper evaluated the performance of eight popular machine learning models, encompassing regression methods such as Linear, Ridge, and LASSO, as well as tree-based models like Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost, SVM, and ANN. The assessment was conducted using a standard dataset comprising 1030 concrete samples. Our experimental results demonstrated that ensemble learning techniques, notably XGBoost, outperformed other algorithms with an R-Square (R2) of 0.91 and a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 4.37. Additionally, we employed the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) technique to analyze the XGBoost model, providing civil engineers with insights to make informed decisions regarding concrete mix design and construction practices.

AB  - This study introduces an uncertainty-aware AI-driven optimization framework for designing sustainable concrete mixtures that incorporate waste-derived materials. The primary objectives are to reduce global warming potential (GWP) and promote a circular economy within the construction sector while preserving mechanical characteristics. A comprehensive dataset comprising 3114 unique concrete mix designs was developed from peer-reviewed literature, encompassing a wide range of parameters including cement (102-783 kg/m3), water (80-247 kg/m3), various supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) (0-715 kg/m3), waste-derived fine aggregates (0-740 kg/m3), coarse aggregates (0-1095 kg/m3), natural coarse (0-1380 kg/m3), and fine aggregates (0-992 kg/m3). The Explainable Boosting Regressor (EBR) demonstrated the highest predictive accuracy, with R2 values of 0.91 for compressive strength and 0.96 for GWP. The Weighted Jackknife + method provides narrow, localized uncertainty bounds, thereby enhancing the model reliability for heterogeneous mixes. Analyses of feature importance and shape functions identified cement, curing age, water, and GGBS as the most influential parameters. High-strength mixes are associated with a greater environmental impact owing to increased cement usage. A multi-objective optimization approach was employed, utilizing EBR as the objective function for compressive strength and GWP, whereas polynomial regression was used for the cost objective function to minimize the GWP and material cost while satisfying user-defined strength constraints. The framework incorporated nonlinear constraints in accordance with IS:10262-2019 standards. A graphical user interface (GUI) was developed for practical deployment. Among the evaluated combinations, the ternary blend of cement, GGBS, and waste glass achieved the highest waste utilization (960 kg/m3), whereas fly ash and metakaolin-based mixes demonstrated a greater avoided GWP while meeting the M35-grade requirements. These findings underscore the potential of interpretable uncertainty-aware AI tools for guiding sustainable concrete design at scale.

The aim of this work was the quantitative estimation of the wine grape ripeness, for four different grape varieties, by using a highly accurate contact probe spectrometer that covers the entire VNIR-SWIR spectrum (350-2500 nm). The four varieties under examination were Chardonnay, Malagouzia, Sauvignon-Blanc, and Syrah and all the samples were collected over the 2020 and 2021 harvest and pre-harvest phenological stages (corresponding to stages 81 through 89 of the BBCH scale) from the vineyard of Ktima Gerovassiliou located in Northern Greece. All measurements were performed in situ and a refractometer was used to measure the total soluble solids content (degrees Brix) of the grapes, providing the ground truth data. After the development of the grape spectra library, four different machine learning algorithms, namely Partial Least Squares regression (PLS), Random Forest regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), coupled with several pre-treatment methods were applied for the prediction of the degrees Brix content from the VNIR-SWIR hyperspectral data. The performance of the different models was evaluated using a cross-validation strategy with three metrics, namely the coefficient of the determination (R-2), the root mean square error (RMSE), and the ratio of performance to interquartile distance (RPIQ). High accuracy was achieved for Malagouzia, Sauvignon-Blanc, and Syrah from the best models developed using the CNN learning algorithm (R-2 > 0.8, RPIQ >= 4), while a good fit was attained for the Chardonnay variety from SVR (R-2 = 0.63, RMSE = 2.10, RPIQ = 2.24), proving that by using a portable spectrometer the in situ estimation of the wine grape maturity could be provided. The proposed methodology could be a valuable tool for wine producers making real-time decisions on harvest time and with a non-destructive way.

AB  - Plant leaf diseases are a significant concern in agriculture due to their detrimental impact on crop productivity and food security. Effective disease management depends on the early and accurate detection and diagnosis of these conditions, facilitating timely intervention and mitigation strategies. In this study, we address the pressing need for accurate and efficient methods for detecting leaf diseases by introducing a new architecture called DenseNet201Plus. DenseNet201 was modified by including superior data augmentation and pre-processing techniques, an attention-based transition mechanism, multiple attention modules, and dense blocks. These modifications enhance the robustness and accuracy of the proposed DenseNet201Plus model in diagnosing diseases related to plant leaves. The proposed architecture was trained using two distinct datasets: Banana Leaf Disease and Black Gram Leaf Disease. Through extensive experimentation, we evaluated the performance of DenseNet201Plus in terms of various classification metrics and achieved values of 0.9012, 0.9012, 0.9012, and 0.9716 for accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC for the banana leaf disease dataset, respectively. Similarly, the black gram leaf disease dataset model provides values of 0.9950, 0.9950, 0.9950, and 1.0 for accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC. Compared to other well-known pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, our proposed model demonstrates superior performance in both utilized datasets. Last but not least, we combined the strength of Grad-CAM++ with our proposed model to enhance the interpretability and localization of disease areas, providing valuable insights for agricultural practitioners and researchers to make informed decisions and optimize disease management strategies.

AB  - The field of digital histopathology has seen incredible growth in recent years. Digital pathology is becoming a relevant tool in healthcare, industrial and research sectors to reduce the saturation of pathology departments and improve the productivity of pathologists by increasing diagnostic accuracy and reducing turnaround times. Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms may be used for the identification of relevant regions, extraction of features from a histological image and overall classification of images into specific classes. The combination of digital histopathology imaging and AI therefore presents a significant opportunity for the support of the pathologists' tasks and opens up a whole new world of computational analysis. In this paper, we have analysed the present, the challenges and the future of the computational pathology discussing the different existing strategies to overcome its main limitations and ensure the computational pathology acceptance. The lack of labelled data, which is the possibly largest challenge for all medical AI applications, is even more pronounced in computational pathology because of the multi-gigapixel nature of the images and high data heterogeneity. We consider the future of the computational pathology is the combination of weak label strategies with active learning and crowdsourcing scenarios since it would remove some of the workload from clinical experts and manual annotation obtaining clinically satisfactory performance with minimal annotation effort. In addition, we believe areas such as explainable AI, data fusion and secure role-based data sharing will be receiving increasing research attention in computational pathology in the close future.

TI  - Contrastive Explanations of Plans Through Model Restrictions
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH
LA  - English
AB  - In automated planning, the need for explanations arises when there is a mismatch between a proposed plan and the user's expectation. We frame Explainable AI Planning as an iterative plan exploration process, in which the user asks a succession of contrastive questions that lead to the generation and solution of hypothetical planning problems that are restrictions of the original problem. The object of the exploration is for the user to understand the constraints that govern the original plan and, ultimately, to arrive at a satisfactory plan. We present the results of a user study that demonstrates that when users ask questions about plans, those questions are usually contrastive, i.e. "why A rather than B?". We use the data from this study to construct a taxonomy of user questions that often arise during plan exploration. Our approach to iterative plan exploration is a process of successive model restriction. Each contrastive user question imposes a set of constraints on the planning problem, leading to the construction of a new hypothetical planning problem as a restriction of the original. Solving this restricted problem results in a plan that can be compared with the original plan, admitting a contrastive explanation. We formally define model-based compilations in PDDL2.1 for each type of constraint derived from a contrastive user question in the taxonomy, and empirically evaluate the compilations in terms of computational complexity. The compilations were implemented as part of an explanation framework supporting iterative model restriction. We demonstrate its benefits in a second user study.

AB  - Decision trees (DTs) are a type of machine learning technique used for classification and regression problems. They are considered to be a part of explainable artificial intelligence due to their transparent and interpretable nature. The traditional approach in building DTs involves a top-down greedy search, which is usually fast but may result in a sub-optimal solution. An alternative method is evolutionary induction. It allows for more global exploration and can lead to simpler DTs, but it is computationally more expensive. To speed up the induction, different parallel approaches have been considered, with the GPU-based ones being the most efficient. In this paper, we extend the GPU-supported algorithm of DT evolutionary induction to use less memory and time resources. An improved in-memory representation of DTs is introduced, which adapts depending on the tree structure. Two types are possible: compact and complete representations. A compact one is used for DTs that are sparsely filled. It contains only existing tree nodes and therefore the links between parent and child nodes must be explicitly stored (along with the data). On the other hand, a complete representation is applied when the tree levels are densely filled. Then, placeholders for all potential nodes are reserved and the parent position can be easily calculated based on the child's place (and vice versa). The algorithm switches between the representations based on a density factor of tree filling. To validate our concept, we conducted experiments on both real-life and artificial datasets with varying sizes and dimensions. The results show that the DT in-memory representation affects the time and memory requirements a lot. The most efficient is the adaptive one. It not only speeds up the induction time but also reduces memory requirements (in terms of both transfer and occupancy). As a result, the evolutionary induction of DTs is closer to being competitive with state-of-the-art greedy inducers in terms of computation time.

AB  - Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membranous structures released by cells into the extracellular space and are thought to be involved in cell-to-cell communication. While EVs and their cargo are promising biomarker candidates, sorting mechanisms of proteins to EVs remain unclear. In this study, we ask if it is possible to determine EV association based on the protein sequence. Additionally, we ask what the most important determinants are for EV association. We answer these questions with explainable AI models, using human proteome data from EV databases to train and validate the model. It is essential to correct the datasets for contaminants introduced by coarse EV isolation workflows and for experimental bias caused by mass spectrometry. In this study, we show that it is indeed possible to predict EV association from the protein sequence: a simple sequence-based model for predicting EV proteins achieved an area under the curve of 0.77 +/- 0.01, which increased further to 0.84 +/- 0.00 when incorporating curated post-translational modification (PTM) annotations. Feature analysis shows that EV-associated proteins are stable, polar, and structured with low isoelectric point compared to non-EV proteins. PTM annotations emerged as the most important features for correct classification; specifically, palmitoylation is one of the most prevalent EV sorting mechanisms for unique proteins. Palmitoylation and nitrosylation sites are especially prevalent in EV proteins that are determined by very strict isolation protocols, indicating they could potentially serve as quality control criteria for future studies. This computational study offers an effective sequence-based predictor of EV associated proteins with extensive characterisation of the human EV proteome that can explain for individual proteins which factors contribute to their EV association.

AB  - Automated welding defect detection has emerged as a pivotal aspect of quality assurance in high-stakes industries such as aerospace, oil and gas, and construction. This paper presents a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art Deep Learning (DL) models tailored for welding defect detection, segmentation, and classification, emphasizing technical advancements and persistent challenges. A critical analysis of single-stage and two-stage architectures is conducted to evaluate their ability to address issues like small defect sizes, low image contrast, and diverse defect geometries. The study also highlights the integration of advanced preprocessing techniques, such as noise reduction and contrast enhancement, within DL workflows to improve feature extraction and detection accuracy. Persistent challenges, such as the scarcity of large, labeled datasets, lack of real-time applicability, and limited model interpretability, are explored in depth. To address these gaps, the survey proposes future directions, including the use of self-supervised learning, domain adaptation, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and explainable AI techniques to enhance the robustness, scalability, and transparency of welding defect detection systems. By synthesizing insights from more than a decade of research, this paper provides a detailed roadmap for advancing automated welding inspection technologies, enabling reliable deployment in real-world industrial environments.

AB  - Pressure insoles allow for the collection of real time pressure data inside and outside a laboratory setting as they are non-intrusive and can be simply integrated into industrial environments for occupational health and safety monitoring purposes. Activity detection is important for the safety and wellbeing of workers, and the present study aims to employ pressure insoles to detect the type of industry-related task an individual is performing by using random forest, an artificial intelligence-based classification technique. Twenty subjects wore loadsol (R) pressure insoles and performed five specific tasks associated with a typical workflow: standing, walking, pick and place, assembly, and manual handling. For each activity, statistical and morphological features were extracted to create a training dataset. The classifier performed with an accuracy of 82%, and a re-analysis focusing on the five most influential features resulted in 83% accuracy. These accuracies are comparable to similar task classification studies but with the benefit of added explainability, which increases transparency and, thereby, trust in the classifier decisions. The combination of random forest and in-depth feature analysis (SHAP) provided insights into the importance of certain features and the impact of their value on the classification of each task. The insights obtained from these methods can aid in the design of pressure insoles that are optimized for the extraction of impactful features and the prevention of work-related musculoskeletal disorders in Industry 4.0 operators.

AB  - Predicting tree phenology accurately is essential for assessing the impact of climate change on ecosystems. However, the current process-based models are still hard to fully explain and quantify the effects of multiple biotic and environmental factors (e.g., spring phenology, local adaptation, productivity, climatic variables) on autumn phenology. Using leaf senescence data (1980-2015) of 232766 site-year records (3020 sites and 6 deciduous tree species) in Europe, we first calibrated and evaluated 4 process-based models developed by previous studies. Subsequently, by using different machine learning (ML) algorithms (RF, EBM, and GAMI-Net), we developed 3 ML-based models for predicting the leaf senescence date of the same species and quantifying the importance and response function of 63 biotic or environmental variables. We found that the root mean square error (RMSE) of process-based models (averaged from all species) for the test dataset ranged from 11.97 to 12.91 days. The ML-based models outperformed process-based models for all species, with RMSE ranging from 10.01 to 10.58 days. For most species, the recently developed ML algorithms (EBM and GAMI-Net) are more effective than the classical RF algorithm developed in the early 21th century. Besides the temperature and photoperiod in autumn, the geographic factors (especially elevation, longitude, and latitude) were identified as the most important variables in the ML-based models, implying that leaf senescence date is an adaptive trait. Furthermore, for most species investigated, earlier leaf-out dates tended to advance the leaf senescence date. Our results highlight that the ML algorithms not only could effectively improve the performance of the process-based models for predicting the leaf senescence date, but also help to understand the nonlinear and interactive effects of multiple driving factors on autumn phenology.

AB  - Globally, lung and colon cancers are among the most prevalent and lethal tumors. Early cancer identification is essential to increase the likelihood of survival. Histopathological images are considered an appropriate tool for diagnosing cancer, which is tedious and error-prone if done manually. Recently, machine learning methods based on feature engineering have gained prominence in automatic histopathological image classification. Furthermore, these methods are more interpretable than deep learning, which operates in a "black box" manner. In the medical profession, the interpretability of a technique is critical to gaining the trust of end users to adopt it. In view of the above, this work aims to create an accurate and interpretable machine-learning technique for the automated classification of lung and colon cancers from histopathology images. In the proposed approach, following the preprocessing steps, texture and color features are retrieved by utilizing the Haralick and Color histogram feature extraction algorithms, respectively. The obtained features are concatenated to form a single feature set. The three feature sets (texture, color, and combined features) are passed into the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) classifier for classification. And their performance is evaluated on the LC25000 dataset using hold-out and stratified 10-fold cross-validation (Stratified 10-FCV) techniques. With a test/hold-out set, the LightGBM with texture, color, and combined features classifies the lung and colon cancer images with 97.72%, 99.92%, and 100% accuracy respectively. In addition, a stratified 10-fold cross-validation method also revealed that LightGBM's combined or color features performed well, with an excellent mean auc_mu score and a low mean multi_logloss value. Thus, this proposed technique can help histologists detect and classify lung and colon histopathology images more efficiently, effectively, and economically, resulting in more productivity.

AB  - Dryland vegetation plays a pivotal role in the global ecosystem and is extraordinarily sensitive to water pulses, yet it is experiencing increasingly severe flooding. Floods have both significant beneficial and detrimental effects that may trigger extreme positive or negative responses in dryland vegetation compared to non-flooded areas, a phenomenon we call polarization, which threatens the stability of ecosystems. However, the characters and drivers of the polarized responses of dryland vegetation to spring floods remain unclear. Taking Central Asia-a typical and important dryland region-as a case, this study developed a Vegetation Response Index (VRI) and a threshold-based Polarization Index (PI) based on satellite remote sensing, and then integrated interpretable machine learning to investigate the drivers of vegetation polarization responses. The results indicate that vegetation in flood-affected areas exhibited much stronger positive and negative VRI compared to non-flooded areas, with an average of 28.6 % (positive) and 25.8 % (negative) of the pixels exceeding the polarization threshold. This polarization phenomenon was validated using two different vegetation indices (EVI and LAI) based on polarization magnitude, event occurrence rate, and consistency, all providing strong evidence for the polarized growth patterns of dryland vegetation after spring floods. The influencing factors have high interpretability for both positive and negative polarization (88.8 % and 90.2 % accuracy), with climatic factors being the determinant of whether polarization occurs. The key factors present three patterns of effect on polarization: intersection, threshold and range. These patterns characterize the environmental and climate conditions most likely to lead to polarization, explaining why some plants were able to adapt to flooding while others are succumbed. This study identifies and analyzes the polarized response of dryland vegetation to floods, providing vital insights for predicting and managing ecosystem vulnerability amidst increasing flood events.

AB  - Droughts have posed intense threats to the forest carbon sink (i.e. net ecosystem productivity, NEP), potentially elevating the risk of forest degradation and challenging the achievement of climatic and ecological goals. While global forest NEP endured, the resilience of NEP served as the ability of ecosystems to withstand and recover from perturbations and the underlying maintenance mechanisms during droughts remain unclear. Here, we explored the responses of NEP resilience, quantified by the lag-1 temporal autocorrelation coefficient (TAC) of two consecutive time series, to droughts based on 87 drought events across 45 forest sites with flux and meteorological observations in the Northern Hemisphere. Furthermore, an interpretable machine learning algorithm was utilized to disentangle the synergistic effects of environmental and biotic factors on TAC, achieving a mean coefficient of determination of 0.87 for drought events with significantly increasing TAC and 0.91 for other drought events. Here, we found that the increase in NEP resilience could alleviate the negative effects of droughts, in contrast to a 2.5 times increase in the probability of NEP decline events associated with decreased NEP resilience. However, NEP resilience declined with the rise of drought intensification. The reduced reference canopy conductance (Gcref) was the primary constraint on NEP resilience maintenance, contributing 48% to the total influence of biotic factors. In addition, high vapor pressure deficit (VPD) exacerbated the negative effects of soil moisture deficit, jointly leading to the decline in NEP resilience. Specifically, elevated VPD during droughts significantly reduced Gcref, indicating the vulnerability of tree hydraulic systems to compound stress. Overall, our study emphasizes the potential risks of the compound soil and atmospheric water deficit on forest NEP resilience and carbon sink across the Northern Hemisphere in the future.

AB  - Background: Computer-assisted clinical coding (CAC) based on automated coding algorithms has been expected to improve the International Classification of Disease, tenth version (ICD-10) coding quality and productivity, whereas studies oriented to primary diagnosis auto-coding are limited in the Chinese context. Objective: This study aims at developing a machine learning (ML) model for automated primary diagnosis ICD-10 coding. Methods: A total of 71,709 admissions in Fuwai hospital were included to carry out this study, corresponding to 168 primary diagnosis ICD-10 codes. Based on clinical implications, two feature engineering methods were used to process discharge diagnosis and procedure texts into sequential features and sequential grouping features respectively by which two kinds of models were built and compared. One baseline model using one-hot encoding features was considered. Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) was adopted as the classifier, and grid search and cross-validation were used to select the optimal hyperparameters. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values were applied to give the interpretability of models. Results: Our best prediction model was developed based on sequential grouping features. It showed good performance in the test phase with accuracy and macro-averaged F1 (Macro-F1) of 95.2% and 88.3% respectively. The comparison of the models demonstrated the effectiveness of the sequential information and the grouping strategy in boosting model performance (P-value < 0.01). Subgroup analysis of the best model on each individual code manifested that 91.1% of the codes achieved the F1 over 70.0%. Conclusions: Our model has been demonstrated its effectiveness for automated primary diagnosis coding in the Chinese context and its results are interpretable. Hence, it has the potential to assist clinical coders to improve coding efficiency and quality in Chinese inpatient settings.

AB  - Inhaled dose is crucial for accurately assessing exposure to air pollution, determined by pollutant concentration and minute ventilation (VE). However, the VE predictive models and its application to assess the health effects of air pollution are still lacking. In this study, we developed VE predictive models using machine learning techniques, utilizing data obtained from eighty participants who underwent a laboratory cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). VE predictive models were developed using generalized additive model (GAM), random forest model (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and analyzed for explanation of input variables. The Random Forest model, cross-validated, exhibited outstanding performance with an R-2 of 0.986 and a MAE of 1.816 L/min. The median difference between the measured VE and the predicted VE was 0.18 L/min, and the median difference between the black carbon (BC) inhaled dose based on predicted VE and measured VE was 0.02 ng. Employing explainable machine learning, the results showed that metabolic equivalent (METs), heart rate, and body weight are the three top important variables, emphasizing the significance of incorporating METs variables when constructing VE models. Through multiple linear regression models and an adjusted stratified analysis model, the significant adverse association between BC concentration and inhaled dose on diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was only observed in female. The disparity in the effect of BC inhaled dose compared to BC concentration on DBP reached up to 115%. This study is the first to explore the ability of different machine learning algorithms to construct VE prediction models and directly apply the models to assess health effects of an example pollutant. This study contributes to the accurate assessment of air pollution exposure leveraging wearable devices, an approach useful for environmental epidemiology studies.

AB  - Background:Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease characterized by muscle weakness and fatigability. The fluctuating nature of the disease course impedes the clinical management. Objective:The purpose of the study was to establish and validate a machine learning (ML)-based model for predicting the short-term clinical outcome in MG patients with different antibody types. Methods:We studied 890 MG patients who had regular follow-ups at 11 tertiary centers in China from 1 January 2015 to 31 July 2021 (653 patients for derivation and 237 for validation). The short-term outcome was the modified post-intervention status (PIS) at a 6-month visit. A two-step variable screening was used to determine the factors for model construction and 14 ML algorithms were used for model optimisation. Results:The derivation cohort included 653 patients from Huashan hospital [age 44.24 (17.22) years, female 57.6%, generalized MG 73.5%], and the validation cohort included 237 patients from 10 independent centers [age 44.24 (17.22) years, female 55.0%, generalized MG 81.2%]. The ML model identified patients who were improved with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.91 [0.89-0.93], 'Unchanged' 0.89 [0.87-0.91], and 'Worse' 0.89 [0.85-0.92] in the derivation cohort, whereas identified patients who were improved with an AUC of 0.84 [0.79-0.89], 'Unchanged' 0.74 [0.67-0.82], and 'Worse' 0.79 [0.70-0.88] in the validation cohort. Both datasets presented a good calibration ability by fitting the expectation slopes. The model is finally explained by 25 simple predictors and transferred to a feasible web tool for an initial assessment. Conclusion:The explainable, ML-based predictive model can aid in forecasting the short-term outcome for MG with good accuracy in clinical practice.

AB  - This study focuses on the Dongting Lake region in China and evaluates ecological vulnerability using the Sensitivity-Resilience-Pressure (SRP) framework, integrated with Spatial Principal Component Analysis (SPCA) to calculate the Ecological Vulnerability Index (EVI). The EVI values were classified into five levels using the Natural Breaks (Jenks) method, and spatial autocorrelation analysis was applied to reveal spatial differentiation patterns. The Geodetector model was used to analyze the driving mechanisms of natural and socioeconomic factors on EVI, identifying key influencing variables. Furthermore, the LightGBM algorithm was used for feature optimization, followed by the construction of six machine learning models-Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Extremely Randomized Trees (ET), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), LightGBM, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)-to conduct multi-class classification of ecological vulnerability. Model performance was assessed using ROC-AUC, accuracy, recall, confusion matrix, and Kappa coefficient, and the best-performing model was interpreted using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). The results indicate that: (1) ecological vulnerability increased progressively from the core wetlands and riparian corridors to the transitional zones in the surrounding hills and mountains; (2) a significant spatial clustering of ecological vulnerability was observed, with a Moran's I index of 0.78; (3) Geodetector analysis identified the interaction between NPP (q = 0.329) and precipitation (PRE, q = 0.268) as the dominant factor (q = 0.50) influencing spatial variation of EVI; (4) the Random Forest model achieved the best classification performance (AUC = 0.954, F1 score = 0.78), and SHAP analysis showed that NPP and PRE made the most significant contributions to model predictions. This study proposes a multi-method integrated decision support framework for assessing ecological vulnerability in lake wetland ecosystems.

AB  - The adoption of sustainable solutions in soil stabilization has piqued the interest of the scientific community due to the potential reduction in carbon footprint. In this regard, the research community has started looking for the alternate sustainable solutions to limit the quantity of conventionally used ecologically unfriendly soil stabilizers like lime and cement by utilizing the agricultural and industrial by-products. The production of conventional soil stabilizers (lime and cement) is extremely energy-intensive and contributes tons of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. In general, evaluating suitability of these additives requires in-lab investigation of soil samples with varying additive concentrations and curing periods, making this approach both resource and time-intensive. Hence, this article proposes a computational framework for accelerated characterization of soil-stabilization by using the coupled experimental-Gaussian process (GP) based machine learning (ML) model. The dataset utilized for constructing the GP models consists of input features such as the stabilizer content (lime and rice husk ash (RHA)), coir fiber content, and curing period (measured in days). The target responses are the strength measures of the stabilized soil, such as unconfined compressive strength (UCS), split tensile strength (STS), and California bearing ratio (CBR). The proposed computational framework is deployed to perform multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA)-based optimization to achieve maximum engineering performance from stabilized soil. The presented study demonstrated that with the optimal dosage of rice husk ash (agricultural by-product), and cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL) treated coir fiber, the requirement for lime dosage may be significantly reduced while maintaining the engineering performance of the soil. The presented computational framework can be extended to any construction practices for ensuring the strategic selection of the control variables for optimizing the desired performance.

TI  - Formulation of Feature and Label Space Using Modified Delphi in Support of Developing a Machine-Learning Algorithm to Automate Clash Resolution

KW  - KNOWLEDGE
KW  - COORDINATION
AB  - To improve the current manual and iterative nature of clash resolution on construction projects, current research efforts continue to explore and test the utilization of machine-learning algorithms to automate the process. Though current research shows significant accuracy in automating clash resolution, many have failed to provide clear explanation and justification for the selection of their feature and label space. Since this is critical in developing an effective and explainable solution in machine learning, it is crucial to address this research gap. In this paper, the authors utilize an in-depth literature review and industry interviews to capture domain knowledge on how design clashes are resolved by industry experts. From analysis of the knowledge captured, we identified 23 factors considered by experts when resolving clashes and five alternative solutions/options to resolve a clash. Using a pool of industry experts, a modified Delphi approach was conducted to validate the factors and options and to determine a priority ranking. The authors identified 94 industry experts based on a predetermined qualification matrix to take part in the modified Delphi. Twelve participants responded and took part in the first round, and 11 completed the second round. A consensus was reached on all clash factors and resolution options. Factors including "clashing elements type," "constrained slope," "critical element in the clash," "location of the clash," "code compliance," and "project stage clashing element is in" were ranked as the most important factors, while "clashing element material" and "insulation type" were considered the least important. Participants also showed more preference to the "moving the clashing element with low priority in/along x-y-z directions" option to resolve clashes. These identified factors and options will be utilized to collect specific clash data to train and test effective and explainable machine-learning algorithms toward automating clash resolution.

AB  - Data are most important for any manufacturing processes in decision-making. It is important to monitor this data to improve the productivity of processes. Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is a very effective tool for capturing process information. This work focus on implement of IIoT in TIG welding processes. We developed an IIoT-enabled TIG welding setup that tracks key parameters like current, travel speed, gas flow rate, and arc gap in real time. This data is sent to a cloud platform and displayed through an easy-to-use mobile app, giving welders and engineers clear visibility into the process. This work also explore the potential application of IIoT in inspection to improve the inspection process. By capturing and processing weld images, we could measure bead width and detect any visible surface defects using edge detection and contour analysis. Also, Mobile based application is developed to store the inspection results of LPT, UT and metallography for proper documentation and analysis. The implementation of machine learning using XGBoost algorithm is discussed to predict the mechanical properties like, Ultimate tensile strength and hardness of HAZ and weld. The model performed very well, achieving over 95% accuracy, and was further explained using SHAP tools so we could understand not just what the model predicted, but why. For example, we could see how changing travel speed or gas flow affected the final weld quality. In short, this work demonstrates how combining IIoT, machine learning, and image processing can make TIG welding smarter, more reliable, and easier to control. It turns raw.

AB  - Self-Explaining Autonomous Systems (SEAS) have emerged as a strategic frontier within Artificial Intelligence (AI), responding to growing demands for transparency and interpretability in autonomous decision-making. This study presents a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of SEAS research published between 2020 and February 2025, drawing upon 1380 documents indexed in Scopus. The analysis applies co-citation mapping, keyword co-occurrence, and author collaboration networks using VOSviewer, MASHA, and Python to examine scientific production, intellectual structure, and global collaboration patterns. The results indicate a sustained annual growth rate of 41.38%, with an h-index of 57 and an average of 21.97 citations per document. A normalized citation rate was computed to address temporal bias, enabling balanced evaluation across publication cohorts. Thematic analysis reveals four consolidated research fronts: interpretability in machine learning, explainability in deep neural networks, transparency in generative models, and optimization strategies in autonomous control. Author co-citation analysis identifies four distinct research communities, and keyword evolution shows growing interdisciplinary links with medicine, cybersecurity, and industrial automation. The United States leads in scientific output and citation impact at the geographical level, while countries like India and China show high productivity with varied influence. However, international collaboration remains limited at 7.39%, reflecting a fragmented research landscape. As discussed in this study, SEAS research is expanding rapidly yet remains epistemologically dispersed, with uneven integration of ethical and human-centered perspectives. This work offers a structured and data-driven perspective on SEAS development, highlights key contributors and thematic trends, and outlines critical directions for advancing responsible and transparent autonomous systems.

AB  - Plant diseases significantly impact crop productivity and quality, posing a serious threat to global agriculture. The process of identifying and categorizing these diseases is often time-consuming and prone to errors. This research addresses this issue by employing a convolutional neural network and support vector machine (CNN-SVM) hybrid model to classify diseases in four economically important crops: strawberries, peaches, cherries, and soybeans. The objective is to categorize 10 classes of diseases, with six diseased classes and four healthy classes, for these crops using the deep learning-based CNN-SVM model. Several pre-trained models, including VGG16, VGG19, DenseNet, Inception, MobileNetV2, MobileNet, Xception, and ShuffleNet, were also trained, achieving accuracy ranges from 53.82% to 98.8%. The proposed model, however, achieved an average accuracy of 99.09%. While the proposed model's accuracy is comparable to that of the VGG16 pre-trained model, its significantly lower number of trainable parameters makes it more efficient and distinctive. This research demonstrates the potential of the CNN-SVM model in enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of plant disease classification. The CNN-SVM model was selected over VGG16 and other models due to its superior performance metrics. The proposed model achieved a 99% F1-score, a 99.98% Area Under the Curve (AUC), and a 99% precision value, demonstrating its efficacy. Additionally, class activation maps were generated using the Gradient Weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) technique to provide a visual explanation of the detected diseases. A heatmap was created to highlight the regions requiring classification, further validating the model's accuracy and interpretability.

AB  - This paper presents a deep-learning-based system for classifying pig postures, aiming to improve the management of sustainable smart pigsties. The classification of pig postures is a crucial concern for researchers investigating pigsty environments and for on-site pigsty managers. To address this issue, we developed a comprehensive system framework for pig posture classification within a pigsty. We collected image datasets from an open data sharing site operated by a public organization and systematically conducted the following steps: object detection, data labeling, image preprocessing, model development, and training. These processes were carried out using the acquired datasets to ensure comprehensive and effective training for our pig posture classification system. Subsequently, we analyzed and discussed the classification results using techniques such as Grad-CAM. As a result of visual analysis through Grad-CAM, it is possible to identify image features when posture is correctly classified or misclassified in a pig image. By referring to these results, it is expected that the accuracy of pig posture classification can be further improved. Through this analysis and discussion, we can identify which features of pig postures in images need to be emphasized to improve the accuracy of pig posture classification. The findings of this study are anticipated to significantly improve the accuracy of pig posture classification. In practical applications, the proposed pig posture classification system holds the potential to promptly detect abnormal situations in pigsties, leading to prompt responses. Ultimately, this can greatly contribute to increased productivity in pigsty operations, fostering efficiency enhancements in pigsty management.

AB  - Kawasaki disease (KD) is a leading cause of acquired coronary vasculitis in children and remains a critical diagnostic challenge among febrile pediatric patients. To support frontline pediatricians with a more objective diagnostic tool, we developed and implemented KDpredictor, a machine learning-based model for KD risk identification. KDpredictor leverages only the routine blood test features, including complete blood count with differential count, C-reactive protein, and alanine aminotransferase. It also takes the lead in using age-calibrated eosinophil, platelet, and hemoglobin results. Trained using the light gradient boosting machine algorithm on clinical data from 1,927 KD cases and 45,274 febrile controls, KDpredictor achieved strong performance metrics (auROC: 95.7%, auPRC: 72.4%, recall: 0.89) on a reserved test set, outperforming previous models by at least 3% in auROC and 39.3% in auPRC. Additional explainable AI analyses revealed that several top predictive features in KDpredictor are consistent with prior clinical findings. We also evaluated KDpredictor on three independent cohorts collected in East Asia (Taiwan and China) during the COVID-19 period. KDpredictor achieves recall values of 90.9%, 83.7%, and 91.7% on KD samples identified in three independent medical centers, respectively, indicating its applicability across independent clinical settings. In summary, KDpredictor demonstrates robust generalizability in KD risk identification across populations by using only standard blood samples independent of clinical symptoms.

T2  - HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS
LA  - English
AB  - This study investigates the impact of media on color sense: our ability to see different colors and use them to interpret the world. Specifically, we examine the role of color in the cultural construction of the Orient-an 'imagined geography' used to justify colonial domination-in two turn-of-the-twentieth-century types of color(ed) photographs: photochromes, where a printer added color, and autochromes, where colors were captured during exposure. While most research on visual Orientalism has focused on content, we use machine learning methods to study the most important formal element of visual Orientalism: color. After using K-means clustering to extract sixteen dominant colors from each photograph in our dataset, we train three different random forest classification algorithms to make a distinction between (A) the two color media (B) photochromes of the Orient and the Occident; and (C) autochromes of the Orient and the Occident. Subsequently, we apply Shapley Additive Explanations, an explainable AI method, to interpret the output of the classifiers. This allows us to examine how specific features (colors) impacted the classifiers' predictions. While the algorithm can easily separate photochromes from autochromes (0.95) and Oriental from Occidental photochromes (0.93), it struggles with the same task in the autochrome collection (0.68). These findings support three interconnected conclusions: (1) color sense became mediated in the late nineteenth century, (2) in photochromes, the presence and absence of specific colors was a vital aspect of visual Orientalism, (3) the autochrome, where color was derived from light, provided a more objective picture of countries in the near and middle East than the photochrome.

AB  - Objectives: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition which is responsible for a high proportion of intrahospital deaths and related healthcare costs each year. Early detection and treatment of sepsis episodes is critical, since an early treatment may highly improve prognosis. This study proposed an original method to increase the interpretability of a set of machine learning models for the early detection of sepsis onset.
   Material and methods: Open data from the electronic medical records of 40,336 patients monitored in intensive care units (ICU), provided by the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2019 is used in this paper. We proposed a method including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model construction and tuning, as well as an original interpretability analysis method for the final stage.
   Results: A total of 24 models were developed and analyzed. The best model, based on 142 features achieved a 0.4274 utility score. The best compact model integrates only 20 selected features, and provided a utility score of 0.3862. Meanwhile, the proposed sensitivity analysis method allows for the identification of the most relevant markers to early detect the onset of sepsis, as well as their interdependence and relative importance on the final decision.
   Conclusion: A set of optimized machine-learning models were proposed for predicting sepsis early in a real-time way with high performance, and interpretable information including the most significant biomarkers were analyzed through novel interpretability method.

AB  - The construction of accurate and interpretable predictive model for high abundance fishing ground is conducive to better sustainable fisheries production and carbon reduction. This article used refined statistical maps to visualize the spatial and temporal patterns of catch changes based on the 2014-2021 fishery statistics of the Japanese sardine Sardinops melanostictus fishery in the Northwest Pacific Ocean. Three models (XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost) and two variable importance visualization methods (model built-in (split) and SHAP methods) were used for comparative analysis to determine the optimal modeling and visualization strategies. Results: 1) From 2014 to 2021, the annual catch showed an overall increasing trend and peaked at 220,009.063 tons in 2021; the total monthly catch increased and then decreased, with a peak of 76, 033.4944 tons (July), and the catch was mainly concentrated in the regions of 39.5 degrees-43 degrees N and 146.75 degrees-155.75 degrees E; 2) Catboost model predicted better than LightGBM and XGBoost models, with the highest values of accuracy and F1-score, 73.8% and 75.31%, respectively; 3) the overall importance ranking of the model's built-in method differed significantly from that in the SHAP method, and the overall importance ranking of the spatial variables in the SHAP method increased. Compared to the built-in method, the SHAP method informs the magnitude and direction of the influence of each variable at the global and local levels. The results of the research help us to select the optimal model and the optimal visualization method to construct a prediction model for the Japanese sardine fishing grounds in the Northwest Pacific Ocean, which will provide a scientific basis for the Japanese sardine fishery to achieve environmental and economically sustainable fishery development.

AB  - Data -driven constitutive modeling with neural networks has received increased interest in recent years due to its ability to easily incorporate physical and mechanistic constraints and to overcome the challenging and time-consuming task of formulating phenomenological constitutive laws that can accurately capture the observed material response. However, even though neural network -based constitutive laws have been shown to generalize proficiently, the generated representations are not easily interpretable due to their high number of trainable parameters. Sparse regression approaches exist that allow for obtaining interpretable expressions, but the user is tasked with creating a library of model forms which by construction limits their expressiveness to the functional forms provided in the libraries. In this work, we propose to train regularized physics -augmented neural network -based constitutive models utilizing a smoothed version of L 0 -regularization. This aims to maintain the trustworthiness inherited by the physical constraints, but also enables interpretability which has not been possible thus far on any type of machine learning -based constitutive model where model forms were not assumed a priori but were actually discovered. During the training process, the network simultaneously fits the training data and penalizes the number of active parameters, while also ensuring constitutive constraints such as thermodynamic consistency. We show that the method can reliably obtain interpretable and trustworthy constitutive models for compressible and incompressible hyperelasticity, yield functions, and hardening models for elastoplasticity, using synthetic and experimental data. This work aims to set a new paradigm for interpretable machine learning models in the broad area of solid mechanics where low and limited data is available along with prior knowledge of physical constraints that the learned maps need to obey. This paradigm can potentially be extended to a broader spectrum of scientific exploration.

AB  - Arid and semi-arid regions serve as crucial ecological barriers in China, making the spatiotemporal evolution of their ecological environmental quality (EEQ) scientifically significant. This study developed a Modified Remote Sensing Ecological Index (MRSEI) by innovatively integrating the Comprehensive Salinity Indicator (CSI) into the Remote Sensing Ecological Index (RSEI) and applied it to systematically evaluate the spatiotemporal evolution of EEQ (2014-2023) in Yinchuan City, a typical arid region of northwest China along the upper Yellow River. The study revealed the spatiotemporal evolution patterns through the Theil-Sen (T-S) estimator and Mann-Kendall (M-K) test, and adopted the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) combined with the Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) to quantify the contributions of ten natural and anthropogenic driving factors. The results suggest that (1) the MRSEI outperformed the RSEI, showing 0.41% higher entropy and 5.63% greater contrast, better characterizing the arid region's heterogeneity. (2) The EEQ showed marked spatial heterogeneity. High-quality areas are concentrated in the Helan Mountains and the integrated urban/rural development demonstration zone, while the core functional zone of the provincial capital, the Helan Mountains ecological corridor, and the eastern eco-economic pilot zone showed lower EEQ. (3) A total of 87.92% of the area (7609.23 km2) remained stable with no significant changes. Notably, degraded areas (934.52 km2, 10.80%) exceeded improved zones (111.04 km2, 1.28%), demonstrating an overall ecological deterioration trend. (4) This study applied LightGBM with SHAP to analyze the driving factors of EEQ. The results demonstrated that Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) was the predominant driver, contributing 41.52%, followed by the Digital Elevation Model (DEM, 18.26%) and Net Primary Productivity (NPP, 12.63%). This study offers a novel framework for arid ecological monitoring, supporting evidence-based conservation and sustainable development in the Yellow River Basin.

AB  - With the development of green, low-carbon, and sustainable economic systems, the issues of high pollution and energy consumption in construction materials have become increasingly prominent. This study focuses on adopting one-part geopolymer (OPG) in soil stabilization for underground engineering, which exhibits environmental and low-carbon advantages. The unconfined compressive strength (UCS) serves as a crucial parameter for assessing stabilized soil's performance. However, it is necessary to conduct a large number of experiments, inducing high costs and time consumption. In this study, one multiple linear regression model, one Decision Tree (DT) model, five ensemble machine learning (ML) models (i.e. Random Forest [RF], Extra Tree [ET], Gradient Boosting [GB], Gradient Boosting Decision Tree [GBDT], and Extreme Gradient Boosting [XGBoost]), and hybrid models of those single ensemble models with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) (i.e. PSO-RF, PSO-ET, PSO-GB, PSO-GBDT, and PSO-XGBoost) were adopted and compared to achieve better prediction on the UCS of the OPG-stabilized soil. Furthermore, the interpretable method including SHAP and PDP (1D and 2D), was employed to investigate the precise mechanisms by which input parameters influenced the output label. The results revealed that the multiple linear regression model delivered the lowest accuracy, and PSO-XGBoost and PSO-ET exhibited the best performance on the prediction of the UCS with R2 value of 0.9964 and 0.9928, respectively. In addition, Curing time exerted the most significant impact on the UCS, followed by FA/GGBFS, Molarity, Water/Binder, and NaOH/Precursor. Compared to the SHAP method, the PDP offered a more intuitive approach to reveal the relationship between the inputs and output. The outcome of the study shed new light on the application of ML models in the prediction of the OPG-stabilized soil's performance in underground engineering.

AB  - The western North Pacific subtropical high (WNPSH) is a critical atmospheric circulation system influencing weather and climate patterns in eastern China. Accurately predicting its activity is essential for anticipating and managing natural disasters such as droughts and floods in the region. In this study, we employ the decision tree (DT) as the fundamental model and devise a compatible framework to create an integrated model known as the Decision Tree Integration Model for Synthesizing Multiple External Forcing Signals (DTI-MS), to perform classification prediction of the WNPSH ridge line in summer. Within the construction of DTI-MS, the interpretability advantage of DT model is fully exploited. Three significant sources of external forcing signals, namely sea surface temperature in the Pacific, Tropical Indian Ocean and Atlantic Ocean, and snow depth across the Eurasian continent, are identified from distinct DT models, with clear physical meanings. Through the voting strategy, these signals are integrated, laying the groundwork for DTI-MS to synthesize multiple external forcing signals. Regarding prediction performance, DTI-MS achieves a high classification accuracy of 91% in the training set and 93% in the testing set, with recalls for the southerly and northerly positions of the WNPSH in the testing set also exceeding 80%. Compared with the commonly used machine learning models such as DT and Random Forests constructed through general modeling approaches, DTI-MS also demonstrates higher classification accuracy. Overall, DTI-MS not only shows promising potential in predicting the WNPSH ridge line, but its integration framework also provides a new paradigm for short-term climate prediction modeling.

AB  - The construction sector is a major contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions. Using recycled and waste materials in concrete is a practical solution to address environmental challenges. Currently, agricultural waste is widely used as a substitute for cement in the production of ecofriendly concrete. However, traditional methods for assessing the strength of such materials are both expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, this study uses machine learning techniques to develop prediction models for the compressive strength (CS) of rice husk ash (RHA) concrete. The ML techniques used in the present study include random forest (RF), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), ridge regression, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). A total of 348 values of CS were collected from the experimental studies, and five characteristics of RHA concrete were taken as input variables. For the performance assessment of the models, multiple statistical metrics were used. During the training phase, the correlation coefficients (R) obtained for ridge regression, RF, XGBoost, and LightGBM were 0.943, 0.981, 0.985, and 0.996, respectively. In the testing set, the developed models demonstrated even higher performance, with correlation coefficients of 0.971, 0.993, 0.992, and 0.998 for ridge regression, RF, XGBoost, and LightGBM, respectively. The statistical analysis revealed that the LightGBM model outperformed other models, whereas the ridge regression model exhibited comparatively lower accuracy. SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method was employed for the interpretability of the developed model. The SHAP analysis revealed that water-to-cement is a controlling parameter in estimating the CS of RHA concrete. In conclusion, this study provides valuable guidance for builders and researchers to estimate the CS of RHA concrete. However, it is suggested that more

AB  - Background Premature rupture of membranes (PROM) poses significant risks to both maternal and neonatal health. This study aims to construct a risk factor prediction model related to PROM by using machine learning technology and explore the association with nutritional inflammatory index.Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients with PROM. Based on the variables screened out by ridge regression and Boruta algorithm, univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were further adopted. According to the sample data, it is divided into the training set and the internal validation set in a ratio of 7:3. The research group adopted four machine learning algorithms: Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), and Random Forest (RF). The selected variables were incorporated into model construction, with the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) serving as a criterion for model selection. Model performance was assessed using AUC values, sensitivity, specificity, recall, F1 score, and accuracy. The variables were selected based on the contribution degree of the variables in Shapley additive Interpretation (SHAP) to construct the nomogram.Results A retrospective analysis was conducted involving 800 parturients at Binhai County People's Hospital from January 2023 to October 2024, comprising 400 with PROM and 400 with normal delivery. The RF model demonstrated superior performance with an AUC of 0.757, sensitivity of 67.4%, and specificity of 65.1%. Key predictive factors identified included body mass index (BMI), prognostic nutritional index (PNI), platelet, albumin, and aggregate index of systemic inflammation (AISI). The ROC of the model also showed good efficacy, with an AUC of 0.777.Conclusion This study highlights the potential of machine learning in enhancing the understanding and prediction of PROM, and emphasizes the significance of inflammatory and nutritional indicators, paving the way for future research in maternal-fetal medicine.

AB  - Self-Compacting Concrete (SCC) has gained significant popularity due to its exceptional workability performance. However, designing SCC poses more challenges than ordinary concrete, as it must fulfill requirements for filling ability, passing ability, and segregation resistance. Regrettably, existing test techniques lack the ability to simultaneously evaluate all these properties, and relying on experiential knowledge and cognition without tangible physical meaning. Although rheology examines the flow and deformation of fluid materials and is closely related to SCC's properties, the relationship between SCC composition, rheology, and properties remains unclear due to the complexity of the factors involved and the absence of effective tools. This study introduces a novel approach by utilizing a random forest algorithm to create multiple interpretable machine learning models for predicting the rheology, workability, and mechanical properties of SCC. Additionally, SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) and Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) methods were integrated with the models to analyze how SCC composition impacts its properties by altering the rheology of the mixture. The models exhibit high accuracy in predicting both rheology and SCC properties (R2 = 0.93 - 0.98, Index of Agreement = 0.92 - 0.99). According to the SHAP and PDP analysis, yield stress and plastic viscosity were negatively correlated with slump flow, L-box ratio, and segregation rate, while exhibiting a positive correlation with V-funnel time and strength. Furthermore, the dependence of the segregation rate on yield stress was observed to be stronger at relatively low yield stress levels (below 40 Pa). These models provide valuable insights for designing and evaluating SCC mixtures tailored to specific requirements. Additionally, the study explores underlying mechanisms and offers guidelines for proportioning SCC in different design scenarios. The findings contribute to the advancement of SCC technology and have significant implications for the construction industry.

AB  - Compressive strength is an important mechanical index that determines the mixture design of geopolymer, and its accurate prediction is essential. The existing experiment-based and statistical methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive and inaccurate. This study aims to develop an effective, reliable and interpretable machine learning (ML) model for predicting the compressive strength of calcium-based geopolymers. Feature engineering was constructed with molar ratios of raw material oxide composition, curing system, and mixing design. A total of eight algorithms in three types, traditional ML algorithms, integrated tree-based ML algorithms, and deep neural network algorithm, were employed to predict the compressive strength, and their differences, advantages, and disadvantages were compared. The importance of input variables in model training was evaluated. The contribution and influence pattern of input features on the development of compressive strength were revealed using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and inverse prediction. The results demonstrate that among the eight models proposed, the XGB model had the highest prediction accuracy (91%) and the lowest root mean squared error (3.85 MPa). Based on the importance analysis and the SHAP value, the parameters that had the greatest impact on the compressive strength were curing age, n(H2O)/n(Na2O), curing temperature, n(SiO2)/n (CaO) and the mass ratio of alkali activation solution to solid powder (L/S). The effects of input features on the compressive strength development of calcium-based geopolymers captured by SHAP and inverse predictions based on the best predictive model were consistent with the experimental results and theoretical understanding. The research in this paper facilitates the rapid prediction, improvement and optimization of the proportioning design and application of calcium-based geopolymers, and also provides a theoretical basis for the utilization of industrial and construction waste, in line with sustainable and low-carbon development strategies.

AB  - Introduction Urban green space (GS) exposure is recognized as a nature-based strategy for addressing urban challenges. However, the stress relieving effects and mechanisms of GS exposure are yet to be fully explored. The development of machine learning and street view images offers a method for large-scale measurement and precise empirical analysis.Methods This study focuses on the central area of Shanghai, examining the complex effects of GS exposure on psychological stress perception. By constructing a multidimensional psychological stress perception scale and integrating machine learning algorithms with extensive street view images data, we successfully developed a framework for measuring urban stress perception. Using the scores from the psychological stress perception scale provided by volunteers as labeled data, we predicted the psychological stress perception in Shanghai's central urban area through the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. Additionally, this study employed the interpretable machine learning model eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm to reveal the nonlinear relationship between GS exposure and residents' psychological stress.Results Results indicate that the GS exposure in central Shanghai is generally low, with significant spatial heterogeneity. GS exposure has a positive impact on reducing residents' psychological stress. However, this effect has a threshold; when GS exposure exceeds 0.35, its impact on stress perception gradually diminishes.Discussion We recommend combining the threshold of stress perception with GS exposure to identify urban spaces, thereby guiding precise strategies for enhancing GS. This research not only demonstrates the complex mitigating effect of GS exposure on psychological stress perception but also emphasizes the importance of considering the "dose-effect" of it in urban planning and construction. Based on open-source data, the framework and methods developed in this study have the potential to be applied in different urban environments, thus providing more comprehensive support for future urban planning.

AB  - ObjectiveDistant metastasis of thyroid cancer often indicates poor prognosis, and it is important to identify patients who have developed distant metastasis or are at high risk as early as possible. This paper aimed to predict distant metastasis of thyroid cancer through the construction of machine learning models to provide a reference for clinical diagnosis and treatment.Materials & methodsData on demographic and clinicopathological characteristics of thyroid cancer patients between 2010 and 2015 were extracted from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Our research used univariate and multivariate logistic models to screen independent risk factors, respectively. Decision Trees (DT), ElasticNet (ENET), Logistic Regression (LR), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Radial Basis Function Support Vector Machine (RBFSVM) and seven machine learning models were compared and evaluated by the following metrics: the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration curve, decision curve analysis (DCA), sensitivity(also called recall), specificity, precision, accuracy and F1 score. Interpretable machine learning was used to identify possible correlation between variables and distant metastasis.ResultsIndependent risk factors for distant metastasis, including age, gender, race, marital status, histological type, capsular invasion, and number of lymph nodes metastases were screened by multifactorial regression analysis. Among the seven machine learning algorithms, RF was the best algorithm, with an AUC of 0.948, sensitivity of 0.919, accuracy of 0.845, and F1 score of 0.886 in the training set, and an AUC of 0.960, sensitivity of 0.929, accuracy of 0.906, and F1 score of 0.908 in the test set.ConclusionsThe machine learning model constructed in this study helps in the early diagnosis of distant thyroid metastases and helps physicians to make better decisions and medical interventions.

AB  - Tobacco leaf position is closely associated with its quality whose material basis is the chemical components of tobacco leaf. In recent years, near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy combined with algorithmic models has emerged as a popular method for identifying the tobacco leaf position. However, when applied to leaf position discrimination, these models often rely on principal components derived from dimensionality-reduced spectral signals, resulting in limited interpretability and difficulty in identifying key chemical components. Chemical composition data combined with algorithmic models can also be used to discriminate tobacco leaf positions. However, the acquisition of chemical components relies on traditional instrumental analytical methods. As a result, the acquisition of chemical composition data is time-consuming and labor-intensive, involving only a limited number of compounds. The study proposes a novel approach that integrates machine learning with advanced interpretability techniques for both tobacco leaf position discrimination and analysis. Based on the 70 tobacco leaf chemical components obtained using near-infrared rapid analysis technology, tobacco leaf position discrimination models were built using Support Vector Machine (SVM), Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), and Random Forest (RF). Particle swarm optimization (PSO) was used to optimize parameters of each model. Chemical components were analyzed for statistical significance across leaf positions, and their influence on model predictions was interpreted using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). The experimental results showed that among all models, the SVM- hybrid kernel demonstrated the most robust and accurate performance, achieving discrimination accuracies of 98.17% and 96.33% on the training and test sets, respectively. SHAP analysis provided a clear ranking of feature importance and revealed the positive and negative contributions of individual chemical components. The proposed method can be useful for position traceability and chemical feature analysis of various crops.

AB  - The rational construction of high-performing MOF adsorbents for H2S/CO2/CH4 separation is essential for natural gas (NG) purification. However, trial-and-error experiments usually face significant challenges associated with unclear design routes. Especially the chemical design, which is decisive in geometrical properties and adsorption sites, thus playing substantial roles in molecule separation, has not been comprehensively understood yet. In this work, a combination of machine learning (ML)-assisted computational screening protocol based on similar to 1,000 simulation data and molecular fingerprint was performed to accelerate the discovery of promising MOFs for H2S/CO2/CH4 separation. The reliability of the adopted ML algorithm on our proposed comprehensive separation metric (TNSR) was further verified by another 50 MOFs with a small absolute mean error (AME) of 2.95. Encouragingly, 463 out of over 10,000 unpredicted MOFs were rapidly identified using the developed ML -assisted screening protocol. Among them, five additional top-performing MOFs (TNSR > 65) were successfully located, with the best one showing a TNSR of 82.39, 5-9 times higher than some well-known adsorbents (i.e. CuBTC, ZIF-69) at the same condition. During establishing the screening protocol, the chemical characteristics particular to the high-performing MOFs and the different effects of aromatic and alkyl ligands on separation were understood in detail. Different from the previous work, it was found that MOFs with transitional metals can also be unfavorable, mainly due to the specific metal coordination formed under various conditions. This work emphasizes the importance of chemical design and aims to provide an accurate screening strategy to discover promising MOFs for natural gas purification.

AB  - Smartphones enable to collect large data streams about phone calls that, once combined with Computational Intelligence techniques, bring great potential for improving the monitoring of patients with mental illnesses. However, the acoustic data streams recorded in uncontrolled environments are dynamically changing due to various sources of uncertainty. In addition, such acoustic data are usually difficult to interpret by psychiatrists. Within this study, we propose an approach based on Linguistic Summaries with Fuzzy Clustering (LS-FC) aiming at the development of human-consistent and easily interpretable summaries about relations between acoustic data and mental state of a patient affected by Bipolar Disorder, e.g., Most calls in the state of hypomania have low loudness compared to the state of euthymia [T = 1]. To capture the dynamics of acoustic data streams, we apply a dynamic incremental semi-supervised fuzzy clustering that synthesizes data into clusters. These clusters are represented by prototypes which are used for the construction of the membership functions describing linguistic terms e.g., low loudness, and then, linguistic summaries. The main contribution of this paper is the incorporation of information about clusters' prototypes in the generation of linguistic summaries. The primary goal of this research is explainability. The semi-supervised learning algorithm is used mainly for deriving clusters and building improved linguistic summaries. Numerical results indicate that linguistic summaries provide intuitive and clear information about voice features in a patient's affective state and they are consistent with clinical observation. In particular, during most calls in hypomania/mania both the quality of the patient's voice and the dynamics of change in the spectrum signal reflected in spectral flux are low compared to euthymia. The proposed approach enables to summarize large data streams into meaningful descriptions that, although relatively simple, offer information granules that are very intuitive for clinicians and are promising to support the smartphone-based monitoring of bipolar disorder patients to inform about the potential change of mental state.

AB  - Heat pump systems coupled with Borehole heat exchanger (BHEx) are crucial for the efficient and cost-effective heating and cooling of buildings. Accurate performance forecasting of BHEx can help to reduce energy consumption, optimize system design, improve system reliability and ultimately contribute to the sustainability of the built environment. The performance of deep neural networks, including hybrid deep learning algorithms, is dependent on the number and true identification of input parameters used to train the model. While research on the accuracy and selection of individual deep neural networks is well-investigated, the impact of selected input parameters on hybrid algorithm selection and its subsequent influence on multi-step forecasting performance has not been quantified specifically for geothermal heating/cooling systems. The focus of the current work is to investigate and quantify this impact on multivariate hybrid deep learning algorithms for forecasting borehole heat exchanger outlet temperature. In the current work the developed hybrid AI models (LSTM-CNN, GRU-CNN, CNN-LSTM, CNN-GRU) have been trained, validated, and tested using the measured borehole-field data with variable number of input parameters (3,4,5 and 6). The validated AI models are used to forecast 24 h ahead performance of borehole heat exchanger to meet the heating and cooling loads. The most essential input parameters for the data-driven AI models are determined via an importance-level analysis by using Explainable AI techniques of Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). The findings show that increasing the number of input parameters has the potential to enhance the multi-step forecasting accuracy of the examined deep learning models. However, it is crucial to note that there is a point where including additional input parameters may not lead to further improvements. Therefore, it is essential to identify the optimal number of input parameters that can maximize the accuracy of the hybrid deep learning models. Moreover, the analysis highlights that depending on the architecture of specific model layers, it is possible to eliminate redundant weather sensors associated with time variables without compromising the accuracy of the hybrid deep learning models.

AB  - Simple Summary Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the leading causes of mortality for men worldwide. PCa aggressiveness affects the patient's prognosis, with less aggressive tumors, i.e., Grade Group (GG) 1 and 2, having lower mortality and better outcomes. For this reason, the aim of this study is to distinguish between GG <= 2 and >= 3 PCa using an automatic and noninvasive approach based on artificial intelligence methods. The results obtained are promising, as the system achieved robust results on a multicenter external dataset. If further validated, this approach, combined with the expert knowledge of urologists, could help identify PCa patients who have a better prognosis and may benefit from less invasive treatments.Abstract In the last years, several studies demonstrated that low-aggressive (Grade Group (GG) <= 2) and high-aggressive (GG >= 3) prostate cancers (PCas) have different prognoses and mortality. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop and externally validate a radiomic model to noninvasively classify low-aggressive and high-aggressive PCas based on biparametric magnetic resonance imaging (bpMRI). To this end, 283 patients were retrospectively enrolled from four centers. Features were extracted from apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps and T2-weighted (T2w) sequences. A cross-validation (CV) strategy was adopted to assess the robustness of several classifiers using two out of the four centers. Then, the best classifier was externally validated using the other two centers. An explanation for the final radiomics signature was provided through Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) values and partial dependence plots (PDP). The best combination was a naive Bayes classifier trained with ten features that reached promising results, i.e., an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.75 and 0.73 in the construction and external validation set, respectively. The findings of our work suggest that our radiomics model could help distinguish between low- and high-aggressive PCa. This noninvasive approach, if further validated and integrated into a clinical decision support system able to automatically detect PCa, could help clinicians managing men with suspicion of PCa.

AB  - The construction of an accurate train control model (TCM) is crucial to the design of automatic train operation and real-time traffic management systems in high-speed railways. Traditional physical-driven models usually fail to reflect the "true" dynamics of high-speed trains (HSTs) because of the strong nonlinearity and uncertainty due to air resistance, frequently switching working conditions, and variations in external influencing factors such as weather and temperature. Although some data-driven deep learning models have recently been proposed for environmental adaptation, they are all "black box" models, which cannot explain how the input of the models affects the HST output. To overcome these issues, this study constructs a novel long short-term memory with lagged information (LAG-LSTM) model by combining the physical-driven HST model and an "interpretable" deep learning model. Specifically, our LAG-LSTM model contains three modules: a time-delay variable module to model the transform delay of control variables, state variable enhancement module to extract the key features among high dimensional input data, and Pre-LSTM module to predict the future train trajectory with given control variables. We collected field data from the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway and developed a data filter method and a normalization procedure to overcome the positioning errors of HSTs and construct a standard data set. Finally, we tested the effectiveness of our LAG-LSTM by comparing it with six deep learning structures, including fully connected neural network, recursive neural network, standard LSTM, and LSTM with convolutional layers. The results show that LAG-LSTM can accurately predict the trajectories of HSTs and outperforms other deep learning models. Regarding prediction accuracy, LAG-LSTM improved the performance of the traditional LSTM by 13.5% to 23.3%. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile compared to traditional financial markets. Hence, forecasting its volatility is crucial for risk management. In this paper, we investigate CryptoQuant data (e.g. on-chain analytics, exchange and miner data) and whale-alert tweets, and explore their relationship to Bitcoin's next-day volatility, with a focus on extreme volatility spikes. We propose a deep learning Synthesizer Transformer model for forecasting volatility. Our results show that the model outperforms existing state-of-the-art models when forecasting extreme volatility spikes for Bitcoin using CryptoQuant data as well as whale-alert tweets. We analysed our model with the Captum XAI library to investigate which features are most important. We also backtested our prediction results with different baseline trading strategies and the results show that we are able to minimize drawdown while keeping steady profits. Our findings underscore that the proposed method is a useful tool for forecasting extreme volatility movements in the Bitcoin market.

AB  - Consistency is a key attribute for apple pure<acute accent>e producers, since it affects the product quality and acceptability, and can be used to regulate the process settings. This study aims to build a statistical model to predict puree consistency using data collected from an industrial production line. The dataset includes 14 variables across 524 samples, comprising process parameters (e.g., pump performance, temperature) and characteristics of the apples. Three predictive models were developed incrementally. Model 1 relied on the mechanical energy conservation law to establish a relationship between a measured pressure drop and the consistency. In this study, we quantify consistency using the Bostwick flow distance, a widely adopted practical proxy for apparent viscosity in the food industry. Model 2 incorporated the machinery-related parameters, and Model 3 further integrated the characteristics of the apples to account for raw material variability. For models training and validation, generalized linear models (GLM), gradient boosting machines (GBM), and deep learning (DL) architectures were compared. The effect of the different input variables on the predictive performance was also assessed. In all models, pressure difference emerged as the most influential variable. Model 3, particularly with GBM, resulted in the highest predictive accuracy (R2 = 0.78; MAPE = 9.2 %), demonstrating the importance of incorporating ripening information of the apples in the model. The model outperforms traditional laboratory-based viscosity measurements, which typically have greater variability. The model considers the interactions between processing conditions and raw material properties that influence puree rheology, enabling a real-time inline consistency monitoring of apple puree in industrial settings, offering manufacturers operational benefits. These include the potential for reducing manual testing time and decreasing production costs through minimized batch rejections, and the ability to implement timely process adjustments. These advantages collectively contribute to reduced product waste, enhanced quality control, and improved economic outcomes in commercial apple puree production.

AB  - Context: Precision agriculture leverages advanced technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance crop productivity by providing data-driven insights. In Bangladesh, optimizing crop recommendations using real-time soil and environmental data is crucial for improving agricultural decision-making. However, integrating AI models with IoT devices for instantaneous crop prediction remains a challenge due to computational constraints and the need for model interpretability. Objective: This study aims to develop an IoT-based crop prediction system that utilizes real-time data on soil nutrients, pH, and weather conditions. The system employs machine learning and deep learning techniques to recommend suitable crops based on local environmental factors. The implementation focuses on deploying the best-performing models on an edge device for real-time predictions as well as ensuring accuracy, efficiency, and accessibility for farmers and agricultural stakeholders. Methods: The system was developed in Bangladesh using proprietary data from the Soil Resource Development Institute, supported by Habiganj Agricultural University, Sylhet. The dataset consists of 3,300 samples covering 22 crops and eight soil and environmental features. Several machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Stacking ensembles, as well as deep learning models such as TabNet, were evaluated for crop prediction. The best-performing models were deployed on a Raspberry Pi 5 edge device for real-time inference. A weather API was integrated for local humidity and rainfall data, while an RS485 7-in-1 agricultural soil sensor provided real-time measurements of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), pH, temperature, and soil moisture. The predictions were displayed on the ThingsBoard IoT platform. Model interpretability was enhanced using the explainable AI technique LIME. A user survey involving farmers, agricultural researchers, and students assessed the usability, accuracy, and reliability of the system. Results and conclusions: The highest accuracy among machine learning models was achieved using Random Forest (95.8%) and Gradient Boosting (95.5%). The Stacking ensemble technique, with Support Vector Classifier (SVC) as the meta-classifier, achieved the highest overall accuracy of 95.9%. Among deep learning models, TabNet performed best with an accuracy of 92%. The Random Forest model was selected for deployment on the Raspberry Pi due to its lowest inference time and compatibility with Python and TensorFlow Lite. User feedback from the survey provided insights into the system's practical effectiveness and potential areas for improvement. The results demonstrate that integrating AI-driven crop recommendation models with IoT devices can support realtime agricultural decision-making, improving precision farming outcomes. Significance: This study contributes to precision agriculture by demonstrating an IoT-based crop prediction system that integrates AI-driven recommendations with real-time environmental monitoring. The deployment of the best-performing model on an edge device ensures accessibility and efficiency for users in agricultural settings. By leveraging explainable AI techniques, the study enhances model interpretability, fostering trust and usability among farmers and agricultural researchers.
   The findings highlight the potential of AI and IoT in improving crop Agricultural Technology selection, optimizing resource usage, and supporting sustainable agricultural practices in Bangladesh and beyond.

AB  - This review aims to analyze the development and impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the context of Saudi Arabia's public healthcare system to fulfill Vision 2030 objectives. It is extensively devoted to AI technology deployment relevant to disease management, healthcare delivery, epidemiology, and policy-making. However, its AI is culturally sensitive and ethically grounded in Islam. Based on the PRISMA framework, an SLR evaluated primary academic literature, cases, and practices of Saudi Arabia's AI implementation in the public healthcare sector. Instead, it categorizes prior research based on how AI can work, the issues it poses, and its implications for the Kingdom's healthcare system. The Saudi Arabian context analyses show that AI has increased the discreet prediction of diseases, resource management, and monitoring outbreaks during mass congregations such as hajj. Therefore, the study outlines critical areas for defining the potential for artificial intelligence and areas for enhancing digital development to support global healthcare progress. The key themes emerging from the review include Saudi Arabia: (i) the effectiveness of AI with human interaction for sustainable health services; (ii) conditions and quality control to enhance the quality of health care services using AI; (iii) environmental factors as influencing factors for public health care; (iv) Artificial Intelligence, and advanced decision-making technology for Middle Eastern health care systems. For policymakers, healthcare managers, and researchers who will engage with AI innovation, the review proclaims that AI applications should respect the country's socio-cultural and ethical practices and pave the way for sustainable healthcare provision. More empirical research is needed on the implementation issues with AI, creating culturally appropriate models of AI, and finding new applications of AIto address the increasing demand for healthcare services in Saudi Arabia.

AB  - The classification of surrounding rock mass is essential for characterizing rock properties and geological conditions in tunneling engineering. While numerous empirical rock mass classification systems have been proposed (e.g., rock mass rating system, rock structure rating system), they tend to heavily rely on engineers' experience, which is unfavorable for tunnel construction, particularly in deep-buried and ultralong tunnels. Alternatively, machine learning, i.e., artificial intelligence (AI), methods estimate the classification of the surrounding rock mass using certain readily available rock indices (e.g., volumetric joint count). However, most machine learning models are considered black box models, leading to unexplainable predictions. In addition, employing all measurements of readily available rock indices as input may lead to excessive model complexity and a reduction in generalization performance. In this case, a Gaussian process classification (GPC) approach combined with the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), Bayesian framework, and SHapley Additive exPlanations is proposed in this study for the probabilistic classification of the surrounding rock mass and selection of the optimal GPC model based on imbalanced and sparse measurement data. It is worth noting that the proposed method can also provide physics-informed explanations for the prediction and model class selection results and determine the significant input variables for each grade of the surrounding rock mass. A real-life example is employed to illustrate and validate the proposed approach. The results show that the F-1 score of the optimal GPC model reaches 0.93, which is comparable with those of the GPC model with all input variables.

AB  - Skin lesion segmentation plays a crucial role in the computer-aided diagnosis of melanoma. Deep Learning models have shown promise in accurately segmenting skin lesions, but their widespread adoption in real-life clinical settings is hindered by their inherent black-box nature. In domains as critical as healthcare, interpretability is not merely a feature but a fundamental requirement for model adoption. This paper proposes IARS SegNet an advanced segmentation framework built upon the SegNet baseline model. Our approach incorporates three critical components: Skip connections, residual convolutions, and a global attention mechanism onto the baseline Segnet architecture. These elements play a pivotal role in accentuating the significance of clinically relevant regions, particularly the contours of skin lesions. The inclusion of skip connections enhances the model's capacity to learn intricate contour details, while the use of residual convolutions allows for the construction of a deeper model while preserving essential image features. The global attention mechanism further contributes by extracting refined feature maps from each convolutional and deconvolutional block, thereby elevating the model's interpretability. This enhancement highlights critical regions, fosters better understanding, and leads to more accurate skin lesion segmentation for melanoma diagnosis. This study primarily focuses on the interpretation of performance improvements in the base model resulting from the integration of each of these three components. To comprehensively assess the performance gain achieved with each addition, we employ two sets of evaluation metrics, quantifying performance based on both regions and contours. The results underscore the superior segmentation capabilities of the proposed architecture compared to the SegNet and U-Net models. Notably, the model's performance gain due to each enhancement is visually interpretable.

AB  - Our interest in this paper is in the construction of symbolic explanations for predictions made by a deep neural network. We will focus attention on deep relational machines (DRMs: a term introduced in Lodhi (2013)). A DRM is a deep network in which the input layer consists of Boolean-valued functions (features) that are defined in terms of relations provided as domain, or background, knowledge. Our DRMs differ from those in Lodhi (2013), which uses an Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) engine to first select features (we use random selections from a space of features that satisfies some approximate constraints on logical relevance and non-redundancy). But why do the DRMs predict what they do? One way of answering this was provided in recent work Ribeiro et al. (2016), by constructing readable proxies for a black-box predictor. The proxies are intended only to model the predictions of the black-box in local regions of the instance-space. But readability alone may not be enough: to be understandable, the local models must use relevant concepts in an meaningful manner. We investigate the use of a Bayes-like approach to identify logical proxies for local predictions of a DRM. As a preliminary step, we show that DRM's with our randomised propositionalization method achieve predictive performance that is comparable to the best reports in the ILP literature. Our principal results on logical explanations show: (a) Models in first-order logic can approximate the DRM's prediction closely in a small local region; and (b) Expert-provided relevance information can play the role of a prior to distinguish between logical explanations that perform equivalently on prediction alone.

AB  - The development of explainable health indicators (HIs) for multi-component mechatronic systems is vital for monitoring their performance, ensuring their reliability, and optimizing their operational efficiency across a wide range of industries. These indicators play a pivotal role in detecting and diagnosing faults, assessing system health, and guiding maintenance decisions. However, achieving explainability in HIs poses significant challenges, including the selection of the most relevant sensors, the accurate modeling of degradation trends influenced by maintenance activities, and the integration of component dynamics into a system-level representation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel methodology for constructing hierarchical HIs - a two-level structure where component-level degradation signals are first modeled individually, then systematically aggregated to form a comprehensive system-level health representation. The proposed approach, named TRSAE, incorporates an automated sensor selection process to identify the most important sensors, reducing redundancy while improving interpretability. Furthermore, maintenance and downtime effects are explicitly integrated into the modeling process to ensure a more realistic and reliable assessment of system health. By tackling these challenges, our methodology improves transparency in system behavior, strengthens diagnostic capabilities, and builds trust in predictive maintenance decisions. The proposed methodology is validated through a case study in an iron mining system, an environment characterized by extreme operating conditions and continuous heavy loads that accelerate the degradation of critical components. The case study demonstrates how hierarchical HIs can capture complex degradation dynamics, optimize sensor usage, and improve remaining useful life (RUL) predictions, offering actionable insights for proactive maintenance planning and reliable system operation.

AB  - Objective This study aimed to develop and validate a comprehensive machine learning framework combining radiomic features, deep features extracted from CT images, and clinical variables to predict and stratify asthma severity into three clinically defined categories. Materials and methods CT imaging and clinical data from 1365 patients across three medical centers were retrospectively collected. Lung segmentation was performed manually by two expert radiologists using 3D Slicer, with reproducibility assessed via the Dice Similarity Coefficient. A total of 215 radiomic features were extracted following IBSI standards, and 512 deep features were obtained through a custom attention-based autoencoder. All features were filtered using ICC (>0.75), correlation analysis (r < 0.9), and LASSO regression. Five machine learning models-XGBoost, LightGBM, Autoencoder, GAT, and a Hybrid Deep Attention-LSTM-were trained using stratified 70/10/20 train-validation-test splits. SHAP analysis, nomogram construction, and decision curve analysis (DCA) were applied for model interpretability and clinical relevance assessment. Results The Hybrid Deep Attention-LSTM model achieved the highest classification performance, with 95.7 % accuracy and 98.0 % AUC on the test set. All models using combined features outperformed radiomic-only or deep-only models. SHAP analysis identified FEV1, BMI, shortness of breath, and nighttime symptoms as key clinical predictors. The nomogram provided interpretable risk visualization, while DCA confirmed the hybrid model's superior net benefit across threshold probabilities compared to standard machine learning models. Conclusions The study presents a reproducible, interpretable, and high-performing model for asthma severity classification using integrated radiomic, deep, and clinical features, with potential for real-world clinical deployment in personalized asthma care.

AB  - Background and objective: Patients who survive sepsis in the intensive care unit (ICU) (sepsis survivors) have an increased risk of long-term mortality and ICU readmission. We aim to identify the risk factors for in-hospital mortality in sepsis survivors with later ICU readmission and visualize the quantitative relationship between the individual risk factors and mortality by applying machine learning (ML) algorithm.
   Methods: Data were obtained from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database for sepsis and non-sepsis ICU survivors who were later readmitted to the ICU. The data on the first day of ICU readmission and the in-hospital mortality was combined for the ML algorithm modeling and the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value of the correlation between the risk factors and the outcome.
   Results: Among the 2970 enrolled patients, in-hospital mortality during ICU readmission was significantly higher in sepsis survivors ( n = 2228) than nonsepsis survivors ( n = 742) (50.4% versus 30.7%, P < 0.001). The ML algorithm identified 18 features that were associated with a risk of mortality in these groups; among these, BUN, age, weight, and minimum heart rate were shared by both groups, and the remaining mean systolic pressure, urine output, albumin, platelets, lactate, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), potassium, pCO2, pO2, respiration rate, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score for eye-opening, anion gap, sex and temperature were specific to previous sepsis survivors. The ML algorithm also calculated the quantitative contribution and noteworthy threshold of each factor to the risk of mortality in sepsis survivors.
   Conclusion: 14 specific parameters with corresponding thresholds were found to be associated with the in-hospital mortality of sepsis survivors during the ICU readmission. The construction of advanced ML techniques could support the analysis and development of predictive models that can be used to support the decisions and treatment strategies made in a clinical setting in critical care patients.

AB  - The integration of deep learning techniques with financial technology (fintech) has revolutionized the credit risk analysis, a critical component of financial risk management. A pervasive challenge in credit risk assessment lies in the skewed distribution of data, hindering accurate predictions, particularly for minority class instances. In available literature, various solutions have been proposed to address class imbalance, albeit with limitations. Focal loss is one of the well-known loss functions proposed for handling class imbalance by running the hyperparameter gamma$$ \gamma $$. However, imbalance still remains in terms of number of hard-to-learn observations between the classes. In this paper, we have proposed integration of ADASYN with focal loss to mitigate class imbalance and enhance credit scoring accuracy. ADASYN systematically generates synthetic data based on hard-to-learn examples to counter skewed distributions, while focal loss prioritizes the training of challenging examples, fostering a more balanced model performance. This approach has been rigorously tested using real-world imbalanced datasets and credit assessment data, and the outcomes have been compared against a range of sample technique and loss function combinations. The results clearly show that our suggested strategy is better than other approaches. Although improving the accuracy of credit risk analysis is critical, model interpretability is just as important for enabling financial analysts to make wise choices. In order to solve this, we have measured the global and local contributions of each feature using SHAP (Shapley additive explanation). According to global interpretability, the top 4 parameters influencing credit risk assessment are checking account status, loan purpose, borrower age, credit history, and interest rate/installment rate. Moreover, local interpretability analysis reveals quantitative and direction differences in feature contributions. These revelations not only broaden our knowledge of credit assessment services but also highlight how important a role they could play in attracting new clients and generating income. This paper also highlights how the suggested approach may be scaled to other imbalanced real-world datasets, demonstrating how it can improve model performance in terms of AUC, G-mean, and F-measure.

AB  - Seed quality traits, such as seed size, oil and protein content, mineral accumulation, and morphological characteristics, are crucial for enhancing crop productivity, nutritional value, and marketability. Traditional quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping methods, such as linkage analysis and genome-wide association studies (GWAS), have played fundamental role in identifying loci associated with these complex traits. However, these approaches often struggle with high-dimensional genomic data, polygenic inheritance, and genotype-by-environment (GXE) interactions. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) provide powerful alternatives that enable more accurate trait prediction, robust marker-trait associations, and efficient feature selection. This review presents an integrated overview of AI/ML applications in QTL mapping and seed trait prediction, highlighting key methodologies such as LASSO regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, ElasticNet, and deep learning techniques including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). A case study on soybean seed mineral nutrients accumulation illustrates the effectiveness of ML models in identifying significant SNPs on chromosomes 8, 9, and 14. LASSO and ElasticNet consistently achieved superior predictive accuracy compared to tree-based models. Beyond soybean, AI/ML methods have enhanced QTL detection in wheat, lettuce, rice, and cotton, supporting trait dissection across diverse crop species. I also explored AI-driven integration of multi-omics data-genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and phenomics-to improve resolution in QTL mapping. While challenges remain in terms of model interpretability, biological validation, and computational scalability, ongoing developments in explainable AI, multi-view learning, and high-throughput phenotyping offer promising avenues. This review underscores the transformative potential of AI in accelerating genomic-assisted breeding and developing high-quality, climate-resilient crop varieties.

AB  - This work investigates real-time monitoring of extrusion-induced degradation in different grades of PLA across a range of process conditions and machine set-ups. Data on machine settings together with in-process sensor data, including temperature, pressure, and near-infrared (NIR) spectra, are used as inputs to predict the molecular weight and mechanical properties of the product. Many soft sensor approaches based on complex spectral data are essentially 'black-box' in nature, which can limit industrial acceptability. Hence, the focus here is on identifying an optimal approach to developing interpretable models while achieving high predictive accuracy and robustness across different process settings. The performance of a Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) approach was compared to more common dimension reduction and regression approaches including Partial Least Squares (PLS), iterative PLS (i-PLS), Principal Component Regression (PCR), ridge regression, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), and Random Forest (RF). It is shown that for medical-grade PLA processed under moisture-controlled conditions, accurate prediction of molecular weight is possible over a wide range of process conditions and different machine settings (different nozzle types for downstream fibre spinning) with an RFE-RF algorithm. Similarly, for the prediction of yield stress, RFE-RF achieved excellent predictive performance, outperforming the other approaches in terms of simplicity, interpretability, and accuracy. The features selected by the RFE model provide important insights to the process. It was found that change in molecular weight was not an important factor affecting the mechanical properties of the PLA, which is primarily related to the pressure and temperature at the latter stages of the extrusion process. The temperature at the extruder exit was also the most important predictor of degradation of the polymer molecular weight, highlighting the importance of accurate melt temperature control in the process. RFE not only outperforms more established methods as a soft sensor method, but also has significant advantages in terms of computational efficiency, simplicity, and interpretability. RFE-based soft sensors are promising for better quality control in processing thermally sensitive polymers such as PLA, in particular demonstrating for the first time the ability to monitor molecular weight degradation during processing across various machine settings.

AB  - The construction and operation of large-scale hydraulic projects improve water resource utilization efficiency, but negatively impact ecology and environment, especially exacerbating the eutrophication risk in the fluctuating backwater zones (FBZs). However, Due to its dual characteristics of both rivers and reservoirs, eutrophication patterns in FBZs have not been explored comprehensively. This study focuses on the FBZ formed by the Three Gorges Dam (TGD), the world's largest hydropower plant. By integrating the multi-source monitoring data with Normalized Difference Chlorophyll Index (NDCI) inversed by remote sensing data, interpretable machine learning methods (XGBoost and SHAP) were applied to quantify the contributions of key eutrophication drivers. The results showed that as the water storage level rose to 175 m (2010-2016), the total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations in the FBZ increased by 10.4 % and 5.9 % respectively, compared to the natural river period (2004-2005). While TP concentrations have decreased in recent years (2021-2023), the pollution risk from TN has not been mitigated. Eutrophication drivers exhibit notable variability across different temporal scales, with pollutant emissions resulting from intense human activities being the primary drivers of elevated TN and TP concentrations on an annual scale. Seasonal variations in rainfall and temperature result in temporal heterogeneity in nutrient concentrations on a monthly scale. SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) analysis reveals that the TGR's water storage volume and runoff load in the FBZ account for 45.9 % of the total influence on algal blooms. This result highlights that reduced flow velocity, driven by upstream and downstream dam impoundments, is the dominant factor behind algal bloom outbreaks in the FBZ. This study analyses the complex influences that trigger algal blooms in the FBZ which differ from rivers and lakes, and that could provide important references for managing eutrophication in global FBZs.

AB  - PurposeCholangiocyte phenotype hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is highly invasive. This study aims to develop and validate an optimal machine learning model to predict cholangiocyte phenotype HCC based on T1 mapping gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI and to implement individual applications via the Shapley Additive explanation (SHAP).MethodsWe included 180 patients with histologically confirmed HCC from two institutions. Clinical and MRI imaging features were screened for predicting cholangiocyte phenotype hepatocellular carcinoma using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and the logistic regression analysis. Five machine learning models were constructed based on these features. A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis aims to compare prognostic differences between cholangiocyte phenotype-positive HCC groups and classical (cholangiocyte phenotype-negative) HCC groups, and was conducted to explore the prognostic information of the optimal model.ResultsThe most significant clinicoradiological features, including the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), tumor capsule, target sign on hepatobiliary phase (HBP), and T1 relaxation time of 20 min (T1rt-20 min), were selected to construct the prediction model. Finally, we selected the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model as the optimal predictive model, which achieved AUCs of 0.835, 0.830, 0.816 and 0.776 in training, internal validation, external validation, and prospective validation cohorts, respectively, for visual analysis via SHAP, in which T1rt-20 min made a significant contribution. Survival analysis showed a statistically significant difference in relapse-free survival (RFS) between cholangiocyte phenotype-positive HCC groups and classical HCC groups from institution I (hazard ratio [HR] 1.994; 95% CI, 1.059-3.758; P = 0.027), and the construction XGBoost model can be used to stratify RFS according to prognosis (HR, 1.986; 95% CI, 1.061-3.717; P = 0.029).ConclusionThe machine learning model utilizing T1 mapping gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI demonstrates significant potential in identifying cholangiocyte phenotype HCC. Furthermore, personalized prediction is enhanced through the application of SHAP, providing valuable insights to support clinical decision-making processes.

AB  - This study aims to develop and validate a machine learning (ML) predictive model for assessing mortality in patients with malignant tumors and hyperkalemia (MTH). We extracted data on patients with MTH from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV, version 2.2 (MIMIC-IV v2.2) database. The dataset was split into a training set (75%) and a validation set (25%). We used the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression to identify potential predictors, which included clinical laboratory indicators and vital signs. Pearson correlation analysis tested the correlation between predictors. In-hospital death was the prediction target. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) and accuracy of the training and validation sets of 7 ML algorithms were compared, and the optimal 1 was selected to develop the model. The calibration curve was used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the model further. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) enhanced model interpretability. 496 patients with MTH in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) were included. After screening, 17 clinical features were included in the construction of the ML model, and the Pearson correlation coefficient was <0.8, indicating that the correlation between the clinical features was small. eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) outperformed other algorithms, achieving perfect scores in the training set (accuracy: 1.000, AUC: 1.000) and high scores in the validation set (accuracy: 0.734, AUC: 0.733). The calibration curves indicated good predictive calibration of the model. SHAP analysis identified the top 8 predictive factors: urine output, mean heart rate, maximum urea nitrogen, minimum oxygen saturation, minimum mean blood pressure, maximum total bilirubin, mean respiratory rate, and minimum pH. In addition, SHAP and LIME performed in-depth individual case analyses. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of ML methods in predicting mortality risk in ICU patients with MTH. It highlights the importance of predictors like urine output and mean heart rate. SHAP and LIME significantly enhanced the model's interpretability.

AB  - Background: Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) is a common complication following Type A aortic dissection (TAAD) surgery, significantly impacting prognosis and increasing mortality risk. This study developed and validated a predictive model based on machine learning (ML) algorithms to enable early and precise assessment of postoperative GIB risk in TAAD patients. Methods: Medical records of patients who underwent TAAD surgery at Shanxi Bethune Hospital from January 2019 to September 2024 were retrospectively collected. Predictors were screened using LASSO regression, and four ML algorithms-Random Forest (RF), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Decision Tree (DT)-were employed to construct models for predicting postoperative GIB risk. The dataset was divided into training and validation sets in a 7:3 ratio. Predictive performance was evaluated and compared using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and DeLong tests. Calibration curves and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to assess model calibration and clinical utility. The SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) algorithm was applied for interpretability analysis. This study adhered to the "Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis + Artificial Intelligence (TRIPOD+AI) guidelines." Results: A total of 525 TAAD patients were included, with 63 (12%) developing GIB. Nine predictors were selected via LASSO regression for model construction. The RF model outperformed the SVM, KNN, and DT models in predicting postoperative GIB, with areas under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.933, 0.892, 0.902, and 0.768, respectively, showing statistically significant differences (DeLong test, P < 0.05). Calibration curves and DCA further confirmed the RF model's excellent calibration and clinical utility. SHAP analysis identified the three most influential clinical features on the RF model's output: duration of mechanical ventilation (MV), Time to aortic occlusion, and red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. Conclusion: The machine learning-based predictive model effectively assesses postoperative GIB risk in TAAD patients, aiding healthcare providers in early identification of risk factors and implementation of targeted preventive strategies.

AB  - To create a diagnostic tool before biopsy for patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels < 20 ng/ml to minimize prostate biopsy-related discomfort and risks. Data from 655 patients who underwent transperineal prostate biopsy at the First Affiliated Hospital of Wannan Medical College from July 2021 to January 2023 were collected and analyzed. After applying the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique class balancing on the training set, multiple machine learning models were constructed by using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) feature selection to identify the significant variables. The best-performing model was selected and evaluated through tenfold cross-validation to ensure interpretability. Finally, the performance was assessed using the test set data for validation. The age, prostate-specific antigen mass ratio (PSAMR), Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System, and prostate volume were selected as the variables for model construction based on the LASSO regression. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) results for multiple models in the validation set were as follows: XGBoost: 0.93 (0.88-0.97); logistic: 0.89 (0.83-0.95); LightGBM: 0.87 (0.80-0.93); AdaBoost: 0.90 (0.85-0.96); GNB: 0.88 (0.82-0.95); CNB: 0.79 (0.71-0.87); MLP: 0.78 (0.69-0.86); and Support Vector Machine: 0.81 (0.73-0.89). XGBoost was selected as the best model and reconstructed with tenfold cross-validation on the training data, resulting in the following ROC scores: training set 0.995 (0.991-0.999), validation set 0.945 (0.885-0.997 ), and test set 0.920 (0.868-0.972). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov curve, calibration curve and learning curve yielded positive results; The decision curve demonstrates that patients with threshold probabilities ranging from 10 to 95% can benefit from this model. We developed an XGBoost machine learning model based on the PSAMR indicator and interpreted it using the SHapley Additive exPlanations method. The model offered a high-performance non-invasive technique to diagnose prostate cancer in patients with PSA levels < 20 ng/ml.

AB  - The applications of high-hardness refractory alloys in fields such as aerospace, nuclear energy, and the chemical industry are growing, driving the demand for new alloy designs. This paper aims to effectively predict the hardness of Ti-Zr-Nb-Ta alloys through the construction of machine learning models, so as to accelerate the development of new high-hardness alloys. The ETR model exhibits the highest prediction accuracy and the smallest error in both the training set and the test set, and shows good generalization ability on unknown data. Through PCC and MIC analysis, RMS_R, Tm, ENC, and APE are determined as the key features affecting the hardness of the alloy. Given that the small size of the original dataset affects the accuracy, data augmentation using a generative model was carried out, and the model accuracy was significantly improved when 200 generated data points were added. Subsequently, based on the high-precision model, the SHAP theory has been further introduced for interpretive analysis, and the results showed that the feature importance ranking is RMS_R, ENC, Tm, and APE. An increase in RMS_R and ENC, an elevation in Tm, and a decrease in APE all contribute to improving the hardness of the alloy. Based on the predictions of the machine learning model, it is determined that, in the Ti-Zr-Nb-Ta alloy, adding approximately 0.35 at.% of Ta and 0.35-0.45 at.% of Zr can achieve a hardness higher than 500 HV. In addition, considering features such as atomic size difference, effective charge number, melting point, and electronegativity, Cr, Mo, W, and Hf have been finally selected as new alloying elements to construct the Ti-Zr-Nb-Ta-X (X = Cr, Mo, W, Hf) alloy system, so as to accelerate the design of new high-hardness alloys. These research results provide an important theoretical basis and practical guidance for the development of high-performance refractory alloys in the future.

AB  - Background Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a prevalent complication in patients at risk of malnutrition, elevating the risks of acute kidney disease (AKD) and mortality. AKD reflects the adverse events developing after AKI. This study aimed to develop and validate machine learning (ML) models for predicting the occurrence of AKD, AKI and mortality in patients at risk of malnutrition.Methods We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients at risk of malnutrition. Eight ML algorithms were employed to predict AKD, AKI and mortality. The performance of the best model was evaluated using various metrics and interpreted using the SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method. An artificial intelligence (AI)-driven web application was also created based on the best model.Results A total of 13 395 patients were included in our study. Among them, 1751 (13.07%) developed subacute AKD, 1253 (9.35%) were transient AKI, and 1455 (10.86%) met both AKI and AKD criteria. The incidence rate of mortality was 6.74%. The light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) outperformed other models in predicting AKD, AKI and mortality, with area under curve values of 0.763, 0.801 and 0.881, respectively. The SHAP method revealed that AKI stage, lactate dehydrogenase, albumin, aspirin usage and serum creatinine were the top five predictors of AKD. An online prediction website for AKI, AKD and mortality was developed based on the final models.Conclusions The LGBM models provide an effective method for predicting AKD, AKI and mortality at an early stage in patients at risk of malnutrition, enabling prompt interventions. Compared with the AKD model, the models for predicting AKI and mortality perform better. The AI-driven web application can significantly aid in creating personalized preventive measures. Future work will aim to expand the application to larger, more diverse populations, incorporate additional biomarkers and refine ML algorithms to improve predictive accuracy and clinical utility.

AB  - This article is based on various studies undertaken by the author on Forced Migrations in Mozambique and it introduces to the radiography of a country, which has brought forth housing spaces deemed incomplete, that have resulted from a combination of political-military tensions, natural disasters, development projects and international migration trends. Mozambique is a Southern African country, located in the southern East side of the continent. The Channel of Mozambique lies in east coast limit zone of Mozambique in an extension of 2700Km stretch. Since its independence from Portugal in 1975, the country has undergone through some significant metamorphoses in its geographical territorial space, originated by cyclical natural disasters, political and military events; social and economic factors that hindered development and made people not realize the true meaning of sedentary, as there is an emergency call towards Internally Displaced persons and refugees. It is on record that upon its independence, the country adopted a "hospitable policy" of hosting people that were escaping from oppressive regimes such as "the likes" of Chile, former Southern Rhodesia (currently Zimbabwe), East Timor and South Africa. Due to geographical location factors and the fact that the country enjoyed military peace between 1992 and 2013, Mozambique played an important role in hosting asylum seekers and refugees from the Region of Great lakes of Africa and the Horn of Africa, apart from investors and those who pretended to be investors, the country saw an influx of people from different parts of the world, Africa being the main contributor, Middle East, Europe, China, North America and Brazil have contributed to the spatial shape of Mozambique. It is important to refer that the immigrant population and those that are fleeing rarely fixe their "roots" in hosting countries. The reason being, it is possible to observe in all national territory the existence of places which reflects the reminiscent of a war thorn scenario, which either construction buildings are not yet concluded or are partially destroyed. The example of such, for instance the City of Xai-Xai in Southern Mozambique, with the heavy sand project, the province of Sofala and the unfinished Sugar plantation project while in Mandimba district in northern Mozambique, a place filled with ruins. The development projects in course reflect without a doubt the emergency character of a country with never-ending conflicts and under reconstruction. It is about a vicious cycle that along time remained an obstacle in allocating, housing spaces for construction purposes and for that I call incomplete spaces or unfinished spaces.

AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is a crucial parameter reflecting the crown structure of the grassland. Accurately obtaining LAI is of great significance for estimating carbon sinks in grassland ecosystems. However, spectral noise interference and pronounced spatial heterogeneity within vegetation canopies constitute significant impediments to achieving high-precision LAI retrieval. This study used hyperspectral sensor mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to estimate LAI in a typical grassland, Hulun Lake Basin. Multiple machine learning (ML) models were constructed to reveal a relationship between hyperspectral data and grassland LAI using two input datasets, namely spectral transformations and vegetation indices (VIs), while SHAP (SHapley Additive ExPlanation) interpretability analysis was further employed to identify high-contribution features in the ML models. The analysis revealed that grassland LAI has good correlations with the original spectrum at 550 nm and 750 nm-1000 nm, first and second derivatives at 506 nm-574 nm, 649 nm-784 nm, and vegetation indices including the triangular vegetation index (TVI), enhanced vegetation index 2 (EVI2), and soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI). In the models using spectral transformations and VIs, the random forest (RF) models outperformed other models (testing R2 = 0.89/0.88, RMSE = 0.20/0.21, and RRMSE = 27.34%/28.98%). The prediction error of the random forest model exhibited a positive correlation with measured LAI magnitude but demonstrated an inverse relationship with quadrat-level species richness, quantified by Margalef's richness index (MRI). We also found that at the quadrat level, the spectral response curve pattern is influenced by attributes within the quadrat, like dominant species and vegetation cover, and that LAI has positive relationship with quadrat vegetation cover. The LAI inversion results in this study were also compared to main LAI products, showing a good correlation (r = 0.71). This study successfully established a high-fidelity inversion framework for hyperspectral-derived LAI estimation in mid-to-high latitude grasslands of the Hulun Lake Basin, supporting the spatial refinement of continental-scale carbon sink models at a regional scale.

AB  - The advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) in remote sensing (RS) increasingly depends on datasets that offer rich and structured supervision beyond traditional scene-level labels. Although existing benchmarks for aerial scene classification have facilitated progress in this area, their reliance on single-class annotations restricts their application to more flexible, interpretable and generalisable learning frameworks. In this study, we introduce WHU-RS19 ABZSL: an attribute-based extension of the widely adopted WHU-RS19 dataset. This new version comprises 1005 high-resolution aerial images across 19 scene categories, each annotated with a vector of 38 features. These cover objects (e.g., roads and trees), geometric patterns (e.g., lines and curves) and dominant colours (e.g., green and blue), and are defined through expert-guided annotation protocols. To demonstrate the value of the dataset, we conduct baseline experiments using deep learning models that had been adapted for multi-label classification-ResNet18, VGG16, InceptionV3, EfficientNet and ViT-B/16-designed to capture the semantic complexity characteristic of real-world aerial scenes. The results, which are measured in terms of macro F1-score, range from 0.7385 for ResNet18 to 0.7608 for EfficientNet-B0. In particular, EfficientNet-B0 and ViT-B/16 are the top performers in terms of the overall macro F1-score and consistency across attributes, while all models show a consistent decline in performance for infrequent or visually ambiguous categories. This confirms that it is feasible to accurately predict semantic attributes in complex scenes. By enriching a standard benchmark with detailed, image-level semantic supervision, WHU-RS19 ABZSL supports a variety of downstream applications, including multi-label classification, explainable AI, semantic retrieval, and attribute-based ZSL. It thus provides a reusable, compact resource for advancing the semantic understanding of remote sensing and multimodal AI.

AB  - Environmental assessments are critical for ensuring the sustainable development of human civilization. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in these assessments has shown great promise, yet the "black box" nature of AI models often undermines trust due to the lack of transparency in their decision-making processes, even when these models demonstrate high accuracy. To address this challenge, we evaluated the performance of a transformer model against other AI approaches, utilizing extensive multivariate and spatiotemporal environmental datasets encompassing both natural and anthropogenic indicators. We further explored the application of saliency maps as a novel explainability tool in multi-source AI-driven environmental assessments, enabling the identification of individual indicators' contributions to the model's predictions. We find that the transformer model outperforms others, achieving an accuracy of about 98% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.891. Regionally, the environmental assessment values are predominantly classified as level II or III in the central and southwestern study areas, level IV in the northern region, and level V in the western region. Through explainability analysis, we identify that water hardness, total dissolved solids, and arsenic concentrations are the most influential indicators in the model. Our AI-driven environmental assessment model is accurate and explainable, offering actionable insights for targeted environmental management. Furthermore, this study advances the application of AI in environmental science by presenting a robust, explainable model that bridges the gap between machine learning and environmental governance, enhancing both understanding and trust in AI-assisted environmental assessments.

AB  - Droughts typically develop gradually, and early prediction is crucial for the government to formulate effective mitigation plans. Our approach does not involve predicting specific drought index values. Instead, we forecast whether a particular year will experience drought. Insufficient investigation has been carried out regarding variations in additional climatic indicators like shortwave radiation, wind speed, sea level, and pollution in the context of droughts in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. In the study period taken from 1995 to 2020, only three years (2002, 2009, and 2017) experienced drought occurrences, resulting in an imbalanced dataset. To enhance the classification performance of this imbalanced dataset, a weighted dataset is constructed using a feature weighting approach known as the Single Objective Scorer (SOS) based Multi-objective PSO(MPSO) in conjunction with the Gradient Boosting Classifier. The proposed model facilitates objective-based multi-population formation and neighborhood learning. Precision and recall are crucial metrics, particularly in measuring imbalanced dataset classification performance. The application of multi-objective optimization techniques helps to strike a suitable balance between precision and recall. In addition to the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), 14 climatic indicators based on land, atmosphere, and sea are utilized. By employing the weighted dataset created with SOS-based MPSO, a significant improvement in recall value of 0.81 is achieved. Based on the weights assigned to the features, it is identified that the Mean Sea Level of the Arabian Sea and CO2 are significant indicators for predicting meteorological drought. The Explainable AI techniques SHAP and LIME are employed for interpreting the drought prediction model, providing insights into its workings.

AB  - This paper proposes an approach to diagnosing the skill of a machine-learning prediction model based on finding combinations of variables that minimize the normalized mean square error of the predictions. This technique is attractive because it compresses the positive skill of a forecast model into the smallest number of components. The resulting components can then be analyzed much like principal components, including the construction of regression maps for investigating sources of skill. The technique is illustrated with a machine-learning model of week 3-4 predictions of western US wintertime surface temperatures. The technique reveals at least two patterns of large-scale temperature variations that are skillfully predicted. The predictability of these patterns is generally consistent between climate model simulations and observations. The predictability is determined largely by sea surface temperature variations in the Pacific, particularly the region associated with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. This result is not surprising, but the fact that it emerges naturally from the technique demonstrates that the technique can be helpful in "explaining" the source of predictability in machine-learning models.
   Impact Statement
   Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for climate prediction, but the resulting models often are too complex to interpret. Methods for extracting meaningful knowledge from machine-learning models have been developed (e.g., explainable AI), but most of these methods apply only to low-dimensional outputs. In contrast, many climate applications require predicting spatial fields. This paper proposes an approach to reducing the dimension of the output by finding components with the most skill. This technique is illustrated by training separate machine-learning models at hundreds of spatial locations, and then using this technique to show that only a few patterns are predicted with significant skill. Individual patterns can then be analyzed using regression techniques to diagnose the source of the skill.

AB  - Precise irrigation management in vegetable production is key for optimizing water use and ensuring crop productivity. This study develops two types of artificial neural networks (ANNs), multilayer perceptron (MLPs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for the prediction of available water capacity (AWC in %) as target parameter for irrigation scheduling. These ANNs are trained with experimental data from three-year (2020-2023) open field trials with spinach on two sites in Germany, and for three soil layers (0-20 cm, 20-40 cm and 40-60 cm). This data encompassed soil texture, plant signals and plant developmental status derived from vegetation indices based on spectral reflectance along with meteorological variables including mean air temperature, humidity, wind speed, photothermal time, and their cumulative values. Two additional models are pretrained with freely accessible AWC data from 320 stations across Germany and subsequently fine-tuned with the same experimental data as before. An ANN ensemble model consolidates the knowledge from preceding models to enhance robustness and promote transferability to new climatic conditions and soil textures. Methods of explainable AI such as variable importance analysis and sensitivity analysis enhance the model explainability by identifying influential factors for each soil layer. Models trained with additional AWC data and fine-tuned with experimental performed best (R-2 > 0.98, RMSE <1.5 %) across all soil depths. The LSTM models perform slightly better than the MLP equivalent, emphasizing the importance of temporal dependencies in soil moisture prediction. The ensemble model minimized cumulative errors and provided stable results by averaging the outputs of all models. While ANNs provide highly accurate results, implementation requires expertise and resources of IT infrastructures such as the development of interfaces to weather stations and, if applicable, additional sensors. Consequently, deploying the ANN-based IS in practice requires a service provider with specialized knowledge in both IT and vegetable production for effective implementation and maintenance.

AB  - Irrigation water quality is crucial for sustainable agriculture and environmental health, influencing crop productivity and ecosystem balance globally. This study evaluates the performance of multiple deep learning models in classifying the Irrigation Water Quality Index (IWQI), addressing the challenge of accurate water quality prediction by examining the impact of increasing input complexity, particularly through chemical ions and derived quality indices. The models tested include convolutional neural networks (CNN), CNN-Long Short-Term Memory networks (CNN-LSTM), CNN-bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks (CNN-BiLSTM), and CNN-bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit networks (CNN-BiGRUs). Feature selection via SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) provided insights into individual feature contributions to the model predictions. The objectives were to compare the performance of 16 models and identify the most effective approach for accurate IWQI classification. This study utilized data from 166 wells in Algeria's Naama region, with 70% of the data for training and 30% for testing. Results indicate that the CNN-BiLSTM model outperformed others, achieving an accuracy of 0.94 and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.994. While CNN models effectively capture spatial features, they struggle with temporal dependencies-a limitation addressed by LSTM and BiGRU layers, which were further enhanced through bidirectional processing in the CNN-BiLSTM model. Feature importance analysis revealed that the quality index (qi) qi-Na was the most significant predictor in both Model 15 (0.68) and Model 16 (0.67). The quality index qi-EC showed a slight decrease in importance, from 0.19 to 0.18 between the models, while qi-SAR and qi-Cl maintained similar importance levels. Notably, Model 16 included qi-HCO3 with a minor importance score of 0.02. Overall, these findings underscore the critical role of sodium levels in water quality predictions and suggest areas for enhancing model performance. Despite the computational demands of the CNN-BiLSTM model, the results contribute to the development of robust models for effective water quality management, thereby promoting agricultural sustainability.

AB  - Objective This study systematically reviews and meta-analyzes existing risk prediction models for diabetic kidney disease (DKD) among patients with type 2 diabetes, aiming to provide references for scholars in China to develop higher-quality risk prediction models. Methods We searched databases including China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data, VIP Chinese Science and Technology Journal Database, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for studies on the construction of DKD risk prediction models among type 2 diabetes patients, up until 28 December 2023. Two researchers independently screened the literature and extracted and evaluated information according to a data extraction form and bias risk assessment tool for prediction model studies. The area under the curve (AUC) values of the models were meta-analyzed using STATA 14.0 software. Results A total of 32 studies were included, with 31 performing internal validation and 22 reporting calibration. The incidence rate of DKD among patients with type 2 diabetes ranged from 6.0% to 62.3%. The AUC ranged from 0.713 to 0.949, indicating the prediction models have fair to excellent prediction accuracy. The overall applicability of the included studies was good; however, there was a high overall risk of bias, mainly due to the retrospective nature of most studies, unreasonable sample sizes, and studies conducted in a single center. Meta-analysis of the models yielded a combined AUC of 0.810 (95% CI: 0.780-0.840), indicating good predictive performance. Conclusion Research on DKD risk prediction models for patients with type 2 diabetes in China is still in its initial stages, with a high overall risk of bias and a lack of clinical application. Future efforts could focus on constructing high-performance, easy-to-use prediction models based on interpretable machine learning methods and applying them in clinical settings.

AB  - BackgroundAcute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in critically ill patients with sepsis and is often associated with a poor prognosis. We aimed to construct and validate an interpretable prognostic prediction model for patients with sepsis-associated AKI (S-AKI) using machine learning (ML) methods.MethodsData on the training cohort were collected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database version 2.2 to build the model, and data of patients were extracted from Hangzhou First People's Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine for external validation of model. Predictors of mortality were identified using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE). Then, random forest, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), multilayer perceptron classifier, support vector classifier, and logistic regression were used to establish a prognosis prediction model for 7, 14, and 28 days after intensive care unit (ICU) admission, respectively. Prediction performance was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and decision curve analysis (DCA). SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were used to interpret the ML models.ResultsIn total, 2599 patients with S-AKI were included in the analysis. Forty variables were selected for the model development. According to the areas under the ROC curve (AUC) and DCA results for the training cohort, XGBoost model exhibited excellent performance with F1 Score of 0.847, 0.715, 0.765 and AUC (95% CI) of 0.91 (0.90, 0.92), 0.78 (0.76, 0.80), and 0.83 (0.81, 0.85) in 7 days, 14 days and 28 days group, respectively. It also demonstrated excellent discrimination in the external validation cohort. Its AUC (95% CI) was 0.81 (0.79, 0.83), 0.75 (0.73, 0.77), 0.79 (0.77, 0.81) in 7 days, 14 days and 28 days group, respectively. SHAP-based summary plot and force plot were used to interpret the XGBoost model globally and locally.ConclusionsML is a reliable tool for predicting the prognosis of patients with S-AKI. SHAP methods were used to explain intrinsic information of the XGBoost model, which may prove clinically useful and help clinicians tailor precise management.

AB  - Approximately 40% of total energy demand in the European Union is consumed by the residential buildings sector, thus also significantly contributing to carbon dioxide emissions. Circa 28% of this energy demand is attributed to space heating and cooling, primarily influenced by the building's envelope and need to ensure indoor thermal comfort. Given this significant energy consumption, there is an urgent imperative to explore energy-saving strategies and develop tools to assess the effects of various design alternatives, with a focus on wall and roof characteristics. While existing white and black-box predictive models lack generalisation capabilities, the goal of this study is to develop and train a domain-informed grey-box Deep Learning model called Temp-AI -Estimator to predict the indoor temperature of buildings and containers (acting as surrogates for residential or office buildings as well as intermodal containers) based on measurements of external meteorological conditions (e.g. exterior temperature, humidity, etc.), as well as physical properties due to building construction set-ups in questions ("ThermoProtect" (thin coating), "ThermoActive" (thick coating) and thermal insulation). The major difficulty lies in making the model generalise beyond the three geographical locations included in the dataset (Berlin, Abu Dhabi, Texel). Experiments with LSTMs and Transformers as baseline models showed overfitting on the particular conditions at the sites in the training set, while failing to generalise to a new out-of-sample location. We propose to pass the model the numerical derivatives of the time-sequences, as these are less location-specific. The estimation of the necessary initial/final conditions is delegated to a very small network to minimise the risk of overfitting. Furthermore, we included a physically motivated module for modelling the latency and difference in amplitudes between exterior conditions and interior temperatures, informed by numerical approximation schemes of the differential equation of thermal conduction. Our experiments show that our domain-informed network achieves an increase in accuracy of almost 40% in addition to yielding results that can easily be inspected by human experts due to interpretability and explainability.

AB  - Defect prediction models are proposed to help a team prioritize the areas of source code files that need Software Quality Assurance (SQA) based on the likelihood of having defects. However, developers may waste their unnecessary effort on the whole file while only a small fraction of its source code lines are defective. Indeed, we find that as little as 1-3 percent of lines of a file are defective. Hence, in this work, we propose a novel framework (called Line-DP) to identify defective lines using a model-agnostic technique, i.e., an Explainable AI technique that provides information why the model makes such a prediction. Broadly speaking, our Line-DP first builds a file-level defect model using code token features. Then, our Line-DP uses a state-of-the-art model-agnostic technique (i.e., LIME) to identify risky tokens, i.e., code tokens that lead the file-level defect model to predict that the file will be defective. Then, the lines that contain risky tokens are predicted as defective lines. Through a case study of 32 releases of nine Java open source systems, our evaluation results show that our Line-DP achieves an average recall of 0.61, a false alarm rate of 0.47, a top 20%LOC recall of 0.27, and an initial false alarm of 16, which are statistically better than six baseline approaches. Our evaluation shows that our Line-DP requires an average computation time of 10 seconds including model construction and defective line identification time. In addition, we find that 63 percent of defective lines that can be identified by our Line-DP are related to common defects (e.g., argument change, condition change). These results suggest that our Line-DP can effectively identify defective lines that contain common defects while requiring a smaller amount of inspection effort and a manageable computation cost. The contribution of this paper builds an important step towards line-level defect prediction by leveraging a model-agnostic technique.

AB  - Purpose: This concise review aims to explore the potential for the clinical implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) strategies for detecting glaucoma and monitoring glaucoma progression.
   Methods: Nonsystematic literature review using the search combinations "Artificial Intelligence," "Deep Learning," "Machine Learning," "Neural Networks," "Bayesian Networks," "Glaucoma Diagnosis," and "Glaucoma Progression." Information on sensitivity and specificity regarding glaucoma diagnosis and progression analysis as well as methodological details were extracted.
   Results: Numerous AI strategies provide promising levels of specificity and sensitivity for structural (e.g. optical coherence tomography [OCT] imaging, fundus photography) and functional (visual field [VF] testing) test modalities used for the detection of glaucoma. Area under receiver operating curve (AROC) values of > 0.90 were achieved with every modality. Combining structural and functional inputs has been shown to even more improve the diagnostic ability. Regarding glaucoma progression, AI strategies can detect progression earlier than conventional methods or potentially from one single VF test.
   Conclusions: AI algorithms applied to fundus photographs for screening purposes may provide good results using a simple and widely accessible test. However, for patients who are likely to have glaucoma more sophisticated methods should be used including data from OCT and perinnetry. Outputs may serve as an adjunct to assist clinical decision making, whereas also enhancing the efficiency, productivity, and quality of the delivery of glaucoma care. Patients with diagnosed glaucoma may benefitfronn future algorithms to evaluate their risk of progression. Challenges are yet to be overcome, including the external validity of AI strategies, a move from a "black box" toward "explainable AI," and likely regulatory hurdles. However, it is clear that AI can enhance the role of specialist clinicians and will inevitably shape the future of the delivery of glaucoma care to the next generation.
   Translational Relevance: The promising levels of diagnostic accuracy reported by AI strategies across the modalities used in clinical practice for glaucoma detection can pave the way for the development of reliable models appropriate for their translation into clinical practice. Future incorporation of AI into healthcare models may help address the current limitations of access and timely management of patients with glaucoma across the world.

AB  - Quantifying the emotional impact of street greening during the full-leaf seasons in spring, summer, and fall is important for well-being-focused urban construction. Current emotional perception models usually focus on the influence of objects identified through semantic segmentation of street view images and lack explanation. Therefore, interpretability models that quantify street greening's emotional effects are needed. This study aims to measure and explain the influence of street greening on emotions to help urban planners make decisions. This would improve the living environment, foster positive emotions, and help residents recover from negative emotions. In Hangzhou, China, we used the Baidu Map API to obtain street view images when plants were in the full-leaf state. Semantic segmentation was used to separate plant parts from street view images, enabling the calculation of the Green View Index, Plant Level Diversity, Plant Color Richness, and Tree-Sky View Factor. We created a dataset specifically designed for the purpose of emotional perception, including four distinct categories: pleasure, relaxation, boredom, and anxiety. This dataset was generated through a combination of machine learning algorithms and human evaluation. Scores range from 1 to 5, with higher values indicating stronger emotions and lower values indicating less intense ones. The random forest model and Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) algorithm were employed to identify the key indicators that affect emotions. Emotions were most affected by the Plant Level Diversity and Green View Index. These indicators and emotions have an intricate non-linear relationship. Specifically, a higher Green View Index (often indicating the presence of 20-35 fully grown trees within a 200 m range in street view images) and a greater Plant Level Diversity significantly promoted positive emotional responses. Our study provided local planning departments with support for well-being-focused urban planning and renewal decisions. Based on our research, we recommend the following actions: (1) increase the amount of visible green in areas with a low Green View Index; (2) plant seasonal and flowering plants like camellia, ginkgo, and goldenrain trees to enhance the diversity and colors; (3) trim plants in areas with low safety perception to improve visibility; (4) introduce evergreen plants like cinnamomum camphor, osmanthus, and pine.

AB  - Background:Perineural invasion (PNI) of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a strong independent risk factor for tumour recurrence and long-term patient survival. However, there is a lack of noninvasive tools for accurately predicting the PNI status. The authors develop and validate a combined model incorporating radiomics signature and clinicoradiological features based on machine learning for predicting PNI in ICC, and used the Shapley Additive explanation (SHAP) to visualize the prediction process for clinical application.Methods:This retrospective and prospective study included 243 patients with pathologically diagnosed ICC (training, n=136; external validation, n=81; prospective, n=26, respectively) who underwent preoperative contrast-enhanced computed tomography between January 2012 and May 2023 at three institutions (three tertiary referral centres in Guangdong Province, China). The ElasticNet was applied to select radiomics features and construct signature derived from computed tomography images, and univariate and multivariate analyses by logistic regression were used to identify the significant clinical and radiological variables with PNI. A robust combined model incorporating radiomics signature and clinicoradiological features based on machine learning was developed and the SHAP was used to visualize the prediction process. A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to compare prognostic differences between PNI-positive and PNI-negative groups and was conducted to explore the prognostic information of the combined model.Results:Among 243 patients (mean age, 61.2 years +/- 11.0 (SD); 152 men and 91 women), 108 (44.4%) were diagnosed as PNI-positive. The radiomics signature was constructed by seven radiomics features, with areas under the curves of 0.792, 0.748, and 0.729 in the training, external validation, and prospective cohorts, respectively. Three significant clinicoradiological features were selected and combined with radiomics signature to construct a combined model using machine learning. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting exhibited improved accuracy and robustness (areas under the curves of 0.884, 0.831, and 0.831, respectively). Survival analysis showed the construction combined model could be used to stratify relapse-free survival (hazard ratio, 1.933; 95% CI: 1.093-3.418; P=0.021).Conclusions:We developed and validated a robust combined model incorporating radiomics signature and clinicoradiological features based on machine learning to accurately identify the PNI statuses of ICC, and visualize the prediction process through SHAP for clinical application.

AB  - BackgroundThis study aimed to explore the impact of hypoxic hepatitis (HH) on survival in heart failure (HF) patients and to develop an effective machine learning model to predict 30-day mortality risk in HF patients with HH. MethodsIn the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III and IV databases, clinical data and survival situations of HF patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) were retrospectively collected. Propensity Score Matching (PSM) analysis was used to balance baseline differences between HF patients with and without HH. Kaplan Meier analysis and multivariate Cox analysis were used to determining the effect of HH on the survival of CF patients. For developing a model that can predict 30-day mortality in CF patients with HH, the feature recurrence elimination (RFE) method was applied to feature selection, and seven machine learning algorithms were employed to model construction. After training and hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) of the model through cross-validation in the training set, a performance comparison was performed through internal and external validation. To interpret the optimal model, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) were used along with the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and the Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) techniques. ResultsThe incidence of HH was 6.5% in HF patients in the MIMIC cohort. HF patients with HH had a 30-day mortality rate of 33% and a 1-year mortality rate of 51%, and HH was an independent risk factor for increased short-term and long-term mortality risk in HF patients. After RFE, 21 key features (21/56) were selected to build the model. Internal validation and external validation suggested that Categorical Boosting (Catboost) had a higher discriminatory capability than the other models (internal validation: AUC, 0.832; 95% CI, 0.819-0.845; external validation: AUC, 0.757 95% CI, 0.739-0.776), and the simplified Catboost model (S-Catboost) also had good performance in both internal validation and external validation (internal validation: AUC, 0.801; 95% CI, 0.787-0.813; external validation: AUC, 0.729, 95% CI, 0.711-0.745). ConclusionHH was associated with increased mortality in HF patients. Machine learning methods had good performance in identifying the 30-day mortality risk of HF with HH. With interpretability techniques, the transparency of machine learning models has been enhanced to facilitate user understanding of the prediction results.

TI  - Local Resource Solutions to Problematic Rural Road Access in Laos: Technical Monitoring of Trial Sections
T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA  - English
AB  - The South East Asia Community Access Programme (SEACAP) aimed to identify cost-effective, community-oriented approaches for improving year-round access to remote rural areas. The program promoted low-cost and local resource based improvements to roads. In 2007, trial surfacing sections were constructed on seven low-volume rural roads (LVRRs) near Houay Xai in Bokeo Province, northwest Laos. The surfaces included concrete, bituminous seals, stone, and gravel. The research sites were monitored after construction in 2007 and once more in 2009. However, after 2009 no funding was available to continue the monitoring and there was a risk of valuable knowledge being lost. To avoid that outcome, the African Community Access Programme (AFCAP) funded a third monitoring visit, which took place in October 2012. The objective was to assess the performance of the trial sections after they had been trafficked for 5 years. The information will be used to supplement knowledge gathered from a project in Tanzania, where demonstration sections have also been constructed and are being monitored. A separate paper on their performance has also been prepared. The present paper outlines the main findings from the monitoring process in Laos and makes some recommendations on the basis of these findings, particularly in relation to surfacing and pavement choice for LVRRs. Both SEACAP and AFCAP are funded by the United Kingdom Department for International Development.

AB  - Due to the intrinsic complexity of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) processes, it is always challenging to respond promptly and appropriately to the dynamic process conditions in order to ensure the quality of the effluent, especially when operational cost is a major concern. Machine Learning (ML) methods have therefore been used to model WWTP processes in order to avoid various shortcomings of conventional mechanistic models. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, no ML applications have focused on investigating how operational factors can affect effluent quality. Additionally, the time lags between process steps have always been neglected, making it difficult to explain the relationships between operational factors and effluent quality. Therefore, this paper presents a novel ML-based framework designed to improve effluent quality control in WWTPs by clarifying the relationships between operational variables and effluent parameters. The framework consists of Random Forest (RF) models, Deep Neural Network (DNN) models, Variable Importance Measure (VIM) analyses, and Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) analyses, and uses a novel approach to account for the impact of time lags between processes. Details of the framework are provided along with a demonstration of its practical applicability based on a case study of the lima WWTP in Sweden involving a large number of samples (105763) representing the full scale of the plant's operations. Two effluent parameters, Total Suspended Solids in effluent (TSSe) and Phosphate in effluent (PO4(e)), and thirty-two operational variables are studied. RF models are developed, validated using DNN models as references, and shown to be suitable for VIM and PDP analyses. VIM identifies the variables that most strongly influence TSSe and PO4(e), while PDP elucidates their specific effects on TSSe, and PO4(e). The major findings are: (1) Influent temperature is the most influential variable for both TSSe and PO4(e), but it affects them in different ways; (2) PO4(e) depends strongly on the TSS in aeration basins - higher TSS concentrations in aeration basins generally promote PO4 removal, but excess TSS can have negative effects; (3) In general, the impact of TSS in aeration basins on TSSe and PO4(e) increases with the distances of the basin from the merging outlet, so more attention should be paid to the TSS concentration in the third or fourth aeration basins than the first and second ones; (4) Returning excessive amounts of sludge through the second return sludge pipe should be avoided because of its adverse impact on TSSe removal. These results could support the development of more advanced control strategies to increase control precision and reduce running costs in the Umea WWTP and other similarly configured WWTPs. The framework could also be applied to other parameters in WWTPs and industrial processes in general if sufficient high-resolution data are available. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Debris flow has always been a serious problem in mountainous areas. Accurate debris flow susceptibility (DFS) assessment and interpretable prediction results play an important role in the prevention and control of debris flow disasters. Some commonly used machine learning algorithms based on Boosting ensemble techniques were widely used in the study of geohazard susceptibility due to its excellent predictive ability. However, the Categorical Boosting (CatBoost) and Natural Gradient Boosting (NGBoost) have not yet been applied in the field of DFS assessment, and few geohazard studies systematically compare and research these boosting-based algorithms. Meanwhile, previous researches have mostly focused on comparing the predictive ability of algorithms, identifying the susceptibility zones of the entire study area, and ranking the importance of the indicators, but little thorough analysis of the relationship between the indicators and debris flow susceptibility on different types of construction land. The aims of this study were to explore the optimal boosting-based DFS model, and the distribution characteristics and change rules of DFS in the study area, so as to provide decision supports for debris flow disaster prevention and reduction. This was the first time that six boosting-based machine learning algorithms have been compared in the study of DFS assessment. After determining the optimal model, the change rules of indicators in the entire study area and two types of construction lands under different DFS levels were studied respectively. An eXplainable Artifcial Intelligence (XAI) method called SHapley Additive exPlantations (SHAP), combined with zonal statistics function in geographic information system (GIS) were adopted to explore how each indicator affects the occurrence of debris flows. The results showed that the CatBoost performed best and provided the most reasonable DFS result among six boosting-based models. We found that debris flows were more likely to occur along rivers and construction lands at low altitude. Rural areas faced more stronger pressure from rainfall and were featured by worse disaster-breeding environment than urban areas. This research enriches the application of machine learning in DFS assessment, explores the changing trends of indicators between different DFS levels, and provides suggestions for better debris flow disaster prevention and mitigation management.

AB  - Hemp bio-composite (HBC) is a sustainable material that can be considered as a "carbon negative" or "better-than-zero-carbon" because it absorbs more carbon from its surrounding than it releases during its manufacturing and application on the field. Because of their eco-friendliness, these bio-composites not only improve structure thermal efficiency but also encourage sustainable construction. However, due to its heterogeneous nature, the majority of the published research has experimentally investigated the characteristics of bio-composites. While the mathematical models remain still a challenge for academics. Therefore, three machine learning methods known as deep neural network (DNN), gene expression programming (GEP), and optimizable Gaussian process regressor (OGPR) are used to build up prediction models for compressive strength (CS) and thermal conductivity (TC) of hemp bio-composite. A total of 86 and 159 experimental values for TC and CS, respectively, were collected from the literature. To formulate the models, the ten most dominant input variables were chosen. To evaluate the performance of the models, various statistical metrics were employed. Based on statistical indicators, the increasing order of prediction capabilities of the established models is DNN>OGPR>GEP. The value of the correlation coefficient (R) for CS models is 0.9893 (GEP), 0.9997 (DNN), and 0.9995 (OGPR). While that for TC models are 0.9847 (GEP), 0.9999 (DNN), and 0.9999 (OGPR). The values of the performance index (r) and objective function (OF) are approaching 0. Thus, indicating the outburst performance of the developed models. The comparison of machine learning (ML) models with traditional regression models further confirms the accuracy of the developed models. Furthermore, contour maps analysis was conducted to get an insight into the ranges of input variables that were employed by global researchers to gain higher strength and thermal properties. For the interpretation of the models, Shapley Additive explanations (SHAP) analysis was carried out. The result revealed that the influencing trend of input variables is in close agreement with experimental studies. Thus, practi-tioners and designers to avoid hectic experimental tests to save time and cost can utilize these ML-based developed models in field projects. However, it is recommended to use more updated and extensive data to further validate the models and utilize other ML al-gorithms and post hoc interpretation techniques for the model's explanations.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the advantages and applications of machine learning models in predicting the risk of allergic rhinitis (AR) in children aged 2-8, compared to traditional logistic regression. The study analyzed questionnaire data from 7131 children aged 2-8, which was randomly divided into training, validation, and testing sets in a ratio of 55:15:30, repeated 100 times. Predictor variables included parental allergy, medical history during the child's first year (cfy), and early life environmental factors. The time of first onset of AR was restricted to after the age of 1 year to establish a clear temporal relationship between the predictor variables and the outcome. Feature engineering utilized the chi-square test and the Boruta algorithm, refining the dataset for analysis. The construction utilized Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting Tree (XGBoost) as the models. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), and the optimal decision threshold was determined by weighing multiple metrics on the validation sets and reporting results on the testing set. Additionally, the strengths and limitations of the different models were comprehensively analyzed by stratifying gender, mode of birth, and age subgroups, as well as by varying the number of predictor variables. Furthermore, methods such as Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) and purity of node partition in Random Forest were employed to assess feature importance, along with exploring model stability through alterations in the number of features. In this study, 7131 children aged 2-8 were analyzed, with 524 (7.35%) diagnosed with AR, with an onset age ranging from 2 to 8 years. Optimal parameters were refined using the validation set, and a rigorous process of 100 random divisions and repeated training ensured robust evaluation of the models on the testing set. The model construction involved incorporating fourteen variables, including the history of allergy-related diseases during the child's first year, familial genetic factors, and early-life indoor environmental factors. The performance of LR, SVM, RF, and XGBoost on the unstratified data test set was 0.715 (standard deviation = 0.023), 0.723 (0.022), 0.747 (0.015), and 0.733 (0.019), respectively; the performance of each model was stable on the stratified data, and the RF performance was significantly better than that of LR (paired samples t-test: p < 0.001). Different techniques for evaluating the importance of features showed that the top5 variables were father or mother with AR, having older siblings, history of food allergy and father's educational level. Utilizing strategies like stratification and adjusting the number of features, this study constructed a random forest model that outperforms traditional logistic regression. Specifically designed to detect the occurrence of allergic rhinitis (AR) in children aged 2-8, the model incorporates parental allergic history and early life environmental factors. The selection of the optimal cut-off value was determined through a comprehensive evaluation strategy. Additionally, we identified the top 5 crucial features that greatly influence the model's performance. This study serves as a valuable reference for implementing machine learning-based AR prediction in pediatric populations.

AB  - This paper argues that explainability is only one facet of a broader ideal that shapes our expectations towards artificial intelligence (AI). Fundamentally, the issue is to what extent AI exhibits systematicity-not merely in being sensitive to how thoughts are composed of recombinable constituents, but in striving towards an integrated body of thought that is consistent, coherent, comprehensive, and parsimoniously principled. This richer conception of systematicity has been obscured by the long shadow of the "systematicity challenge" to connectionism, according to which network architectures are fundamentally at odds with what Fodor and colleagues termed "the systematicity of thought." I offer a conceptual framework for thinking about "the systematicity of thought" that distinguishes four senses of the phrase. I use these distinctions to defuse the perceived tension between systematicity and connectionism and show that the conception of systematicity that historically shaped our sense of what makes thought rational, authoritative, and scientific is more demanding than the Fodorian notion. To determine whether we have reason to hold AI models to this ideal of systematicity, I then argue, we must look to the rationales for systematization and explore to what extent they transfer to AI models. I identify five such rationales and apply them to AI. This brings into view the "hard systematicity challenge." However, the demand for systematization itself needs to be regulated by the rationales for systematization. This yields a dynamic understanding of the need to systematize thought, which tells us how systematic we need AI models to be and when.

AB  - Energy performance in detached homes is critical for reducing carbon emissions in United Kingdom. However, understanding the complex factors that affect Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) ratings remains limited. Detached homes face unique challenges due to their larger floor areas and greater environmental exposure. Despite the significance of EPCs in driving energy efficiency, the diagnostic analysis of feature interactions at the class level (A-G) is underexplored, especially in detached homes. This study addresses this gap by employing predictive explainability to provide a detailed, rating class-wise diagnostic analysis of the predictive power of structural and operational features for detached homes. We investigate key factors such as CO2 emissions per floor area, heating costs, window, floor, walls efficiency, and construction age, and explore how these features interact to drive EPC ratings. Our findings show that CO2 emissions and heating costs are the primary drivers of EPC classification, but their impact varies across EPC bands. Detached homes in lower EPC categories (E-G) exhibit heightened sensitivity to high emissions and inefficient heating, while properties in EPC A and B benefit from improved insulation and efficient systems. This study introduces an innovative diagnostic framework that not only identifies key predictive features for each EPC class but also uncovers the synergistic effects of feature combinations. The results provide actionable insights for retrofit strategies and policy interventions, particularly for detached homes, offering a roadmap for improving energy efficiency and advancing sustainable energy practices.

TI  - Machine Learning Assisted Material Discovery: A Small Data Approach
T2  - ACCOUNTS OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
LA  - English
KW  - ELECTROCATALYSTS
AB  - The data-driven paradigm, represented by the famous machine learning paradigm, is revolutionizing the way materials are discovered. The inductive nature of the data-driven approach gives it great speed of prediction but also brings with it a heavy reliance on material data. However, unlike its success with text and images, which are supported by big data, materials data tend to be small data. Building a large database of materials is a good solution but not a permanent one. The cost of materials data is much higher than that of text or images, and the size of the materials database at this stage is far from sufficient. We will continue to face a shortage of materials data for a long time to come, making small data approaches necessary for machine learning based materials discovery.In this Account, we focus on small data strategies developed over the past few years and the scenarios in which they are used. In the first part, we discuss two general strategies, active learning and transfer learning, which are ways of adding new data efficiently and using existing data, respectively. The key to active learning is the sampling strategy, which determines the speed of convergence and the predictive range of the machine learning model. For transfer learning, adversarial training is introduced to extend the scope of this strategy, allowing for knowledge transfer across materials and properties. We also discuss other small data approaches for special cases, such as material search with zero initial data and model training on multisource experimental data. In the second part, we focus on the construction of material descriptors and reduction of their dimensionality. We have developed a crystal-graph-based descriptor specifically for two-dimensional materials. It can encode both structural and atomic information and also has a flexible multilayer format for different target properties. Since the dimensionality of the material descriptor is limited by the amount of data, specially designed dimensionality reduction strategies are also discussed. In the third part, we discuss model interpretability. Several examples are given to illustrate how model-based and data-based interpretation strategies can be used to help us understand the machine learning model and its prediction results.The Account concludes with our perspectives on the latest developments in generative AI (in particular, large language model and diffusion model) and explainable AI, which could be powerful tools in the future of machine learning assisted material discovery.

AB  - We, the Hailzaqv, Kitasoo Xai'xais, Nuxalk and Wuikinuxv First Nations, are the traditional stewards of our territories in the Central Coast of British Columbia, Canada. Our traditional laws obligate us to manage and protect our territories for current and future generations. Spatial management is inherent to our cultures through the Hereditary Chief governance system, in which specific people within a lineage inherit the rights and responsibilities for stewarding specific areas. Since the 19th century, we have been experiencing cultural disruptions caused by settler colonialism, which are now worsened by the declines of marine species vital to our cultures. These declines reflect fishery impacts exacerbated by climate change. Western fisheries management focuses on maximum sustained yields (MSY), ignoring body size declines that disrupt food webs and diminish population productivity for vertebrate and invertebrate taxa, thereby eroding resilience to climate change. The worldview encompassed by the MSY framework-take the most that you can without compromising future exploitation while assuming no environmental change-is the antithesis of ours-take only what you need and leave lots for the ecosystem. Furthermore, standard stock assessments do not account for uncertainties inherent to climate change effects on distributions and productivity, and many by-catch species are unassessed. Consistent with our traditional knowledge, scientific evidence indicates that marine protected areas (MPAs), coupled with other measures to reduce fishing mortality, can restore exploited species, safeguard biodiversity and contribute to fisheries sustainability. In the 2000s, we paired Indigenous knowledge and Western science to develop marine spatial plans. These plans are foundational in our contribution to the ongoing development of the Marine Protected Area Network for Canada's Northern Shelf Bioregion (MPAN-NSB), for which we are co-governance partners with 14 other First Nations and the governments of Canada and British Columbia. Our proposed spatial protections for the MPAN-NSB encompass areas important to many exploited taxa and to corals, sponges, eelgrass beds and other carbon stores. Their implementation would fill conservation gaps which have persisted under current fishery management. Given our history of spatial management through the Hereditary Chief governance system, the MPAN-NSB is a culturally appropriate way forward for marine conservation in our territories.

AB  - Background Intensive-care units (ICUs) treat the most critically ill patients, which is complicated by the heterogeneity of the diseases that they encounter. Severity scores based mainly on acute physiology measures collected at ICU admission are used to predict mortality, but are non-specific, and predictions for individual patients can be inaccurate. We investigated whether inclusion of long-term disease history before ICU admission improves mortality predictions.
   Methods Registry data for long-term disease histories for more than 230 000 Danish ICU patients were used in a neural network to develop an ICU mortality prediction model. Long-term disease histories and acute physiology measures were aggregated to predict mortality risk for patients for whom both registry and ICU electronic patient record data were available. We compared mortality predictions with admission scores on the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II, the Acute Physiologic Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II, and the best available multimorbidity score, the Multimorbidity Index. An external validation set from an additional hospital was acquired after model construction to confirm the validity of our model. During initial model development data were split into a training set (85%) and an independent test set (15%), and a five-fold cross-validation was done during training to avoid overfitting. Neural networks were trained for datasets with disease history of 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2.5 years, 5 years, 7.5 years, 10 years, and 23 years before ICU admission.
   Findings Mortality predictions with a model based solely on disease history outperformed the Multimorbidity Index (Matthews correlation coefficient 0.265 vs 0.065), and performed similarly to SAPS II and APACHE II (Matthews correlation coefficient with disease history, age, and sex 0.326 vs 0.347 and 0.300 for SAPS II and APACHE II, respectively). Diagnoses up to 10 years before ICU admission affected current mortality prediction. Aggregation of previous disease history and acute physiology measures in a neural network yielded the most precise predictions of in-hospital mortality (Matthews correlation coefficient 0.391 for in-hospital mortality compared with 0.347 with SAPS II and 0.300 with APACHE II). These results for the aggregated model were validated in an external independent dataset of 1528 patients (Matthews correlation coefficient for prediction of in-hospital mortality 0.341).
   Interpretation Longitudinal disease-spectrum-wide data available before ICU admission are useful for mortality prediction. Disease history can be used to differentiate mortality risk between patients with similar vital signs with more precision than SAPS II and APACHE II scores. Machine learning models can be deconvoluted to generate novel understandings of how ICU patient features from long-term and short-term events interact with each other. Explainable machine learning models are key in clinical settings, and our results emphasise how to progress towards the transformation of advanced models into actionable, transparent, and trustworthy clinical tools.

AB  - Ambient air pollution is a pervasive global issue that poses significant health risks. Among pollutants, ozone ( O 3 ) is responsible for an estimated 1 to 1.2 million premature deaths yearly. Furthermore, O 3 adversely affects climate warming, crop productivity, and more. Its formation occurs when nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds react with short -wavelength solar radiation. Consequently, urban areas with high traffic volume and elevated temperatures are particularly prone to elevated O 3 levels, which pose a significant health risk to their inhabitants. In response to this problem, many countries have developed web and mobile applications that provide real-time air pollution information using sensor data. However, while these applications offer valuable insight into current pollution levels, predicting future pollutant behavior is crucial for effective planning and mitigation strategies. Therefore, our main objectives are to develop accurate and efficient prediction models and identify the key factors that influence O 3 levels. We adopt a time series forecasting approach to address these objectives, which allows us to analyze and predict future O 3 behavior. Additionally, we tackle the feature selection problem to identify the most relevant features and periods that contribute to prediction accuracy by introducing a novel method called the Time Selection Layer in Deep Learning models, which significantly improves model performance, reduces complexity, and enhances interpretability. Our study focuses on data collected from five representative areas in Seville, Cordova, and Jaen provinces in Spain, using multiple sensors to capture comprehensive pollution data. We compare the performance of three models: Lasso, Decision Tree, and Deep Learning with and without incorporating the Time Selection Layer. Our results demonstrate that including the Time Selection Layer significantly enhances the effectiveness and interpretability of Deep Learning models, achieving an average effectiveness improvement of 9% across all monitored areas.

AB  - Environmental management (EM) requires indicators to inform objectives and monitor the impacts or efficacy of management practices. One common approach uses "functional ecological" indicators, which are typically species whose presence or abundance are tied to functional ecological processes, such as nutrient productivity and availability, trophic interactions, and habitat connectivity. In contrast, and used for millennia by Indigenous peoples, biocultural indicators are rooted in local values and place-based relationships between nature and people. In many landscapes today where Indigenous peoples are reasserting sovereignty and governance authority over natural resources, the functional ecological approach to indicator development does not capture fundamental values and ties to the natural world that have supported social-ecological systems over the long term. Accordingly, we argue that the development and use of biocultural indicators to shape, monitor, and evaluate the success of EM projects will be critical to achieving ecological and social sustainability today. We have provided a framework composed of criteria to be considered when selecting and applying meaningful and efficacious biocultural indicators among the diverse array of potential species and values. We used a case study from a region now referred to as coastal British Columbia, Canada, to show how the suggested application of functional ecological indicators by the provincial government created barriers to the development of meaningful cogovernance. We then explained how the Kitasoo/Xai'xais First Nation designed and implemented a bioculturally relevant suite of indicators in their own EM and monitoring processes. Drawing on our experiences there and both the biocultural and functional ecological literature, we proposed six generalizable criteria (culturally salient, inclusive, sensitive to impacts, supportive of place-based relationships, perceptible, and linked to human well-being) that can guide resource stewards and agencies in selecting locally relevant indicators to implement biocultural EM and monitor the performance of outcomes.

AB  - A new paradigm driven by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) is significantly accelerating the iterative pace of polymer materials research. Traditional experimental approaches to polymer discovery have long relied on trial and error, requiring extensive time and resources while offering limited access to the vast chemical design space. In contrast, ML-assisted strategies provide a transformative framework for efficiently navigating this complex landscape. This paper focuses specifically on polymer design at the molecular level. By integrating data-driven methodologies, researchers can extract structure-property relationships, predict polymer properties, and optimize molecular architectures with unprecedented speed. ML-driven polymer design follows a structured approach: (1) database construction, (2) structural representation and feature engineering, (3) development of ML-based property prediction models, (4) virtual screening of potential candidates, and (5) validation through experiments and/or numerical simulations. This workflow faces two central challenges. First is the limited availability of high-quality polymer datasets, particularly for advanced materials with specialized properties. Second is the generation of virtual polymer structures. Unlike small-molecule drug discovery, where vast libraries of candidate compounds exist, polymer chemistry lacks an equivalent repository of hypothetical structures. Recent efforts have leveraged rule-based polymerization reactions and generative models to create large-scale databases of hypothetical polymers, significantly expanding the design space. Additionally, the diversity of polymer structures, the broad range of their properties, and the limited availability of training samples add complexity to developing accurate predictive models. Addressing these challenges requires innovative ML techniques, such as transfer learning, multitask learning, and generative models, to extract meaningful insights from sparse data and improve prediction reliability. This data-driven approach has enabled the discovery of novel, high-performance polymers for applications in aerospace, electronics, energy storage, and biomedical engineering. Despite these advancements, several hurdles remain. The interpretability of ML models, particularly deep neural networks, is a pressing concern. While black-box models can achieve remarkable predictive accuracy, understanding their decision-making processes remains challenging. Explainable AI methods are increasingly being explored to provide insights into feature importance, model uncertainty, and the underlying chemistry driving polymer properties. Additionally, the synthesizability and processability of ML-generated candidates must be carefully considered to ensure practical experimental validation and real-world application. In this paper, we review recent progress in ML-assisted molecular design of polymer materials, focusing on database development, feature representation, predictive modeling, and virtual polymer generation. We highlight emerging methodologies, including transformer-based language models, physics-informed neural networks, and closed-loop discovery frameworks, which collectively enhance the efficiency and accuracy of polymer informatics.
   Finally, we discuss the future outlook of ML-driven polymer research, emphasizing the need for collaborative efforts between data scientists, chemists, and engineers to refine predictive models, integrate experimental validation, and accelerate the development of next-generation polymeric materials. By leveraging the synergy between computational modeling and experimental insights, ML-assisted design is poised to revolutionize polymer discovery, enabling the rapid development of sustainable, high-performance materials tailored for diverse applications.

AB  - BackgroundUnderstanding the intricacies of wildfire impact across diverse geographical landscapes necessitates a nuanced comprehension of fire dynamics and areas of vulnerability, particularly in regions prone to high wildfire risks. Machine learning (ML) stands as a formidable ally in addressing the complexities associated with predicting and mapping these risks, offering advanced analytical capabilities. Nevertheless, the reliability of such ML approaches is heavily contingent on the integrity of data and the robustness of training protocols. The scientific community has raised concerns about the transparency and interpretability of ML models in the context of wildfire management, recognizing the need for these models to be both accurate and understandable. The often-opaque nature of complex ML algorithms can obscure the rationale behind their outputs, making it imperative to prioritize clarity and interpretability to ensure that model predictions are not only precise but also actionable. Furthermore, a thorough evaluation of model performance must account for multiple critical factors to ensure the utility and dependability of the results in practical wildfire suppression and management strategies.ResultsThis study unveils a sophisticated spatial deep learning framework grounded in TabNet technology, tailored specifically for delineating areas susceptible to wildfires. To elucidate the predictive interplay between the model's outputs and the contributing variables across a spectrum of inputs, we embark on an exhaustive analysis using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). This approach affords a granular understanding of how individual features sway the model's predictions. Furthermore, the robustness of the predictive model is rigorously validated through 5-fold cross-validation techniques, ensuring the dependability of the findings. The research meticulously investigates the spatial heterogeneity of wildfire susceptibility within the designated study locale, unearthing pivotal insights into the nuanced fabric of fire risk that is distinctly local in nature.ConclusionUtilizing SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) visualizations, this research meticulously identifies key variables, quantifies their importance, and demystifies the decision-making mechanics of the model. Critical factors, including temperature, elevation, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), aspect, and wind speed, are discerned to have significant sway over the predictions of wildfire susceptibility. The findings of this study accentuate the criticality of transparency in modeling, which facilitates a deeper understanding of wildfire risk factors. By shedding light on the significant predictors within the models, this work enhances our ability to interpret complex predictive models and drives forward the field of wildfire risk management, ultimately contributing to the development of more effective prevention and mitigation strategies.
   AntecedentesEl entender las complejidades de los impactos de los incendios de vegetacion a traves de los diversos paisajes geograficos, requieren de una detallada comprension de la dinamica del fuego y de las areas de vulnerabilidad, particularmente en regiones propensas y con alto riesgo de incendios. El aprendizaje automatico (Machine Learning o ML, en idioma ingles), aparece como un formidable aliado para abordar las complejidades asociadas con la prediccion y el mapeo de esos riesgos. Sin embargo, la confiabilidad de estos enfoques usando esta tecnica de aprendizaje automatico (ML) es altamente dependiente de la integridad de los datos y de la robustez de los protocolos de entrenamiento. La comunidad cientifica ha sembrado dudas sobre la transparencia e interpretacion de los modelos de ML en el contexto del manejo del fuego, reconociendo la necesidad de que esos modelos sean a su vez precisos y entendibles. La frecuentemente opaca naturaleza de los complejos algoritmos del ML, pueden oscurecer la racionalidad que debe haber por detras de los resultados, haciendose imperativo el priorizar la claridad e interpretacion para asegurar que los modelos de prediccion no solo sean precisos sino tambien procesables. Adicionalmente, una completa evaluacion de la performance del modelo en cuanto a los multiples factores criticos debe tenerse en cuenta para asegurar la utilidad y dependencia de los resultados en estrategias de practicas de supresion y manejo del fuego.ResultadosEste estudio devela un marco espacialmente sofisticado de aprendizaje profundo (deeep learnig) basado en tecnologia de TabNet, disenado especificamente para delinear areas susceptibles a incendios de vegetacion. Para dilucidar las interacciones predictivas entre los resultados del modelo y las variables contributivas a traves de un espectro de entradas, nos embarcamos en un analisis exhaustivo usando SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Esta aproximacion aborda un entendimiento granular sobre como las caracteristicas individuales influencian las predicciones del modelo. Ademas, la robustez del modelo predictivo fue rigurosamente validado 5 veces a traves de tecnicas de validacion cruzadas, asegurando la dependencia de los resultados. EL trabajo investigo meticulosamente la variabilidad espacial de la susceptibilidad dentro del estudio local, desenterrando ideas fundamentales sobre riesgo de incendios que implican matices distintivos de naturaleza local.ConclusionesUtilizando visualizaciones del SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), esta investigacion identifico meticulosamente variables clave, cuantifico su importancia y desmitifico la mecanica de toma de decisiones del modelo. Los factores criticos, incluyendo temperatura, elevacion, el NDVI (indice Normalizado de Diferencias de Vegetacion), aspecto, y velocidad del viento, fueron descifrados para que tengan una influencia significativa en la prediccion de la susceptibilidad a los incendios. Los resultados de este estudio acentuan la critica a la transparencia de los modelos, lo que facilita un entendimiento mas profundo de los factores criticos del riesgo de incendios. Mediante el esclarecimiento de los predictores significativos del modelo, este trabajo aumenta nuestra habilidad para interpretar modelos predictivos complejos, e impulsa hacia adelante el campo del manejo del riesgo de incendios, contribuyendo en ultima instancia al desarrollo de estrategias de prevencion y mitigacion mas efectivas.

TI  - Interpretable machine learning for predicting isolated basal septal hypertrophy
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
KW  - ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY
AB  - Background The basal septal hypertrophy(BSH) is an often under-recognized morphological change in the left ventricle. This is a common echocardiographic finding with a prevalence of approximately 7-20%, which may indicate early structural and functional remodeling of the left ventricle in certain pathologies. It also poses a risk of severe left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and is a significant cause of postoperative complications in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Compared to traditional algorithms, machine learning algorithms are more effective at capturing nonlinear relationships and developing more accurate diagnostic and predictive models. However, no predictive models for BSH have been developed using machine learning algorithms.Background The basal septal hypertrophy(BSH) is an often under-recognized morphological change in the left ventricle.

It also poses a risk of severe left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and is a significant cause of postoperative complications in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Compared to traditional algorithms, machine learning algorithms are more effective at capturing nonlinear relationships and developing more accurate diagnostic and predictive models. However, no predictive models for BSH have been developed using machine learning algorithms.Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of five machine learning algorithms in predicting thickening of the basal segment of the interventricular septum and to develop a simple, yet efficient, prediction model for BSH.Methods Echocardiographic and clinical data from 902 patients were collected from the First Central Hospital of Baoding City, including 91 BSH patients and 811 non-BSH patients. The data were divided into training and test sets in a 7:3 ratio. Five machine learning algorithms -XGBoost, Random Forest(RF), Dicision tree(DT), K-Nearest Neighbor classification(KNN), and Naive Bayes(NB) were applied to construct the models, combined with logistic regression (LR) based on Lasso regression. The performance of each model was evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC),calibration curves and Decision Curve Analysis (DCA)curve, with the model demonstrating the best performance being selected. The shapley additive explanation (SHAP) method was employed to interpret the XBoost and RF models.Results The logistic regression (LR) of the Lasso regression model showed that IVS-AO Angle, Left Ventricular Mass Index (LVMI), Diastolic Left Ventricular Internal Diameter Index (LVIDdI), Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP), Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP), Distance from mitral valve closure point to basal segment of interventricular septum (MVCP-Sd), GLU, and Mitral Valve peak A (MV-A) were associated with BSH, with odds ratios (OR) of 0.86 (0.831-0.888), 1.034 (1.018-1.052), 0.104 (0.023-0.403), 1.041 (1.021-1.064), 0.964 (0.93-0.998), 0.852 (0.764-0.949), 1.146 (1.023-1.281), and 0.967 (0.947-0.987), respectively. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for Model-relevant variable IVS-AO Angle, MVCP_Sd,LVMI, GLU, LVIDdI, SBP,DBP,LVIDdI,MV_A were 0.87,0.68,0.66,0.55,0.56,0.67,0.75,0.75. The AUC for the algorithms (XGBoost, RF, DT, KNN, NB) in the test set were 0.92, 0.91, 0.85, 0.84, and 0.88, respectively.
   The SHAP method identified eight predictor variables for BSH based on importance rankings, with the top four being IVS-AO Angle, LVMI, LVIDdI, and SBP, with IVS-AO Angle emerging as the most important predictor. The external validation of the RF model yielded an AUC of 0.86.Results The logistic regression (LR) of the Lasso regression model showed that IVS-AO Angle, Left Ventricular Mass Index (LVMI), Diastolic Left Ventricular Internal Diameter Index (LVIDdI), Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP), Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP), Distance from mitral valve closure point to basal segment of interventricular septum (MVCP-Sd), GLU, and Mitral Valve peak A (MV-A) were associated with BSH, with odds ratios (OR) of 0.86 (0.831-0.888), 1.034 (1.018-1.052), 0.104 (0.023-0.403), 1.041 (1.021-1.064), 0.964 (0.93-0.998), 0.852 (0.764-0.949), 1.146 (1.023-1.281), and 0.967 (0.947-0.987), respectively. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for Model-relevant variable IVS-AO Angle, MVCP_Sd,LVMI, GLU, LVIDdI, SBP,DBP,LVIDdI,MV_A were 0.87,0.68,0.66,0.55,0.56,0.67,0.75,0.75. The AUC for the algorithms (XGBoost, RF, DT, KNN, NB) in the test set were 0.92, 0.91, 0.85, 0.84, and 0.88, respectively. The SHAP method identified eight predictor variables for BSH based on importance rankings, with the top four being IVS-AO Angle, LVMI, LVIDdI, and SBP, with IVS-AO Angle emerging as the most important predictor. The external validation of the RF model yielded an AUC of 0.86.Conclusion Machine learning can effectively predict BSH, with IVS-AO Angle identified as an independent predictor. The RF model, being simple to operate, can be applied to the risk management of BSH patients.
